Dominant/recessive:  Yevgeny and Grizelda are planning to have a child.  The gene that causes knuckle hair is the dominant allele and is represented by Q.  The recessive trait, q, results in bald knuckles.  Yevgeny is heterozygous for the trait, and Grizelda is homozygous recessive.   What is the probability that their first child will have bald knuckles?  [prob1] What is the probability that their first child will be heterozygous for the knuckle hair gene?  [prob2] What is Yevgeny's phenotype?  [prob3]

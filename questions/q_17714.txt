A subcutaneous pocket was created with the cautery on the pectoralis fascia.  An introducer dilator was passed over the first wire and the wire and dilator were withdrawn.  A ventricular lead was passed through the introducer, and the introducer was broken away in the routine fashion.  A second introducer dilator was passed over the second guide wire and the wire and dilator were withdrawn.  An atrial lead was passed through the introducer and the introducer was broken away in the routine fashion.  Each of the leads were sutured down to the chest wall with two 2-0 silk sutures each, connected the leads to the generator, curled the leads, and the generator was placed in the pocket.  We assured hemostasis.  We assured good position with the fluoroscopy.  What CPT code(s) is (are) reported by the cardiologist?

Questions: Olia: SAR-Olia-and-Baby-W-Final-Report-REDACTED EXAM SAR-1.pdf    This SAR was commissioned by Manchester Safeguarding Adults Board because Olia and her new born baby, Baby W, were found dead at their home. Police were called to an address in a neighbouring authority by a neighbour who reported concerns for the welfare of the person who lived there. The police forced entry and found Olia dead on the floor with a small baby (Baby W) who was also found to be dead.   Olia sought antenatal care as soon as she was pregnant with Baby W and she told professionals that this was her first pregnancy. Information then emerged that she had three older children removed from her care in London because of significant concerns about neglect and her own mental health difficulties. A referral was made to children's social care and they struggled to make contact with her because of confusion about her address and her reluctance to see professionals. She then went overseas for a period of time without telling anyone. The police were notified of her return and she was met at the airport by social workers. Professionals were unable to make contact with Olia for the last few weeks of the pregnancy.

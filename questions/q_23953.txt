There is a [p]0% chance a computer server will stay operational (i.e. doesn't crash) all day. If a company's website uses [n] servers acting independently, find the probability that the site stays up all day (i.e. find the probability that at least 1 server stays operational all day). Leave your answer as a decimal and do not round. Hint: First use the complement rule to find the probability a single server crashes in a day. Then use the multiplication rule to find the probability that all servers will crash in a day. Then, finally, use the complement rule again to find the probability that at least one stays operational all day.

You have 2.00L of water at room temperature in a closed pasta pot on a stove.  How much energy do you need to bring the water to its boiling temperature? How long will this take given that the stove operates at 1500. Watts, and heat transfer from the stove to the pot is only 30.0% efficient? Your answer should be in minutes.  Before solving, write the general energy balance equation and then simplify. Tables are provided below.

Question 1Multipart question (Tests the Core outcomes 1 and 2) (Total 20 points)START ON A NEW PAGE. SEPARATE EACH PART NICELY! BOX FINAL ANSWERS.     Write a TF (in gain-pole-zero format) which has poles at 0 and -1, a zero at -2, and a  gain of 3. (3 points)What is the dc gain of this TF?  (1 points) Write a 1st order TF such that if you give a unit step input to it, the solution starts from 0, and exponentially approaches 2. Also the solution should pass a value of 0.632*2 in 3 seconds. (4 points) Write a 2nd order TF such that if you give a unit step input to it, the solution starts from 0 (with zero slope), and exponentially approaches 2. Also the solution reaches within 2 plus/minus 0.04 in about 4 seconds, and the overshoot is exp(-3.14159) = 4.32% . (6 points) Just plot the unit step responses of in the same plot below. Mark which plot is for which TF. Note all the TFs have the same dc gain. (6 points)

Consider a 1-D heat conduction through a metal bar, as shown below in the schematic.  Mesh the bar into four equally distributed control volume.  Use finite volume method to give a matrix description of this problem in the form of [K] {T} = {BC} Where TA=300 oC, TB = 100 oC, the total length L=2m, and the cross-sectional area A is 0.01 m2 Thermal conductivity k = 1000 W/(m oC).  The diffusive heat flux can be described as Hint: you need put all the provided values into your calculation.

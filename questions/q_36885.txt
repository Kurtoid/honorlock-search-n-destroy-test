This is the same fact pattern as that above - Problem 2 part B. Clint noticed that the Schedule K-1 he just received from ABC Partnership included a $20,000 ordinary business loss allocation. His tax basis in ABC at the beginning of ABC's most recent tax year was $10,000. Comparing the Schedule K-1 he recently received from ABC with the Schedule K-1 he received from ABC last year, Clint noted that his share of ABC partnership debt changes as follows: recourse debt increased from $0 to $2,000, qualified nonrecourse debt increased from $0 to $3,000, and  nonrecourse debt increased from $0 to $3,000. Finally, the Schedule K-1 Clint received from ABC reflected a $1,000 cash contribution he made to ABC during the year. Clint is not a material participant in ABC Partnership, and he received $10,000 of passive income from another investment during the same year he received the loss allocation from ABC. B.

Questions 1-4 refer to the following passage: We are a young people. We inhabit a world apart, separated by broad seas. We are young in the ways of almost all the arts and sciences, although, in a certain manner, we are old in the ways of civilized society. I look upon the present state of America as similar to that of Rome after its fall. Each part of Rome adopted a political system conforming to its interest and situation or was led by the individual ambitions of certain chiefs, dynasties, or associations. But this important difference exists: those dispersed parts later reestablished their ancient nations, subject to the changes imposed by circumstances or extent. But we scarcely retain a vestige of what once was; we are, moreover, neither Indian nor European, but a species midway between the legitimate proprietors of this country and the Spanish usurpers. In short, although Americans by birth we derive our rights from Europe, and we have to assert these rights against the rights of the natives, and at the same time we must defend ourselves against the invaders. This places us in a most extraordinary and involved situation. . . . The role of the inhabitants of the American hemisphere has for centuries been purely passive. Politically they were nonexistent. We are still in a position lower than slavery, and therefore it is more difficult for us to rise to the enjoyment of freedom. . . . States are slaves because of either the nature or the misuse of their constitutions; a people is therefore enslaved when the government, by its nature or its vices, infringes on and usurps the rights of the citizen or subject. Applying these principles, we find that America was denied not only its freedom but even an active and effective tyranny. . . . We have been harassed by a conduct which has not only deprived us of our rights but has kept us in a sort of permanent infancy with regard to public affairs. --Simon Bolivar, Jamaica Letter, 1815 What event in the period from 1450 to 1750 created the conditions that Simon Bolivar discussed in the passage?

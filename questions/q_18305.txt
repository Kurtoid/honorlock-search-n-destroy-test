On the map of North America below, identify the air mass associated with the source region for each number listed just above the map. Write the name of the air mass. You can indicate the two-letter symbol as well (not required), but the name is required. NOTE: You will see this map for four (4) questions in a row. For each question, you only need to identify ONE (1) air mass - you do NOT need to identify them for all eight numbers. The number for which this question is asking is in RED just above the map and just below these instructions. Each is worth 0.5 points. It is designed this way so that Canvas can select four random numbers for each student, and you can still see the map for each question. You do NOT have to read these instructions again for each question; they are the same for each, so please do not waste your exam time re-reading them unless you need to.   For this question, identify the air mass at the source region at location 2.

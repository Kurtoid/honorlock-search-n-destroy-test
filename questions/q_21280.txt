Head in the Clouds   Giraffes are the tallest animals on land. An adult giraffe has a neck that exceeds 2 m in length. This neck enables a giraffe to access food that other animals cannot reach and detect predators from a long distance. Studies have shown that giraffes will browse trees at heights that other herbivores cannot reach. The water and nutrients gained from leaves enhance a giraffe's fitness by increasing survival and reproduction. However, a long neck comes with a cost: the heart must spend more energy to pump blood to the brain. If a giraffe's neck were too long, the energy required to circulate blood would exceed the energy gained from eating leaves.        Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 1-5.       1. In a population of giraffes, the average length of the neck is under directional selection.

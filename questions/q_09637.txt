(i) What are the major diameter, pitch and threads per inch for the screw thread?      Major dia = [majDia]       Pitch = [pitch]      Threads per inch = [thrPerInch] (ii) What is the perpendicularity tolerance between the screw thread and the datum A?       Perpendicularity tolerance = [perpTol] (iii) What is the maximum allowed thickness of the disc-like feature whose nominal thickness is 1.00?       Maximum Thickness = [maxThick] (iv) What is the flatness tolerance of the face labeled as datum B?        Flatness tolerance = [FlatTol] (v)  What is the maximum radius of the fillets?         Max radius = [maxRad] (vi) For a manufactured part, what is the maximum possible allowable distance between the centers of the two holes labeled H1 and H2?       Max distance= [maxDist] (vii) If the measured diameter of the hole H1 is 0.502", what is the applicable position tolerance?       Position tolerance = [posTol]

A local hardware store claims that the mean waiting time in line is less than 3.5 minutes. A random sample of 20 customers has a mean of 3.2 minutes with a standard deviation of 0.8 minute. If a = 0.10, test the store's claim. H0:  = 3.5 Ha:  [response1]  Test statistic: [response2] p-Value = [response3] Decision: [response4] Conclusion: There is [response5] sufficient evidence to make the conclusion that the mean waiting time at this hardware store is less than 3.5 minutes.
A student measures the density of a metal. They perform three trials, and calculates three results: 13.6 g/mL, 11.9 g/mL, and 14.1 g/mL (average = 13.2 g/mL). The true density of the metal is 13.4 g/mL. This student's measurements are:[meas] This student's measurements contain primarily:[err]

A new breed of cattle called the Beefers has been discovered in Europe and an effort to bring them to the U.S. has been halted because of certain livestock diseases that are found in that country. A producer has decided to create the breed by purchasing semen and trying to develop the breed through grading up. The objective is to create animals that can be registered as purebreds with a new breed association. Indicate which animals are considered foundation animals and which can be registered. Use the following chart to show how this producer can perform this task. Assume the following:    One of the problems that you have in this breed development is that the females that you are using are homozygous for spots (SS) and you don't want the Beefers breed (ss) to have this gene in the population. You have learned that the gene for spots is dominant (S_). The only females you have to use are homozygous Spot females. Assume 100% conception each breeding, and you will get 50% males and 50% females exactly. Use as many females as possible in each mating. 200 Spot females (SS) will be used to start the process.        Sire Breed makeup and Genotype   # of Females, Breed makeup and Genotype   # of Female Progeny, Breed makeup and Genotype     Breed makeup = Genotype =   # of females = Breed makeup = Genotype =   # female progeny = Breed makeup = Genotype =     Breed makeup = Genotype =   # of females = Breed makeup = Genotype =   # female progeny = Breed makeup = Genotype =     Breed makeup = Genotype =   # of females = Breed makeup = Genotype =   # female progeny = Breed makeup = Genotype =     Breed makeup = Genotype =   # of females = Breed makeup = Genotype =   # female progeny = Breed makeup = Genotype =     Breed makeup = Genotype =   # of females = Breed makeup = Genotype =   # female progeny = Breed makeup = Genotype =     Breed makeup = Genotype =   # of females = Breed makeup = Genotype =   # female progeny = Breed makeup = Genotype =     Breed makeup = Genotype =   # of females = Breed makeup = Genotype =   # female progeny = Breed makeup = Genotype =

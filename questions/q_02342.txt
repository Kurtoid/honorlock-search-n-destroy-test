The Freundlich isotherm for adsorption of xylene for activated carbon is as follows: q = 51.3 Cf 0.204 where,              q = mg of xylene adsorbed/g of carbon Cf = aqueous equilibrium concentration of xylene It is desired to reduce xylene concentration from 200 mg/L to 10 mg/L. You are asked to design a batch system to treat a flow 1000 L/day of solution containing 200 mg/L of xylene.   The value of q (in mg xylene/g carbon) is most nearly: ( 1 m3 = 1000 L)

Briefly describe how a superantigen from S. aureus can cause a strong immune response?
Refer to Figure D, which gives the marginal cost of pollution clean-up for a four-firm economy. So for example, for Firm A to reduce pollution by the first unit would require it spends $50, for the second unit $100, the third $150, and for the fourth unit it would require $250 and that it had already reduced pollution by the first three units (spending $300 to clean up the first three units).  Select the most efficient pollution clean-up policy from among the choices listed.
Use your calculator to solve the given system of equations. In your written work, you should show the matrix you entered into your calculator and the matrix you got for an answer in reduced row echelon form. Then interpret your answer.  If there is one unique solution, state the solution as an ordered n-tuple, i.e. (x, y, z, w, ...). If there are an infinite number of solutions, write your answer in terms of arbitrary variables. If there is no solution, state "No Solution".        x    +  y   +5z  =1           y   +2z   +  w =1       x   +3y   +7z   +2w =2       x   +  y   +5z   +  w =1

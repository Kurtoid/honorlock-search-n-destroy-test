3-kg of water executes a Carnot heat engine cycle in a piston-cylinder device in the saturated liquid-vapor mixture region. The water is heated at 190oC to change from a saturated liquid (State 1) to a saturated vapor (State 2) during the reversible isothermal expansion process.  Next the saturated vapor expands adiabatically to State 3 with a temperature of 35oC and a quality of 80% followed by a reversible isothermal compression process to reach State 4.   Sketch the cycle on a P-v diagram with the saturation curve shown. Please clearly label each of the 4 states, and indicates the heat transfer terms involved in the cycle.  Determine the thermal efficiency of this Carnot heat engine cycle. Determine the heat transfer and work output during the reversible isothermal expansion process from State 1 to State 2, in kJ.  Determine the amount of heat transfer during the reversible isothermal compression process from State 3 to State 4, in kJ.  Determine the net work output from the cycle, in kJ.   Please do NOT type.  Please write your detailed solutions on the exam paper.  Thank you.

Martisa is a professor and BCBA-D, who agrees to serve as a committee member for Danae's master's comprehensive exam. At the beginning of her defense, Danae hands each of her committee members a gift bag to thank them for grading the written portion of her exam, prior to the oral defense, "regardless of the outcome." She explains that in her home country, it is customary to bring gifts to professors as a sign of respect. Martisa whispers to her colleague, "I can't accept this, since it's a violation of my code of ethics." Her colleague replies, "Just keep it please, giving gifts is an important part of her culture. Refusing the gift would be extremely offensive to her." What should Martisa do, according to the BACB Code of Ethics?

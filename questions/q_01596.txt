Lee Home Improvement Company installs replacement siding, windows, and louvered glass doors for single-family homes and condominium complexes. The company is in the process of preparing its annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. Andrea Spain, controller for Lee, has gathered the following data concerning inventory. At May 31, 2020, the balance in Lee's Raw Materials Inventory account was $390,456, and Allowance to Reduce Inventory to Market had a credit balance of $18,900. Spain summarized the relevant inventory cost and market data at May 31, 2020, in the schedule below.

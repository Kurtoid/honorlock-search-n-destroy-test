INSTRUCTIONS: Look at the underlined clause. Write Main if it is the main clause and Dependent if it is the dependent clause.   Ex: She won't be late if she leaves now.     Dependent         I will go away this weekend if I can find someone to watch the dog.
A nurse in a rehabilitation center is planning care for a newly admitted client who has a history of alcohol use disorder. Which of the following client goals is the highest priority?
_________ channels open or close in response to physical distortion of the membrane surface
When specifying materials, the word "specification" is always used.
The driving force for water intake is ________.
The skills, abilities, education and experience needed to perform a job is known as what?
What is the total number of species, the variability of their genes, and the ecosystems in which they live
Which of the following statements is true regarding the type of folds that form from neutral-surface and flexural slip folds?
The following questions are taken from your vocabulary sheets. This term refers to the upper class or nobility of Rome.
The nurse is assessing a newly admitted client and notes capillary refill greater than 3 seconds. What is the nurse's priority action?

Geometrically necessary dislocation is the important concept in strain hardening. (a) (10 pts) In your own words, please explain the difference between statistically stored dislocations and geometrically necessary dislocations. Please be brief. (b) (10 pts) In polycrystalline material, the grains were confined by other grains, as shown in the figure. Please use geometrically necessary dislocation to explain why the deformation along boundaries does not produce void formation along grain boundary, leading to grain disassembly. Please be brief.    (c) (10 pts) Nanoindentation is the technique to evaluate material's hardness by indenting a diamond tip on metal surface.  Geometrically necessary dislocation also forms during nanoindentation, as shown in the schematic below (It is just a drawing I got from Wiki.  The dislocation does not need to be arranged like this).  Please explain: (c-1) how can geometrically necessary dislocation affect your indentation hardness measurement result? (c-2) If you conduct the nanoindentation on both FCC polycrystalline material and single crystal material with slip plane parallel to the indentation direction (illustrated below), which material will be affected the most by the geometrically necessary dislocation.
In accordance with Pascal's principle, to multiply an applied force while using a simple hydraulic lift, your force should be applied to the
Work: A force  F(x,y) = 12 N i- 10 N  j  acts on an object. How much work does this force do as the object moves from the origin to the point r(x,y) = 13m i + 11m j.

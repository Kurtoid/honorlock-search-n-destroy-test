Timber companies around the world plant and manage forests to provide timber for human use. An environmental benefit of these managed forests is that they sequester carbon in the biomass of the trees, which decreases the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, at least over a relatively short time span. The graph below shows the results of a computer simulation that predicts the amount of carbon sequestration in two different managed forests (both with the same number of trees and covering the same surface area) composed of two different tree species over a 140-year period.  (a) Describe the pattern in carbon sequestration for the black locust forest from 2010 to 2050 on the graph. (b) There are three major declines in the carbon sequestered in the black locust forest on the graph. Explain the most likely reason for these declines. (c) Identify one ecological benefit, other than providing habitat, that is provided by forests. (d) Identify one economic benefit that is provided by forests.

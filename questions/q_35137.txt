I have read the following JSCC policy statement: Jackson State Community College is committed to open and insightful dialogue in its courses. Diversity has many manifestations, including diversity of thought, opinion, and values. We encourage all learners to be polite and respectful of that diversity and to refrain from inappropriate or offensive commentary. If inappropriate or offensive content is either emailed or posted on the class site, the teacher may recommend college disciplinary action. Students guilty of academic misconduct, either directly or indirectly through participation or assistance, are subject to disciplinary action through the regular procedures of the student's home institution. Learners as well as faculty should be guided by common sense and basic etiquette. Criticism should be presented in a positive light. The following are good guidelines to follow:  Never post harassing, threatening, or embarrassing comments. Never post content that is harmful, abusive; racially ethnically, or religiously offensive, vulgar; sexually explicit; or otherwise potentially offensive. Never post, transmit, promote, or distribute content that is known to be illegal. If you disagree with someone, respectfully respond to the subject, not the person.  Remember that "tone" can usually be detected accurately in verbal communication, but often can be misunderstood in electronic communication. Because of this phenomenon, we encourage you to err on the side of politeness.

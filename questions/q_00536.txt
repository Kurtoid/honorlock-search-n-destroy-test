[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).] A spring gun launches a 0.010-kg ball to a vertical height of 12 m (as measured from the ball's location when it is against the compressed spring), while air resistance does 0.500 J of work on the ball.  If the spring was compressed 8.0 cm from its relaxed state before the spring gun was fired, what is the spring constant? a. Draw a diagram of the situation, clearly indicating your initial state (i), your final state (f) and the height at which the gravitational potential energy is zero (PEg=0).  b. Draw an energy bar chart to represent this scenario using the initial and final states you defined in part a. c. Determine the spring constant.   [Enter your answer for part c below and upload your work for all parts immediately following the exam]

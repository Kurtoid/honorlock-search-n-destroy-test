Adam is 20-year-old college student, who has come into the campus health clinic. You are the nurse who is admitting Adam and doing his initial examination. He very embarrassingly tells you about his symptoms. For several days, it has been painful to urinate. He has noticed a slight yellow discharge from his urethra that persists throughout the day, whether or not he is urinating. He admits to having unprotected sex regularly, and is concerned that he may have contracted a sexually transmitted infection. Per the doctor's orders, you run a Gram stain of his urethral discharge and discover he has gonorrhea. Based on Adam's clinical presentation and history alone, how could you have distinguished gonorrhea from chlamydia?

Problem 2 Counters count clock cycles ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner.  The tool bar has indent functions.  This is a generic counter design, of course there are other ways to make a counter (may require some modification for this problem). Make a counter module that counts from 0 up to MaxCnt and then goes back to 0 and continues to count. You will need clk, reset inputs, and outputs the current count, and carry which is True when count == MaxCnt. Use a parameter Size to set the size of array count and the output of the MUX. Use a default parameter Size of 5. Use System Verilog, always_ff, and always_comb, and don't use reg datatype. (hint: see cheat sheet) A) First write a 2:1 multiplexer module (use parameter Size to set the width of inputs X, Y, Sel, and output F. B) Write a D flipflop register (REG in the figure above) to hold the current count. Use parameter Size to set the width of D, and Q. Don't bother with output Q'. C) Write a module instantiating the multiplexer, and register with additional components/logic necessary to count 0-MaxCnt and then go back to 0 and continue counting back to MaxCnt ... and so on. Use parameter Size to set the width of Count, and MaxCnt. Don't forget the carry output, not shown in the figure. The carry should be 1 when Count is reset to 0. Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables. Do not use compiler directives. ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate

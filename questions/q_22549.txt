High bone density (unbreakable bones) is coded by a dominant allele(H), while normal bone density is coded by a recessive allele (h) at a particular gene in chromosome 11. Adermatoglyphia (no fingerprints) is coded by a dominant allele (A) and normal fingerprints is coded by a recessive allele (a) at a gene in chromosome 4. Would bone density and adermatoglyphia follow Mendel's principle of independent assortment?

SPSS is to be used to construct a multiple regression model for a data set with two independent variables (x1 and x2) and dependent variable y. Before analyzing the model, diagnostics were generated to check underlying assumptions. Use the SPSS output provided below to check the appropriate assumption.           The variance inflation factor (VIF) is one statistic that can be used to check for [a1]. In general, it is desirable for each VIF to be [a2].

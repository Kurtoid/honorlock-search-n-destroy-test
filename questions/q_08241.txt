Read the following scenario and answer the question below. Many biologists and environmental educators are interested in maintaining biodiversity in urban landscapes, where preserves or reserves are scarce unless land has been set aside for them in urban planning. Nonetheless, they have discovered that making even small changes in commercial and residential landscaping can help promote biodiversity. Some of the changes that have been successful include using native species for street trees and for decorative landscaping, reducing pesticide use on lawns and gardens, and reducing fertilizer use through composting and mulching. Also, managers of schools, larger businesses, and residences are encouraged to increase habitat diversity by creating "landscape islands" that include larger trees surrounded by shrubs and herbaceous plants. Landscape islands ideally should include native species, mixed with exotic ornamentals at the discretion of the land owners. In addition to the butterfly project, you decide to stop spraying the pesticides that control lawn pests. Over the next year, you notice that the lawn grass doesn't grow as well and that many other species of native plants colonize the lawn. This will result in all of the following, EXCEPT ________.

A law professor who was licensed to practice law in State received a letter from the State Bar about a student who had been the professor's research assistant. The letter included questions about fitness to practice and knowledge about the student's violations of the law. The professor did possess information that was asked by the state bar questions, but chose not to disclose it because he thought the state bar did not have a right to ask such questions. Instead, the professor stated, "I have no affirmative knowledge about such information" when the question called for incriminating information about the student.

The pain is crampy in nature and occurs mostly in the lower abdomen.  The pain does not change with eating but improves somewhat after a bowel movement. Her pain is frequently associated with diarrhea, especially when she is under stress, or with intermittent constipation, although on most days she has normal bowel movements.  She has not noted blood or mucus in her stools.  The patient reports a 3.6-kg (8-lb) unintentional weight loss over the past year. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and she takes no medications. On physical examination, she appears thin but otherwise well. Temperature is 98.4degF, blood pressure is 114/53 mm Hg, pulse rate is 70/min, and respiration rate is 12/min.  BMI is 18. The abdomen is diffusely tender to light and deep palpation. There are no detectable abdominal masses, and the liver margins appear normal. The remainder of the examination is normal. Laboratory studies are significant for a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL (normal, 12-16 g/dL), a leukocyte count of 4000/uL (normal, 4,000-10,000/mL), and a platelet count of 148,000/uL (normal, 150,000-450,000/mL). 13.

Louis Pasteur famously helped disprove the theory of spontaneous generation with his "swan neck flask" experiments. In his experiments, he used sugar or yeast extracts, and following boiling and despite being open to the air via the "swan neck" of the flask, his broths remained sterile. However, some of his contemporaries who attempted to reproduce his work instead used hay infusions (i.e., hay boiled in water to make a tea), and their solutions did not remain sterile. What would likely have happened if Pasteur himself had used hay infusions instead of sugar or yeast extracts in his experiments?

Read the following paragraph, which is an opinion written by a woman from Honduras.  Then respond to the true or false question at the bottom.    Desde mi punto de vista, hay tanta1 variedad que es imposible generalizar el concepto de "familia hispana". Ademas2, con la globalizacion, la movilidad y los cambios culturales durante los ultimos3 anos, la palabra familia es muy dinamica. Primero, tenemos que pensar en la migracion, especialmente en los paises centroamericanos por razones economicas y politicas. En mi pais, Honduras, es comun que los padres y los hijos mayores tienen que dejar4 a sus familias y buscar trabajo para poder mandarles dinero. Las mujeres, como mi mama y yo, tenemos que trabajar para mantener a los ninos mas pequenos. Pero tenemos el apoyo5 familiar de mis tios y de mis abuelos para mantener la unidad familiar. Segundo, hoy dia hay mas oportunidades para la mujer de recibir una buena educacion y por eso el indice de natalidad6 ha disminuido7 de mas de cuatro hijos por mujer a solo tres. Asi que la idea del nucleo familiar con madre, padre e hijos no es universal y es imposible decir que hay un solo modelo.

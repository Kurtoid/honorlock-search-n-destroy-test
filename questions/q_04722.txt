A group of students has been trained to increase their score on the math segment of the S.A.T.  For the general population, S.A.T.-Math scores have the normal distribution with u=505 and s=105. It is reasonable to assume that the shape of the distribution is unchanged by training effects, but is shifted, hopefully to the right. It follows that we assume that s =105. For a random sample, of size n=25 the sample mean (sM) S.A.T.-math score is 559.  Compute a 99% confidence interval for, the mean score of the population of trained students Also find the correct sample size n in order to estimate  with a margin of error M=12, with 99%  confidence where s =105. ( Round up to the next highest whole number) Your answer is in form of a double  (Lower Limit C. I., Upper Limit C.I.) C. I. is confidence interval.

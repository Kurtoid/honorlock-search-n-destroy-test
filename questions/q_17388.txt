Three different experiments are made by physics students by colliding a blue and a red object on a frictionless horizontal table. The objects move along the x-axis. The velocities before (subscript "i") and after (subscript "f") that the students claim to have masured are shown in the diagram. All blue objects have a mass of 5.00 kg, and all red objects have a mass of 3.00 kg, but they are not necessarily identical. (The blue object in experiment A could be made of a different material as the blue object in experiment B, etc.) What can you say about these three collisions?

Up to 10 points per paragraph answer (partial credit for partial answers). For this section, write as directed about ONLY FOUR (4) of the following eight passages. Earn up to 10 points for each paragraph answer (partial credit for partial answers).  For the four passages you select, identify each by title/author. Then, in 4-5-sentence paragraph answers, shed some light on the passage, by 1) describing in some detail what's going on in the passage, and 2) discussing in some detail its significance to the whole of the work it comes from--and, perhaps, some background on the historical / cultural context (to the extent that we went over that in class).  Be specific and thorough.  As above, type all four of your answers in the text box below. Clearly label each paragraph answer by beginning with the selection number, as I've done below. (Please DON'T retype the original paragraph!)   #1      LINDNER: {Coming to the table with efficiency, putting his briefcase on the table and starting to unfold papers and unscrew fountain pens.] Well, I certainly was glad to hear from you people. [WALTER has begun the trek out of the room, slowly and awkwardly, rather like a small boy, passing the back of his sleeve across his mouth from time to time.] Life can really be so much simpler than people let it be most of the time. Well--with whom do I negotiate? You, Mrs. Younger, or your son here? [MAMA sits with her hands folded on her lap and her eyes closed as WALTER advances. TRAVIS goes close to LINDNER and looks at the papers curiously.] Just some official papers, sonny. RUTH: Travis, you go downstairs. MAMA: [Opening her eyes and looking into WALTER's] No, Travis, you stay right here. And you make him understand what you doing, Walter Lee. You teach him good. Like Willy Harris taught you. You show where our five generations done come to. Go ahead, son--.   #2        MRS. HALE: She liked the bird. She was going to bury it in that pretty box. MRS. PETERS: (in a whisper) When I was a girl-my kitten-there was a boy took a hatchet, and before my eyes-and before I could get there--(Covers her face an instant.). lf they hadn't held me back I would have-(catches herself, looks upstairs where steps are heard, falters weakly)-hurt him. MRS. HALE: (with a slow look around her) I wonder how it would seem never to have had any children around. (Pause.) No, Wright wouldn't like the bird-a thing that sang. She used to sing. He killed that. too. MRS. PETERS: (moving uneasily) We don't know who killed the bird. MRS. HALE: I knew John Wright. , MRS. PETERS: It was an awful thing was done in this house that night, Mrs. Hale. Killing a man while he slept, slipping a rope around his neck that choked the life out of him. MRS. HALE: His neck. Choked the life out of him. (Her hand goes out and rests on the bird-cage.) MRS. PETERS: (with rising voice) We don't know who killed him. We don't know.   #3                          "'It's really an awfully simple operation, Jig," the man said. "It's not really an operation at all.' The girl looked at the ground the table legs rested on. 'I know you wouldn't mind it, Jig. It's really not anything. It's just to let the air in.' The girl did not say anything. 'I'll go with you and I'll stay with you all the time. They just let the air in and then it's all perfectly natural.' 'Then what will we do afterward?" 'We'll be fine afterward. Just like we were before.'   #4          So on we worked, and waited for the light And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;   #5          The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.   #6 The girlchild was born as usual and presented dolls that did pee-pee and miniature GE stoves and irons  and wee lipsticks the color of cherry candy. Then in the magic of puberty, a classmate said: You have a great big nose and fat legs.    #7 He worked slowly and carefully, keenly aware of his danger. Gradually, as the flame grew stronger, he increased the size of the twigs with which he fed it. He squatted in the snow, pulling the twigs out from their entanglement in the brush and feeding directly to the flame. He knew there must be no failure. When it is seventy-five below zero, a man must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire--that is, if his feet are wet. If his feet are dry, and he fails, he can run along the trail for half a mile and restore his circulation. But the circulation of wet and  freezing feet cannot be restored by running when it is seventy-five below zero. No matter how fast he runs, the wet feet will freeze the harder.    #8 When the stars threw down their spears, And water'd Heaven with their tears, Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

A Case study: Charles developed type 2 diabetes over 10 years ago. Recently, a scratch on his foot does not seem to be healing. His open sore, or ulcer, is the result of a diabetic foot. When he was finally seen by his physician, Charles was rushed to the operating room. His open sore, or ulcer, is the result of a diabetic foot. The concern here is that gas gangrene may have taken hold in the dead tissue. The most likely agent of gas gangrene is Clostridium perfringens, an endospore-forming, mesophilic, neutrophilic, gram-positive bacterium that secretes hemolytic enzymes. It is an obligate anaerobe that grows in tissue devoid of oxygen. Since dead tissue is no longer supplied with oxygen by the circulatory system, the dead tissue provides pockets of ideal environment for the growth of C. perfringens. Which growth conditions would you recommend for the detection of C. perfringens?

You examine dishes of tobacco seedlings, noting seedling color.   Each dish represents offspring from a single genetic cross.  You know that there is a single genetic trait involved in chlorophyll production that creates the color difference that you are observe.  Use the following designations for the alleles:G = chlorophyll production; green seedling (dominant)g = no chlorophyll production; white seedling (recessive) In one dish you count 56 green seedlings and 44 white seedlings.

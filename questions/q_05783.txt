Build the series parallel circuit shows below.         Calculate and Measure the total resistance and total current and record the data in table 1      Total resistance calculated by series parallel transformation (Ohms)         Resistance Measured using multimeter. (ohms)         Compute the total resistance using ohms law R= V/I (ohms)         Calculate the total current using ohms law (It) = V/Rt (mA)         Measure the total current (It) (mA)                                                                       Table 1    Measure the voltage across R1 through R8 and record the data in table 2 Measure the current through R1 through R8 and record the data in table 2      Resistor   Voltage (v)   Current (mA)     R1             R2             R3             R4             R5             R6             R7             R8                                                                                   Table 2  Open R3 resistor from one end and then measure the total current It=________mA. Did the total current shows in the table 1 change? If so, explain the concept. Put R3 back in the circuit and open the end of R4 and then measure the total current again, It=_______mA. Did the total current shows in the table 1 changes? Explain the concept.

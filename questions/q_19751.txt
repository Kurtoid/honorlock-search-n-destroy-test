Questions -Child P: SCR-Child-P-Overview-Report-Published-March-.16-1-1.pdf  'Between January and October 2015 East Sussex Safeguarding Children Board conducted a Serious Case Review about a young child, referred to in this report as Child P, who was killed by her father. Child P and other members of her family moved to East Sussex in 2011 when the mother left the father. There had been a history of domestic violence and abuse over a period of some five years.'   'This Serious Case Review deals with dramatic and tragic events that have been widely reported in the media and may continue to be of public interest. In deciding what to publish I have been mindful of the right of surviving members to a private and family life and have sought to balance this against the need for openness, accountability and learning. It is my sincere wish that the publication of this report will not trigger any further intrusion into the lives of surviving family members and friends of Child P.'

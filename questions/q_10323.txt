You are the owner of a company that produces nuclear-powered motors, generators, and power boosters.  A prototype of a product which will increase the power and submarine speed on a Trident-class nuclear submarine by 32%, while making the boat run 8% quieter, with a 220% lower probability of malfunction has just been successfully tested by your engineers.  However, your application for a patent is caught in red tape and you have been advised that your chances of getting a patent on this product are "about 50-50."  Your major competition is known to be only weeks behind you in producing a similar product.                                     You must construct a new facility capable of mass-producing this product since a facility of much higher quality than your current facility is required for executing Department of Defense (DOD) contracts.  The DOD has told you that they are very interested in your system, and would like to test them immediately, and if the tests are successful, would like to purchase a system for all of the Navy's current nuclear submarines, and make it a part of future submarine construction.                                                                                                                Since this is to be your facility, and the product to be produced here is so highly technical, your need is for extremely high-quality construction.  You understand that because of the highly technical and delicate nature of some parts of this construction that there are only three or four contractors in the world capable of building certain parts of this facility.  You are an inexperienced owner.  What type of delivery system / contractor procurement strategy would be the best choice for the project?   You are NOT required to generate a matrix.
A researcher would like to evaluate the effect of a new reading program for second-grade students. She has half of the second-grade students use the new reading program for the first half of the school year and use the current reading program for the second half of the year. The other half of the second-grade students use the current reading program for the first half of the school year and use the new reading program for the second half of the year. The researcher plans to use the data from this study to test whether the new program had a significant effect on reading scores. Which of the following hypothesis tests would be appropriate?

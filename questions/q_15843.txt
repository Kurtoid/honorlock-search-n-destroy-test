Aspartame is an artificial sweeter that chemically is comprised of two amino acids bound through an amide bond. Conformational analysis of aspartame has provided insight into the biological receptors that allow humans to perceive bitterness and sweetness. Answer the questions below about the various conformers of aspartame.  The conformation of aspartame (through the C1-C2 bond) that provided insight into the receptors responsible for sweetness was that wherein the dihedral angle between the "Ph" group and the "NHAsp" group was 180deg. Which of the Newman structures below represents this conformation? [180deg] The conformation of aspartame (through the C1-C2 bond) that provided insight into the receptors responsible for bitterness was that wherein the dihedral angle between the "Ph" group and the "NHAsp" group was 0deg. Which of the Newman structures below represents this conformation? [0deg] Which Newman structure of aspartame (through the C1-C2 bond) shown below shows the molecule in its lowest energy conformation (assume "NHAsp" is larger than CO2CH3)?  [lowestE] Which Newman structure of aspartame (through the C1-C2 bond) shown below shows the molecule in its highest energy conformation (assume "NHAsp" is larger than CO2CH3)? [highestE] What is the relationship between structures B and E below? [relationship]

"I have heard that the smoking of opium is very strictly forbidden by your country; that is because the harm caused by opium is clearly understood. Since it is not permitted to do harm to your own country, then even less should you let it be passed on the harm of other countries- how much less to China! Of all that China exports to foreign countries, there is not a single thing which is not beneficial to the people...On the other hand, articles coming from the outside of China, what difficulty would there be if we closed the frontier and stopped the trade?... The goods from China carried away by your country not only supply your own consumption and use, but can also be divided up and sold to other countries, producing a triple profit,"  -Lin Zexu, Qing scholar-official in a letter to Queen Victoria of England, 1839 The views expressed in the passage are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Qing society?

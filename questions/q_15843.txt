A block of mass M is on a table with no friction acting. It has a horizontal rope attached that goes over a pulley and a block of mass m hangs from it. It is found that the subsequent acceleration of the blocks is "a", with of course the block M accelerating horizontally and m accelerating vertically. If you instead pull the rope down with your hand (that is replacing the mass m with a force F down), what value of F would you need to get M to accelerate with the same value "a"?

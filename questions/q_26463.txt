1. (20 points total): In preparing for a picnic (socially-distanced, of course!), the host of the event puts some old-style glass Coca-Cola bottles at 25*C into a large washtub full of ice water at 0*C. We are interested in the temperature of the Coca-Cola inside the bottles over time. The bottles remain submerged in the ice water. In generating your model, assume that the bottle is isothermal but include its ability to store energy. Also assume that the Coca-Cola inside the bottle is isothermal, but that you also need to include its ability to store energy.
100 mL of a solution with a TOC (total organic carbon) concentration of 0.5% is placed in each of the five containers with activated carbon and shaken for 48 hours. The samples are filtered and the concentration of TOC measured, yielding the following analyses:   Test beaker no.:          1          2           3            4             5 Carbon (grams):        10        8           6            4             2 TOC (mg/L):               42        53         85        129      267   The Freundlich isotherm is to be used:  X/M = k Cf 1/n The value of X (TOC removed) in the 1st beaker is (mg):

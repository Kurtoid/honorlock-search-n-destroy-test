How are profits and losses measured? Suppose a competitive market is in a situation such that each seller is making a positive economic profit. Describe in detail what you would expect to happen in this market over the long run. Next suppose a competitive market is in a situation such that each seller is making an economic loss. Describe in detail what you would expect to happen in this market over the long run. Be sure to include predictions for the number of sellers, equilibrium price of the product, and level of economic profit in your answers.

Which of the following statements best describes what the following statement does?   ted.left(45)
Nicole is socially inhibited and oversensitive to negative evaluation. She was thinking about a career in nursing, but she changed her mind because she believes the doctors would criticize her and patients would reject her. She has never been on a date because she feels socially inept and unappealing; she avoids meeting new people because anything less than immediate, unconditional acceptance causes her anxiety. Just yesterday she was invited to go on a kayak trip, but she didn't go because she was worried she would embarrass herself. Which of the following diagnoses accounts for Nicole's personality?

Aspartame is an artificial sweeter that chemically is comprised of two amino acids bound through an amide bond. Conformational analysis of aspartame has provided insight into the biological receptors that allow humans to perceive bitterness and sweetness. Answer the questions below about the various conformers of aspartame.  The conformation of aspartame (through the C1-C2 bond) that provided insight into the receptors responsible for bitterness was that wherein the dihedral angle between the "Ph" group and the "NHAsp" group was 0deg. Which of the Newman structures below represents this conformation? [0deg] The conformation of aspartame (through the C1-C2 bond) that provided insight into the receptors responsible for sweetness was that wherein the dihedral angle between the "Ph" group and the "NHAsp" group was 180deg. Which of the Newman structures below represents this conformation? [180deg] Which Newman structure of aspartame (through the C1-C2 bond) shown below shows the molecule in its highest energy conformation (assume "NHAsp" is larger than CO2CH3)? [highestE] Which Newman structure of aspartame (through the C1-C2 bond) shown below shows the molecule in its lowest energy conformation (assume "NHAsp" is larger than CO2CH3)? [lowestE] What is the relationship between structures B and E below? [relationship]
Which best describes the use of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) in chronic pain situations?
A two-stage, high-rate trickling filters treat 2.25 MGD of municipal wastewater that has a BOD5 of 210 mg/L. The trickling filters are of equal diameter and depth and have equal recycle ratios. Other pertinent data for the facility are as follows:  BOD5 applied to the trickling filter system: 158 mg/L after 25% of BOD5 removal in the primary clarification system Trickling filter diameter: 75 ft Trickling filter media depth: 6ft Required surface area of the two-stage trickling filter system: 4,418 ft2 (=0.1014 acres) Recycle ratio: 1.0  Using the NRC equations, determine the following parameters and solve the problems.    (5 pts) Determine the required volume of the two-stage trickling filter system (Unit: acreft). (5 pts) Determine organic mass loading to the two-stage trickling filter system (unit: lb BOD5/day). (5 pts) Determine trickling filter recycle factor (F). (5 pts) If the BOD5 removal efficiency of the first-stage trickling filter is 68.4%, determine BOD5 removal efficiency (%) of the second-stage trickling filter. (Hint: V2 unit is acreft)

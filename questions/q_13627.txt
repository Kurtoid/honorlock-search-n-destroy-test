Louis Pasteur described what we now know as the Pasteur Effect. He found that yeast grown in oxygen use less glucose than yeast growing in the absence of oxygen. Further studies of glycolysis showed that yeast grown in the presence of oxygen have decreased levels of some glycolytic intermediates (see chart). Based on these results what enzyme catalyzes the control step in glycolysis?

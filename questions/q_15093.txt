At elevated temperatures, methylisonitrile (CH3NC) isomerizes to acetonitrile (CH3CN):(g) - CH3--CN(g)(rearrangement of the NC)At the start of the experiment, there are 0.200 mol of reactant (CH3NC) and 0 mol of product (CH3CN) in the reaction vessel. After 25 min of reaction, 0.108 mol of reactant (CH3NC) remains. The average rate of decomposition of methyl isonitrile, CH3NC, in this 25 min period is ________ mol/min.

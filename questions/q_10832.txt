Dispatch: You are called to University Center Club for a patient who is 7.5 months pregnant and thinks she is experiencing contractions.   Background Information: Upon arrival, you ensured the scene was safe and donned the appropriate PPE. You introduced yourself to the female who is laying down on a couch in the lounge area and shares that she thinks she started experiencing contractions during dinner 30 minutes ago. So far, you have gathered the following information about your patient - she is alert, she is breathing at a slightly rapid rate, breaths are of adequate depth and appear to be unlabored, and her pulse is present in her radial artery. You don't observe any apparent trauma to the patient. You complete your primary assessment and determine that patient is a low priority based on your assessment that there are currently no existing or potential threats to her ABC's. You determine she is a stable medical patient at this time. Your initial questioning to get more information about the chief complaint reveals that the soon-to-be mom thinks she's had maybe 5-6 contractions in the last 30 min or so, with each contraction lasting anywhere from maybe 30 seconds to a minute. She doesn't think her water has broken, but it's her first pregnancy so she's not sure what to expect really. Your SAMPLE assessment is as follows: S- (summary of the info. above) A- no allergies to medication M- Zofran and an anti-depressant P- depression L- finished her dinner right before the contractions started E- was just eating dinner and as surprised when she started feeling them Additional information: Your secondary assessment reveals that this is the female's first pregnancy ever, her water has not broken, she has not experienced any complications that she knows of, and she regularly sees her OBGYN. The female tells you she thinks she's about to have another contraction.   Q1: Describe how you would assess her contractions and how you would determine whether or not they indicate that birth is potentially imminent. Q2: (General Knowledge) List and describe two of the complications described in the text where your assessment reveals birth is imminent for the pregnant female, but the recommended EMR response is to encourage the female to NOT push or try to have the baby. Please be sure to address generally in 1-2 sentences what the proper EMR care is for each situation.

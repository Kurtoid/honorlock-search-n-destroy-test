Some scientists believe that as global temperatures increase, methane gas will be released from ice pockets in the deep ocean. Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas and will further increase warming, leading to more methane release. This is an example of:
The order states D5W 500 mL plus KCl 20 mEq at 42 mL/h IV. KCl is supplied in a 20-mL ampule containing 55 mEq. How many milliliters of KCl will be added to the 500 mL of D5W? Round to the nearest whole number

Serial ten-fold dilutions are made from a broth culture of Bacillus subtilis in order to determine the number of bacteria in the culture.  Following the dilution series, 0.1 ml of a 1:10,000 (1 x 10-4) dilution is plated, the plate is incubated, and 110 colonies are counted.  Calculate the number of bacteria in the original Bacillus subtilis culture. Don't forget units! Cannot earn full credit without proper units. Make sure your answer reflects proper scientific notation! Use the ^ to denote an exponent, i.e. 1 x 10-4 would be written as 1 x 10^-4.

The patient has a metastatic brain tumor.  The oncologist orders parallel opposed lateral fields of the whole brain to be treated midline on the Varian 21EX with a calibrated isocenter of 100 cm. The field size is 21.25 cm x 15.75 cm and the collimator is rotated 28 degrees counter clockwise for the left lateral to avoid treatment to the eyes. The patient's separation is 16.5 cm. From the following list,  put the procedures in order to complete the patient's treatment. 1. Rotate gantry - Right Lateral (91.75cm) -rotate collimator clockwise 28 degrees2. Set field size and collimator angle3. Level - Isocenter - Read SSD (91.75cm Left Lateral) and treat4. Return gantry and collimator to 0 degrees5. Read SSD and treat

A rigid tank having a volume of 1.0 m3 contains super-heated steam at a pressure of 400 kPa and temperature of 250degC.   Heat is added at constant volume until the pressure doubles.   Assuming there are no other heat or work interactions, find the temperature of the steam (in  oC) after the heating process.

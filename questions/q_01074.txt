Read this paragraph and answer the following question.1Communicating with people who are experiencing grief requires special care. 2A person may experience grief for many reasons, but each situation seems to call for a somewhat different set of dos and don'ts. 3Here are some suggestions for communicating more effectively with the grief- stricken. 4First, confirm the other person and the person's emotions. 5A simple "You must be worried about finding another position" confirms the person's feelings and expresses support. 6Next, give the person permission to grieve. 7Let the person know that it's acceptable and okay with you if he or she grieves in the ways that feel most comfortable--for example, crying or talking about old times. 8Then, encourage the person to express feelings and talk about the loss. 9Most people will welcome this opportunity. 10Finally, let the person know you care and are available. 11Saying you're sorry is a simple but effective way to let the person know you care.--Adapted from DeVito, The Interpersonal Communication Book, 12 ed., p. 175-176.Sentence 4 is a ________.

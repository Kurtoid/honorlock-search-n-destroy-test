Refer to the following fragment of MIPS code:   SW R16,12(R6) LW R16,8(R6) BEQ R5,R4,Label       # Assume R5!=R4 ADD R5,R1,R4 SLT R5,R15,R4   Assume that individual pipeline stages have the following latencies:   IF: 200ps ID: 220ps EX: 150ps MEM: 190ps WB: 100ps   (a) For this problem, assume that all branches are perfectly predicted by the end of the decode stage (this eliminates all control hazards) and that no delay slots are used. If we only have one memory (for both instructions and data), there is a structural hazard every time we need to fetch an instruction in the same cycle in which another instruction accesses data. To guarantee forward progress, this hazard must always be resolved in favor of the instruction that accesses data. What is the total execution time (in cycles) of this instruction sequence in the 5-stage pipeline that only has one memory? Hint: You may need to draw a pipelined execution diagram to estimate the cycles accurately, but you do not need to show that diagram in your answer. (b) For this problem, assume that all branches are perfectly predicted by the end of the decode stage (this eliminates all control hazards) and that no delay slots are used. Also assume that we still have the single memory from (a). Now if we change load/store instructions to use a register (without an offset) as the address, these instructions no longer need to use the ALU. As a result, MEM and EX stages can be overlapped and the pipeline has only 4 stages. Assuming this change in the ISA does not affect clock cycle time, how many cycles does it take to execute this instruction sequence?  (c) Given the pipeline stage latencies, calculate the clock cycle time for (a). (d) In the case of (b), assume that the resulting EX/MEM stage has a latency that is the larger of the original two, plus 20 ps needed for the work that could not be done in parallel. Calculate the clock cycle time in that case.

When Vance purchased a new 4K flat screen TV from Best Buy, he was told by the salesperson that the TV would be delivered to his apartment on Tuesday between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. However, the TV was not delivered until 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday. The late delivery caused Vance to be dissatisfied with Best Buy's delivery service. Vance's dissatisfaction with Best Buy's delivery service resulted from:

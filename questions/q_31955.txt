In Challenge 4, we considered customized shipment sizes to each store when all the stores were the same size. This question considers stores of different sizes. In particular, the company closed 10 stores around the country and opened a Super Store in Miami, FL, 1,200 miles from Indianapolis. The Super Store sells 10 times as much as a typical store, but otherwise has the same characteristics:  Open 300 days/year and, each day it is open, sells  200 TVs 1,000 Tablets and 2,500 Phones   Inventory holding cost % is 30% We pay $2/mile with a 15% fuel surcharge A truck holds up to 40,000 lbs and up to 4,000 cubic feet and travels 500 miles per day.       Flatscreen Tablet Phone   Cost $200 $250 $700   Weight (lbs) 30 1 0.5   Cube (cu ft) 8.5 0.1 0.025   From Austin Indianapolis Denver   Sells For $300 $360 $900    You can download this table in Excel here.

During which of the following situations is it correct to write numbers as numerals?
Read the following scenario to answer the following question(s).Biomedical scientists have recently developed an anticancer drug delivery system that sneaks the anticancer drug into cancer cells before releasing it. They were able to do this by using two sets of liposomes. An anticancer drug (Doxorubicin (Dox)) bound to DNA molecules was added into one set of liposomes, and a high concentration of ATP molecules were added to the other set of liposomes. The drug is inactive when bound to DNA molecules. Researchers inject both types of liposomes into cancer cells, and upon doing so their contents are released. The ATP molecules from one set of liposomes bind to the DNA molecules from the other set of liposomes) and activate the drug, thus inducing cell death and decreasing tumor size.Mice with breast cancer tumors were treated with this liposome system to test the effectiveness of the drug. The scientists performed three trials-one with both types of liposomes (Dox + ATP), one with just the drug (Dox only), and one with a salt solution (control). Examine the figure below and answer the following questions.What is the best explanation for the intermediate tumor size that results from treatment with just the drug (Dox only) compared to the control and treatment with both liposomes (Dox + ATP)?

Code-Writing, Part 2. Please read the code sample below carefully. You may assume all classes are properly imported.  Then read the instructions in the question which follows and write an appropriate code sample. Consider the following main method which calls WriteArray.  WriteArray writes each element of an array of any serializable type to a binary file. WriteArray takes in two parameters and returns a boolean.  The first parameter is the array to be written, the second parameter is the name of the file being written.  It returns true if the write process completes without exception and false otherwise.  WriteArray prints each element's string representation to the console immediately before writing it. public static void main(String[] args){    Integer[] theArray = {999, 18, 123456789, 555, 74, 1, 25, 12345, 9999, 9, 4875};    if (WriteArray(theArray, "outputFile.txt")){        System.out.println("Write successful");    }} As a result of a program run, the file outputFile.txt contains the binary representation of every Integer contained in theArray and the console output would be (assuming a successful write): 999181234567895557412512345999994875Write successful

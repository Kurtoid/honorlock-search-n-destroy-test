1) A 60g skater spins at 0.800 rev/ s with her arms extended. Her rotational inertia is 2.5 kgm2. Then she brings her arms closer to the body and reduces the rotational inertia to 0.35 kgm2, and spins faster. A) Convert 0.800 rev/s to radians per second. (5 points) B) What is the skater's initial angular momentum? (5 points) C) What is her angular velocity in radians per second after she pulls in her arms? (5 points) D) What is her initial rotational kinetic energy? (5 points)     2) An ultra-centrifuge accelerates from rest to 100,000 rpm in 2 minutes. Calculate its angular acceleration in radians/s2.

9.  Do students sleep more in Pennsylvania or in California? A study was designed to estimate the difference in the number of hours students sleep per night and the summary statistics for the following two universities is given below: Penn State University:       n=190       sample mean = 7.17       s = 1.95 University of California, Davis:       n=173       sample mean = 6.83       s = 1.71 Does the data show that the mean number of hours that Penn State University students sleep per night is significantly different from the mean number of hours that University of California, Davis students sleep per night?  (While answering the following sub-parts of this question, you will be including the null and alternative hypothesis, the test statistic, the p-value (a visualization and an interpretation), your statistical decision, and your conclusion in the context of the problem.) (c)  What is the p-value for Step 3 of the hypothesis test?

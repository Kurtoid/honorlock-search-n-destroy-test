Risk Assessment (20pts): An industrial facility that emits benzene into the atmosphere is being proposed for a site near a residential neighborhood. Air quality models predict that 60 percent of the time, prevailing winds will blow away from the neighborhood (i.e., no exposure), but 40 percent of the time the benzene concentration will be 0.01 mg/ m3. Use standard exposure factors: exposure frequency 350 days/ yr (assumed that they are on vacation or away from the area 15 days/yr), exposure duration 30 years, average inhalation 20 m3/day for an adult that weighs 70 kg and will sadly only live to 70 years old. Benzene potency factor (aka slope factor) is 2.9 x 10-2 (kg-day/mg). If the acceptable risk is 10-6, should this plant be allowed to be built? Calculations must be shown; not merely a yes or no answer.

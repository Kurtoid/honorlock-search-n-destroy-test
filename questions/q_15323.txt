30-31) Use the text below to answer questions 30-31 Lionel is a psychologist interested in the relationship between watching lots of ice hockey and visual motion sensitivity (i.e., how well can you visually perceive and track moving objects).  Lionel reasoned that people who watch hockey spend a great deal of time watching a rapidly moving hockey puck. Thus, they might have better visual motion sensitivity.  Lionel randomly recruited a sample of 1000 undergraduates from the University of Wisconsin as participants.  He first asked all the participants to indicate how many hours per week they typically spend watching hockey.  He then had all the participants take a short test of visual motion sensitivity (i.e., how quick of a moving object could the participants track with their eyes).  Lionel found that participants who indicated that they watched more than 3 hours of hockey per week had much better visual motion sensitivity than participants who indicated that they never watched hockey.   30) What type of methodology did Lionel use in his study?

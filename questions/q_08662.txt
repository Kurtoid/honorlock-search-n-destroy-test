A wound specimen was inoculated onto two sheep blood agar plates (SBAP): one plate was incubated aerobically and the other anaerobically.  After 48 hours incubation, colonies which were gram stained as gram-positive rods and were catalase negative were observed on both the aerobic sheep blood agar plate (1+ growth), and the anaerobic sheep blood agar plate (4+ growth).  The technologist subcultured the colony from the anaerobic plate to sheep blood agar incubated aerobically, a sheep blood agar plate incubated in a candle jar and a sheep blood agar plate incubated anaerobically.  Again growth of the same colony was observed on the aerobic SBAP (1+ growth), SBAP in the candle jar growth (2+ growth) and anaerobic SBAP (4+ growth).  At this point which of the following organisms is most likely?

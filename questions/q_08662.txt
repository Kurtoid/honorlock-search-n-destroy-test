QUESTION TWO ( 35 minutes)Based on the facts in Question One, assume further that one of the persons attending theparty, Val Victim, age 20, consumed several drinks at Defendant's party, and then proceeded to drive back into the nearest town, 10 miles away. On the way, Val lost control of her vehicle, ran off the road, and crashed into a tree, sustaining fatal injuries. An autopsy showed that Val's blood alcohol level at the time of the accident was .18, close to double the legal limit. A. Defendant is charged with manslaughter in connection with Val's death. Applying the manslaughter provisions of Anhedonia, in light of the background principles of the common law, is Defendant guilty of manslaughter? Explain. Be sure to evaluate the major arguments that Defendant is likely to raise in attempting to avoid criminal liability. The manslaughter provisions of Anhedonia are contained in section 101 of its criminal code, which provides: MANSLAUGHTER (10 A.S.A. SS101)A person is guilty of manslaughter if, in a criminally negligent manner, he causes the death of another. Criminal negligence is established when the offender's conduct amounts to a gross deviation from the standard of care expected to be maintained by a reasonably prudent person under like circumstances. A killing also constitutes manslaughter when, at the time of the killing, the person kills under the influence of a sudden and intense passion resulting from provocation by the individual killed. (12.5)B. Using the facts from Part A of this Question and of the previous Question, what homicide crime, if any, could Defendant be guilty of committing if, instead of the substantive provisions of Anhedonia law, the Defendant had been subject to the provisions of the Model Penal Code? Explain. (10)C. Assume the existence of the same facts used in Part A of this Question, except that, prior to Val Victim leaving the party, Val was confronted by her sorority sister, Fran Friend, about Val's drinking. Fran, concerned that Val was too intoxicated to drive back to town, resolved in her own mind to give Val a ride. However, Fran later changed her mind after she observed Val flirting with Fran's boyfriend at the party. Fran thought to herself "It would serve that two-timing Val right if she got a DUI or had an accident. She's on her own -- I'm not helping her out this time." Using the manslaughter provisions of Anhedonia, in light of the background principles of the common law, how, if at all, would this affect your analysis of Defendant's manslaughter liability? Could Fran herself be guilty of manslaughter? Explain. (12.5)

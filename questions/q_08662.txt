21)  The 13C-NMR spectrum of phenylacetylene is shown below, with labeled carbons.     A) Which of the following is correct:  (Choose from a-e) [1]        a)  No 1H decoupling was used        b) Off-resonance 1H decoupling was used        c) Broad-band 1H decoupling was used        d) Broad-band 13C decoupling was used        e) Narrow line spin tickling was used B) Why is the peak marked with an asterisk smaller than the peak next to it (on the right)?  (Choose from a-e) [2]        a) Because fewer C2 nuclei are contributing to the signal        b) Because NOE transfers energy from the proton attached to C1, while C2 does not have an attached proton.        c) Because C2 is not magnetically equivalent to C1        d) Because C2 is closer to the aromatic ring and has more deshielding        e) Because the triple bond enhances the inhomogeneities of the magnetic field

A beverage company is about to begin producing and selling a new drink. They have two potential recipes and need to determine which one will be more popular among consumers: Drink A or Drink B. They plan to execute an experiment comparing consumers' ratings of each drink, but they need your help with the design. a. Briefly describe a research design that would require an independent-samples t-test to analyze the data. b. The test results are as follows: t(58) = 4.32, p < .05, r2 = .25. Using the names of the independent and dependent variables in this study, interpret the effect size.

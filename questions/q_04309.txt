The IRR is defined as:
A chemist was uncertain whether a particular chiral substrate was undergoing substitution with the iodide ion as the nucleophile by the SN2 or SN1 mechanism.  They performed a series of experiments and amassed the following data:  When the nucleophile was changed to bromide ion (Br-) the rate of reaction was unchanged. The product of the reaction with iodide ion resulted in a mixture of enantiomers. When the solvent was changed from acetone (CH3COCH3) to methanol, the rate increased 1000 times. When the concentration of this substrate was doubled, the rate also doubled.   Address the following questions in the text entry box. A.  Which mechanism is this reaction following? B.  Explain how each piece of data supplied supports your decision. C.  Why didn't the chemist experiment with changing the leaving group?

1) Some people have high hospital anxiety, and are afraid before surgery. People who are already in hospital the night before an operation are usually given a sedative to help them relax and reduce anxiety. Researchers want to perform a statistical analysis to determine whether the sedative affects blood pressure.

The data are as follows:       Person   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10     Before:   135   138   149   134   116   129   128   132   119   112     After:   121   137   140   122   107   126   122   124   115   110       Calculate the mean value of the ten "before" systolic blood pressure readings

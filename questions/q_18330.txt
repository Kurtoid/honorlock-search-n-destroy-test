1.   An oil tank with a 90-ft diameter circular foundation is to be constructed at a site with a soil profile shown below. The oil tank when filled to capacity would cause a uniform pressure q=1000 lb/ft2 at the foundation level (which for simplicity is assumed at the ground surface). In other words, there is a circular loading applied to the soil mass at the ground surface.(a)    Calculate the maximum consolidation settlement of the clay layer caused by this uniform loading of q=1000 lb/ft2 at the middle of the clay layer. (b)    Determine how long (in days) it will take for a settlement of 3 in. to occur.  (c)    Determine how much settlement will occur after 730 days.    (30 points)     2.   The time for 75% consolidation of a 25 mm clay specimen (drained at top and bottom) in the laboratory is 22 minutes. How long will it take for a 6 m thick clay layer in the field to undergo 55% consolidation under the same pressure increment? In the field, there is a rock layer at the bottom of the clay layer. (25 points)   3.   A fill is placed at the ground surface over the entire site and the weight of the fill is expected to cause a surcharge pressure of 100 psf. This surcharge pressure can cause a consolidation of the clay layer. Assume that at 8 months after the fill is placed, the degree of consolidation at the middle of the clay layer is 50%. Determine the water pressure at the top, middle, and bottom of the clay layer at that time.  [Note 1: at any depth, this water pressure is the sum of the hydrostatic water pressure plus the remaining excess pore water pressure]  [Note 2: Each month is 30 days] (35 points)      4.   A soil sample was taken from a depth of 20 m below the ground surface at a site. Assume that the effective stress (

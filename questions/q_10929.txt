This figure shows the correlation between rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at Mauna Loa (top line) with rising levels of carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean at nearby Station Aloha (middle line), and the consequent effect is has on ocean pH (bottom line). Global warming from carbon dioxide deals a double blow to the oceans because not only does the ocean warm by absorbing part of the atmospheric temperature increase, it also absorbs about one-third of the increase in carbon dioxide, which reacts with water to produce carbonic acid. So, the oceans help to decrease atmospheric carbon dioxide and slow global warming, but with major negative consequences for the chemistry and biology of the oceans.  What impact will this change in ocean pH likely have on humans?

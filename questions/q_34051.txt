The Helsinki Heart Study reported a reduction in the incidence of cardiac events in middle-aged men with high cholesterol levels, but no known coronary artery disease. Of the 2051 subjects who spent five years in a treatment group receiving the cholesterol-reducing drug, 56 had experienced a cardiac event.  Of the 2030 subjects who spent five years in a placebo group, 84 had experienced a cardiac event.  At 5% significance level, is there sufficient evidence of a difference in the incidence rates of cardiac events for the two groups?  Find the p-value (use calculator).

Dr. Metropolis has developed an objective measure to determine whether participants are more "city people" or "rural people." To do this, he generated a list of items that seemed like they'd capture the construct of interest. After collecting data from 100 participants, he factor-analyzed the data to see (1) which items grouped together, and (2) if the items that grouped together shared an interpretable common theme. What methods of objective test construction did Dr. Metropolis use?
TEXT B         AMAPHUTHA ENZIWA NGABANTU NGEMALI     1   Uyakwazi yini ukugcina imali? Lona umbuzo okufanele wonke umuntu azibuze wona ngoba imali ibalulekile kakhulu. Ukwenza ibhajethi kuyasiza ngoba uyakwazi ukubonaukuthi unemali engakanani ongayisebenzisa. Kungabe sonke siyakwazi ukunamathela ebhajethini esiyenzile?     2   Abaluleki bezezimali baveza ukuthi abantu abakwazi ukuhlela indlela yokusebenzisa imali. Kukhona abantu abenza izikweletu ezingaphezu kwemali abayiholayo noma abanayo. Iningi labantu ligcina selinegama elibi, kuvaleke namathuba okuthola usizolwemali emabhange nakwezinye izindawo ezibolekisa ngemali.     3   Ukuzifaka ezikweletini ezingenaso isidingo kuyingozi. Kukhona abantu abahlela ukwenza imicimbi ngemali abangenayo kodwa abasazoyiboleka. Le mali abayibolekayo iba nenzalo (interest) eningi okwenza kube nzima ukuyikhokha.Kuhleukulinda ungazifaki ezindlekweni (expenses) ezingenasidingo.     4   Kunabantu abanezinhliziyo ezingaphandle, abafuna ukuba nayo yonke into abayibonakwabanye. Bathenga izinto abangazidingi ngenxa yomona wokuthi abafuni ukudlulwangabanye. Lokhu kuyingozi ngoba awulazi iphakethe lalowo muntu ozifanisa naye.     5   Izindleko/izidingo zethu ziyakhuphuka zonke izinsuku. Kubalulekile ukubeka imali ukuze ikusize ukubhekana nesimo sokukhula kwezindleko zakho. Abantu uma bebona imali abanayo iseningi bayisebenzisa yonke kungabi namali abayongayo/ abayibekayo. Ukucabangela ikusasa nokulandela uhlelo lokonga imali kuyasiza ukubhekana nesikhathi esinzima.     6   Wonke umuntu uyakuthanda ukuzimela abe nebhizinisi lakhe. Ibhizinisi lidinga ulwazi.Ukuzibambela kwezezimali ebhizinisini nokungaqashi umuntu onolwazi kungenza ukuthi inzuzo yakho ingakhuli. Osomabhizinisi kufanele nabo bafane nabasebenzi babo bazifake ohlelweni lomholo. Lokhu kuzobasiza ukubona imali engenayo nephumayo.       7   Ucwaningo luveza ukuthi abantu abaphila ngezikweletu bangama-80%. Umuntu onganaki ukukhokha izikweletu zakhe uyazibulala ngoba ugcina esekhokha inzalo efakiwe. Ukungabheki izipesheli uma uthenga kuqeda imali. Asiqiniseke ukuthi senza izinto ezibalulekile kuqala ngemali.

Suppose that we have a 2-phase induction motor wherein the 2 phase windings, a and b, are 90deg apart in space.  There are TWO sets of 2-phase winding on the rotor that are in phase with each other.  The a-phase of the two rotor winding sets are very tightly coupled, and therefore have an infinite mutual inductance.  The mutual inductance between both sets of rotor windings and the stator windings is the same.   The same is true for the b-phase.  The parameters of one two phase sets of rotor windings are Rr1 and Lr1, while the other set of rotor windings has parameters Rr2 and Lr2.  Determine a suitable transformation matrix,

The reactions represented below, which are involved in a demonstration commonly known as "underwater fireworks." Reaction 1: CaC2(s) + 2 H2O(l) a C2H2(g) + Ca(OH)2(s)Reaction 2: NaOCl(aq) + 2 HCl(aq) a Cl2(g) + NaCl(aq) + H2O(l) Reaction 3: C2H2(g) + Cl2(g) a C2H2Cl2(g) Ca(OH)2 (s) precipitates when a 1.0 g sample of CaC2 (s) is added to 1.0 L of distilled water at room temperature. If a 0.64 g sample of CaC2(s) (molar mass 64 g/mol) is used instead and all of it reacts, which of the following will occur and why? (The value of Ksp for Ca(OH)2 is 8.0 x 10-8.)

Rotational kinetic energy: A uniform solid sphere of mass M and radius R rotates with an angular speed o about an axis through its center. A uniform solid cylinder of mass M, radius R, and length 2R rotates through an axis running through the central axis of the cylinder. What must be the angular speed of the cylinder so it will have the same rotational kinetic energy as the sphere?

Use the following information to answer Questions 10 and 11. Considine Corporation's CFO has collected the following information: -The company estimates that its EBIT for the upcoming year will be $20 million. -The company's tax rate is 25%. -The company has no growth opportunities--so you can assume that the company's capital expenditures will exactly equal its depreciation expense (i.e., net capital expenditures = 0). Also, the change in net operating working capital is assumed to be 0.  It follows that FCF = NOPAT = $20(1 - 0.25) = $15 million. -Since the company has no growth opportunities, the company's EBIT, NOPAT, and free cash flow will remain constant over time (i.e., you can think of the company's cash flows as a perpetuity). -The company has $750 million in debt outstanding. The debt has a zero beta, so the yield to maturity on the company's debt equals the risk-free rate (3%). -Assume that the company's interest tax savings from debt financing are discounted each year at the unlevered cost of equity. (You can also assume that the level of debt and the firm's capital structure will remain constant over time and that the beta on debt = 0.) -The unlevered cost of equity is estimated to be 6%.

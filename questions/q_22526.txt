For your final examination, you should write a cohesive, well-developed essay that fully addresses the essay prompt. Please closely read the following CQ Researcher articles (published June 13, 2014 (volume 24, issue 22)) and then the prompt below.     "Dropout Rate-Should All States Raise the High School Dropout Age to 18: Pro"by Bob Wise, President of the Alliance for Excellent Education   "Dropout Rate-Should All States Raise the High School Dropout Age to 18: Con"by Franklin Schargel, author of 12 education reform books     par. 1All states should raise the legal high school dropout age to 18, but not because it will automatically increase graduation rates--it won't. Rather they should do it because of the message it sends students, parents, the public and the state about the critical importance of a high school diploma in today's global economy. par. 2Fifty years ago, high school dropouts could still land well-paying jobs and support their families. But times have changed. Today, jobs that require relatively little education are disappearing. According to research from the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, only about 10 percent of jobs are open to high school dropouts, compared with more than 30 percent in 1973. par. 3Still, hundreds of thousands of students continue to drop out of high school every year. But passing a law that forces students to continue going to school must be only a first legislative action, not the final one. In fact, research from the Brookings Institution finds that states with higher compulsory school attendance ages do not have higher graduation rates than states with lower age requirements. Raising the compulsory age does little to address the root causes of why students drop out, which include difficult transitions from middle school to high school, an absence of basic reading and math skills and a lack of engagement. par. 4As states debate whether to increase the compulsory school age, they must also provide the kind of education that engages students and give them a reason to want stay in school. Requiring compulsory attendance also means that state legislators need to plan for the additional classrooms, teachers and other resources needed to serve additional students who are now staying in school. Ensuring that all students have access to effective teachers and rigorous and engaging content is a good place to start--as is additional support, both academic and social--for students who have fallen behind. par. 5Raising the compulsory attendance age can be a powerful motivational tool to express commitment to high school graduation, but only if it's accompanied by supporting policies and resources. While a legislative mandate increasing the compulsory school age can force students to attend school, it can't force them to learn. Provided that policymakers understand this important distinction, raising the dropout age to 18 can be one of the tools in their toolbox to increase high school graduation rates.   par. 1If America is to be globally competitive, it must have a high-performing, highly trained, technologically prepared workforce. And that means, at minimum, a high school diploma. I believe all students should stay in school until they graduate. However, that does not mean that all states should require that students remain in school until they are 18. par. 2U.S. education is primarily a state and local responsibility. But President Obama and a number of state legislatures believe that the dropout age should be raised to 18. There is little data to indicate that will reduce dropout rates, according to a report by the Rennie Center for Education Research and Policy. "Our review revealed that there is little research to support the effectiveness of compulsory attendance laws in achieving these goals," said the report. par. 3Some states that require students to stay in school until age 18 have some of the nation's highest graduation rates (such as Nebraska and Wisconsin, both with 88 percent graduating) and some of the lowest, such as New Mexico (70 percent) and the District of Columbia (59 percent). So it is not the age of mandatory attendance that determines the dropout rate, but other factors. Simply mandating that young people remain in school without addressing the causes for their leaving will accomplish little. par. 4There are five reasons children leave school prior to graduation: (1) The children's bad decisions--getting pregnant, becoming involved in alcohol or drugs, committing crimes; (2) The families they come from--low income, dropouts themselves, a clash of cultures between families and schools, (3) The communities they come from--places where there are gangs, violence, and drugs; (4) The schools they attend, which are toxic to learning; and (5) The teachers they have--we give the least experienced, least trained teachers the most difficult students. par. 5If we wish to eliminate dropouts we need to deal with these causes. By raising the dropout age, we add additional costs, for additional classrooms, teachers, support personnel and alternative online courses. This is foolhardy, especially when so many states have already cut into the marrow of education. Changing the dropout age is a simplistic, sound-bite solution to a complex problem.     _____________________________________________________________________________________ Topic: Using the above-noted articles, "Dropout Rate-Should All States Raise the High School Dropout Age to 18: Pro" and "Dropout Rate-Should All States Raise the High School Dropout Age to 18: Con," as reference sources, write an essay in which you analyze each author's use of one rhetorical tool or rhetorical appeal to achieve his or her specific purpose.  To start, determine what you believe is each author's specific purpose. Choose one of the following specific purposes for each author: to accuse, to calm, to condemn, to celebrate, to correct, to counter, to defend, to dismiss, to incite, to justify, to overturn, to praise, to provoke, to rally, to silence, or to solve.   Then, determine which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Pro" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose and then which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Con" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose. You must choose both rhetorical tools and/or appeals from the following list:       allusions authorities/outside sources definitions description dialogue examples facts figurative language narration personal testimony/anecdotes scenarios statistics counterarguments concessions qualifiers organization voice appeal to logic appeal to emotion appeal to character appeal to need appeal to value       Organize your ideas into a four-paragraph essay that includes the following paragraphs: (paragraph 1) an introduction paragraph; (paragraphs 2 and 3) two separate, well-developed rhetorical tools and/or rhetorical appeals body paragraphs (one focused on the "Pro" author's use of your chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose and the other focused on the "Con" author's use of your other chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose); and (paragraph 4) a conclusion paragraph. Your essay must include a forecasting thesis statement and effective topic and concluding sentences in each body paragraph. At least four times in your essay, you also must correctly integrate quotations, paraphrases, and/or summaries from the above-noted articles; remember to include proper in-text citations.

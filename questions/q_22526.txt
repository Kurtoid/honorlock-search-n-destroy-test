A 654-N box is sitting on a ramp that is angled 28 degrees from horizontal.  A 200.0-N force, directed parallel to the ramp in the direction towards the bottom of the ramp, is applied to the box.  The coefficient of static friction between the ramp and the box is 0.900 and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the ramp and the box is 0.600.  a. (15 pts) Determine if the box will slide when the 200.0-N force is applied. Justify your answer with words AND calculations.  Write out your calculations on paper (blank paper or a blank problem-solving template).  Enter your justification in the box below, explaining your answer and referencing the relevant calculations. b. (5 pts) If the box does not slide, determine the size of the force of friction acting on the box. If the box does slide, determine the size of the acceleration of the box.  Show your calculations on paper.  Enter your answer, with units, into the box below.

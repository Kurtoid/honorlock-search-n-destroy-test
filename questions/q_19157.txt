Questions 35 - 37 refers to the excerpt below. Behind me stands a wall that encircles the free sectors of this city, part of a vast system of barriers that divides the entire continent of Europe. From the Baltic, south, those barriers cut across Germany in a gash of barbed wire, concrete, dog runs, and guard towers. . . . In the 1950s, Khrushchev predicted: "We will bury you." But in the West today, we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well-being unprecedented in all human history. In the Communist world, we see failure, technological backwardness, declining standards of health, even want of the most basic kind--too little food. Even today, the Soviet Union still cannot feed itself. After these four decades, then, there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion: Freedom leads to prosperity. Freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among the nations with comity and peace. Freedom is the victor. . . . As I looked out a moment ago from the Reichstag, that embodiment of German unity, I noticed words crudely spray-painted upon the wall, perhaps by a young Berliner: "This wall will fall. Beliefs become reality." Yes, across Europe, this wall will fall. For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth. The wall cannot withstand freedom.

Your childhood friend, Sally, just inherited a dormant strawberry farm from her grandmother. Sally's goal is to plant the best tasting organic strawberry in the Tampa area. She wants to compare three types of strawberries (i.e., Sweet Charlies, Stargazer Perennials, and Seascape Delights) and two types of organic food (i.e., 50% bone meal and 100% bone meal). She knows that you are at UF and taking Research Methods so she asks you to design a study, compute the statistical analyses, and interpret the findings in determining the best tasting organic strawberry for her farm.       A. List the necessary steps involved in conducting this study including the experimental design. B. Do as complete statistical analysis as possible, and label your work.

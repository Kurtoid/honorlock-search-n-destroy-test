You are studying a rare single gene hereditary disease (SIK) in a mouse model. You have a plasmid in the lab that carries DNA from the region near the disease gene sik. To map the DNA clone relative to the sik gene, a restriction fragment length polymorphism is identified. Your plasmid DNA clone hybridizes to a 10kb fragment in purebreeding strain A. It also hybridizes to two fragments, 7kb and 3kb, in pure breeding strain B. An affected strain A female is mated with an unaffected strain B male, and their children are then mated with each other. The pedigree and Southern blot are shown below  1. What is the mode of inheritance. 2. What is the genotypes of II-3 and III-9. Choose the right answer combination for both questions.

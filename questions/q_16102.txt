THIS IS A MULTI-PART QUESTION. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ANSWER ALL PARTS. You are working for a company developing a novel anti-inflammatory treatment for arthritis. You want the anti-inflammatory protein to be released locally in the joint to stop macrophage infiltration in the joint capsule, which activates a degenerative cascade in the rest of the joint. Inflammatory macrophage infiltration and activation is mediated by MMP-13, and therefore you want the release of the drug to occur only when MMP-13 is elevated locally in the joint. You expect release of the anti-inflammatory to subsequently decease macrophage infiltration and activation and, consequently, MMP-13 production. You propose to engineer a bioresponsive drug delivery system that can be injected directly into the joint.   A) (2 pts) Why might local delivery of an anti-inflammatory protein drug be more desirable than systemic administration? B) (5 pts) Describe how you would design an MMP-responsive hydrogel carrier that would release the drug in response to local concentrations of MMP? What characteristics would be important for preventing/minimizing passive release? C) (3 pts) Describe how you could ensure this system is injectable (i.e. can be injected through a syringe into the joint and then forms a hydrogel). You don't have to name specific polymers, but do specify what polymer characteristics are needed to achieve this. D) (2 pts) You test your system by injecting it into arthritic joints in rats. In this experiment, how would you determine if the anti-inflammatory drug remains localized to the joint (i.e. what data would you collect).

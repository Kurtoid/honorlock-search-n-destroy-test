The evolution of complex genomes requires that new combinations of pre-existing protein domains successfully fold into modular polypeptides. During eukaryotic translation, model two-domain polypeptides fold efficiently by sequential and co-translational folding of their domains. In contrast, folding of the same proteins in Escherichia coli is post-translational, and could lead to intramolecular misfolding of concurrently folding domains.  a) Explain how prokaryotes may compensate for this issue. b) A related issue is translational error rates are roughly 1 error in every 4000 amino acids incorporated.  What different strategies might prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells use to deal with this issue?  And how much of a problem is that really??

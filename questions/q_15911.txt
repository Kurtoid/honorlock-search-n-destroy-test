Please separate answers clearly for each question part. Consider hexokinase I, found in muscle tissue, and hexokinase IV (glucokinase), found in hepatocytes. Predict if the Km for hexokinase I is higher or lower than the Km for hexokinase IV. What does this value indicate regarding the binding affinity of the enzyme for its substrate (1 point)? Explain your answer by describing the differentiated roles of these tissues regarding glucose metabolism and transport (1 point). Explain why enzymes like hexokinase I and hexokinase IV are considered isozymes, while enzymes like PFK-1 and PFK-2 are not considered isozymes (1 point).

A ventricular rhythm with a heart rate of < 20 is:
The temperature distribution on the flat plate is given as follows: T(y = 0) = 100 degC; T(x = 0) = 100 degC; T(x = a) = 100 degC; T(y = b) = 200 degC; Using the analytical solution for the temperature distribution of a 2-D plate, find the temperature in the center of the plate if a = 1, b = a/2. Use n = 3 for the summation term.

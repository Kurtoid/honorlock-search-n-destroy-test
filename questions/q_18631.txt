A parallel-plate capacitor of capacitance C0 has plates of area A with separation d between them. When it is connected to a battery of voltage V0, it has charge of magnitude Q0 on its plates. It is then disconnected from the battery and the space between the plates is filled with a material of dielectric constant 3. After the dielectric is added, the magnitudes of the charge on the plates and the potential difference between them are

When writing this exam, I attempted to effectively cover material that we have learned in the second part of this quarter. But with the limitations of a 2 hour exam, you have assuredly studied and learned a lot more than I could possibly cover in this exam! Please consider any single topic you learned about that I didn't ask you about on this exam, name the topic, and then carefully explain that topic here. If you can't think of anything you studied that I didn't cover, or you think I covered everything, please instead just pick any topic you learned about and explain it to me. Write at least a short paragraph (minimum 4-5 sentences), although you may go longer. Please do not just list names of multiple topics, or just tell me you found [name of topic] to be really interesting. You may tell me [name of topic] was really interesting, but you must demonstrate to me that you learned about and understand the topic by explaining to me how it works. Relax, and please don't stress - this is your chance to choose your own topic/question and show me you learned something from this course by telling me about it - i.e., this is meant to be a very gentle last question on this exam! :)

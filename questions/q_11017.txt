The Weissman Corporation is a medical lab in Tampa, Florida that is considering entering into a contract with the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) to test people for COVID -19. If they are to enter into this contract, they will have to purchase additional equipment that will be depreciated using a five-year MACRS schedule.  Based on the guidelines as proposed by the CDC, the following estimates were generated.  Cost of the equipment: $4,000,000 Revenues: $2,100,000 for the first year, then decreasing by $50,000 per year for the five-year evaluation period. Operations will cease at the end of the five-year period. The equipment will be depreciated using a MACRS over a five-year period with no salvage value. The five-year MACRS is as follows:      Year   0   1   2   3   4   5     Depreciation   20%   32%   19.2%   11.52%   11.52%   5.76%      Variable costs, including supplies, technicians, maintenance etc. is expected to be 45% of revenues. Weissman's tax rate is 40%. Prior to beginning operations as a testing facility, working capital in the amount of $50,000 will be invested into supplies of PPE and other supplies to keep the labs operational. There will be NO additional working capital needs during the five-year project, however, the $50,000 in working capital will be returned at the end of the five-year project.  Weissman's cost of capital is estimated to be 8%. Based on this, what is the project's NPV?

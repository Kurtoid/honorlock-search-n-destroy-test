Please read the following description of a pathological condition.  Secondary to prolonged sitting resulting from bad posture habits, the spinal ligaments in a lumbar segment become overstretched. As a result the Type I and Type II receptors located in the joint capsule are disrupted and destroyed. Reduced afferent impulses from type I receptors decrease tonic reflexogenic activity in the muscles. The transverso-spinal muscles, which are 70% tonic, show decreased activity. This reduces the spine's ability to provide segmental stabilization. Segmental motion now occurs around a non-physiological axis due to inhibition of the muscles that guide motion and to a destabilization incurred by Ligamentous laxity. Coupled movement of the spine, which requires precise vertebral movement around physiologic axes, is now in jeopardy. Under these conditions, the facet joint's ligaments, capsule, fascia, and muscles are exposed to trauma during movement. These now hypermobile joints are predisposed to locking by tissue becoming entrapped within a facet joint. Due to trauma, type IV receptors are activated leading to tonic reflexogenic guarding. A sequence of physiologic events is initiated in response to trauma, which leads to immobility and the production of scar tissue. An initially hypermobile joint is now hypomobile. Articulation or manipulation, using type I and type II mechanoreceptors, inhibits pain and guarding while resolving the locking. Mobilization might also combine contraction of the multifidus muscle. By gapping the facet joint and contracting the multifidus muscle, the entrapped material is pulled from within the facet joint. The now mobile joint must be stabilized through and appropriate exercise program. Pain is resolved with the manual techniques while the joint is still hypermobile and unstable. It requires stabilizing exercises to prevent future locking.  What pathological condition is described above?

On June 1, 2018, Heather Property Management entered into a 2-year contract to oversee leasing and maintenance for an apartment building. The contract starts on July 1, 2018. Under the terms of the contract, Heather will be paid a fixed fee of $50,000 per year and will receive an additional 10% of the fixed fee at the end of each year provided that building occupancy exceeds 90%. Heather estimates a 70% chance it will exceed the occupancy threshold, and concludes the revenue recognition over time is appropriate for this contract.  Assume Heather estimates variable consideration as the most likely amount. How much revenue should Heather recognize on this contract in 2018?
Use the information provided in the following case study to the question in bold   Information Obtained During the First Visit/Encounter:             Julie B., 18 years old, was referred to the public health nursing clinic. She and her mother live in a remote area of the county. She is 20 weeks pregnant, her blood pressure is 140/92, and her weight was 170 pounds. Her reported height was 5'4". She gained 30 pounds since becoming pregnant. The nurse arranged for transportation and a first appointment at the tribal health clinic the next day where she would receive medical care and other services such as prenatal classes and medications. The nurse referred Julie to a local food pantry, and the clinic's Women, Infant, and Children's program (WIC) and a nutritionist for detailed instructions about her prescribed diet. Julie and the nurse discussed her experiences with children and her feelings about pregnancy and parenthood. They also discussed healthy pregnancy, parenting, community resources, and sources of support during future meetings scheduled at the clinic and Julie's home.     Question: Give an example of another intervention (from the intervention wheel) that the nurse utilized with Julie. Provide you answer in the space below.

Two different genes are located on the SAME chromosome, relatively close together:  a gene for plant height and a gene for leaf size.  "Tallness" (T) is dominant to "shortness" (t) and "big leaves" (B) is dominant to "small leaves" (b).  If one chromosome of a homologous pair has the T allele at the gene for plant height and a B allele at the gene from leaf size, and if the other chromosome of the homologous pair has the t allele at the plant height gene and a b allele at the leaf size gene, the plant's genotype is TtBb.  What gametes would you expect this plant to produce?

Note: this question requires two written answers! Anolis lizards (anoles) live on islands in the Caribbean. On these islands, anole species that live on the ground have long legs and a long tail, which allows them to move quickly to catch prey and avoid predators. Anole species that live on bushes have short legs and a short tail to help them walk on twigs and small branches without falling off. All male anoles have brightly colored dewlaps (throat skin flaps) that are used to attract females.  A. What mode of natural selection (disruptive, stabilizing, or directional) is operating on anole leg size on the ground, if anoles with longer legs produce more offspring than anoles with intermediate or short legs? Explain your answer, using complete sentences. (3 pts.) B. What type of sexual selection (intraspecific or interspecific) is operating on anole dewlap coloration, if females choose to mate with males with brighter-colored dewlaps more often than males with duller dewlaps? Explain your answer, using complete sentences. (3 pts.)

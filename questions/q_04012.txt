More modern methods use a compound known as MEA (monoethanolamine) to chemically absorb carbon dioxide and form a new compound. The advantage is that this reaction can easily be reversed: heating up the new compound to a high temperature releases carbon dioxide and regenerates MEA, which can then be reused.  Once the carbon dioxide is released from the MEA absorber, it must be released from the submarine. However, in order for this carbon dioxide to be pushed out of the submarine, it must first be pressurized to a pressure equal to the external pressure outside the submarine. At a depth of 2 kilometers, this pressure can be upwards of 200 atmospheres. At this pressure, do you expect carbon dioxide to behave like an ideal gas? If so, explain why. If not, briefly describe which postulate(s) of kinetic molecular theory break down. (I will dock points if you ramble too much - keep your answer straight to the point!)

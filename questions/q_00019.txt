Conflict is an inevitable part of every person's life. Everyone deals with conflict in a more or less individual manner. At the same time, five general patterns of reacting to conflict can be identified. One such pattern is withdrawal, the physical or psychological removal from a conflict situation. Another manner of dealing with conflict is surrender, giving in immediately to another's wishes in order to avoid an argument. Aggression is a third way to deal with conflict.  Those favoring aggressive behavior try to force other people to accept the aggressor's opinions. Conflict also can be dealt with through persuasion, or attempting to change the behavior or attitude of another person.  A final means of dealing with conflict is discussion, or verbal problem solving, in which the pros and cons of the issue in conflict are weighed and considered.

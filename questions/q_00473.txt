Some photosynthetic organisms run a "reverse" TCA cycle to meet their metabolic needs for carbon. These organisms produce ATP and reducing power (NADH) using a light-driven photosynthetic electron transport chain rather than NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) or Succinate dehydrogenase (complex II)-driven electron transport chain. Light promotes electron transport generating a proton gradient that is subsequently used by complex V. The carbon needs for these organisms are satisfied by utilizing acetate (formed by two molecules of CO2), which can be converted to acetyl-CoA. As shown below, three amino acid metabolic pathways are directly linked to the reverse TCA cycle, and carbon fixation refers to the production of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which can be subsequently fed into any metabolic pathway for production of necessary carbon compounds in this organism. Based upon your understanding of metabolic regulation, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle, answer the questions on the following page.       a) Indicate the enzyme classification numbers for enzymes (noted in boxes with various digits) that you would predict as distinct from those normally associated with the "forward" TCA cycle and pyruvate metabolism. Provide a brief explanation for your choices. b) Suggest a model for carbon metabolism regulation in these organisms for those pathways represented. How are carbon fixation, glutamate production, alanine production, and aspartate production balanced?  c) Propose a detailed model for how carbon and energy metabolism in these organisms are regulated in respect to one another. (How does acetate metabolism respond under various energy generating conditions?? )

The cell reaction for a dry cell battery is   Zn(s) + 2 MnO2(s) + 2 NH4+(aq) - 2 NH3(aq) + Mn2O3(s) + Zn2+(aq) + H2O(l).   The standard cell potential for this cell is 1.56 V. What is the standard free energy change for this cell?

Excel Task 6      (max 9 pts) Go to the "Restaurants" sheet of the exam file. Management wants to give an award to the most productive Regional Manager.  Create a pivot table that lists all the regional managers (one per row) and shows the total number of customer visits last year.  Sort the pivot table so that the manager with the most customer visits is at the top of the pivot table.  Be careful -- we're asking for the Regional Manager, not the local manager. Name the pivot table's sheet as "Pivot-Managers"   NOTES:  This task will be graded manually, based on our evaluation of the XLSX file you submit.
In 2016, I was crossing flying from Canada to the Hawaiian island of Oahu and I had a bag of Washington State apples with me. The customs officer at the Honolulu airport would not let me take the apples with me into the island (and I really hated the idea of getting rid of a bag of perfectly good apples). Why did the customs officer refuse to allow me take the apples with me?

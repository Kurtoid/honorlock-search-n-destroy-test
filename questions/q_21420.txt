35Cl = 75.78% 37Cl = 24.22 %                  Ratio 35Cl:37Cl ~ 3:1 (M+ and M+2) 79Br = 50.69% 81Br = 49.31 %                  Ratio 79Br:81Br ~ 1:1(M+ and M+2)                                                                      Ratio Br2: ~ 1:2:1 (M+, M+2, M+4)   C = (M+1)/(M)(0.011); DOU = (2C+2-H-X+N)/2   The formula for this structure is C6H6NBr.  Analyze the 1H NMR below and then propose a structure.  The second spectra is a zoomed in region between 6.5 and 7.5 ppm so you can see splitting pattern.  The singlet peak at 6.84 has complex splitting.  The weak peak at 7.25 is a solvent peak and not part of the structure.  Determine the multiplicity of all unique protons.  Match the protons in the structure to proton peaks in the spectra.  Briefly explain your choices. PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR WORK TO THE POST EXAM WITHIN 10 MINUTES OF COMPLETING YOUR EXAM.

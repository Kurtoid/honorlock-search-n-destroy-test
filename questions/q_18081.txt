Integrative 2 Consider the following simple frequency distribution that shows scores from a surfing competition in California (*assume the data are continuous*): (22 pts. total)     x   f     15   2     14   7     13   10     12   6     11   4     10   9     9   3       a.  Using interpolation, find the raw score corresponding to the 66th percentile rank. (5 pts.)   b.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the dataset (assume you have a sample distribution).  (6 pts.)   c.  Imagine that the original scores were calculated incorrectly, and that the judges now have to subtract five points from each person's score to correct the error. Recalculate M and s for the dataset.  (5 pts.)   d.  The same competition was held at several locations worldwide.  The average score at the competition in Hawaii was 13.2, with 80 competitors, and the average in Sydney, Australia was 16.7, with 125 competitors. What is the overall mean score for all three competition locations (California, Hawaii, Australia) combined?  (6 pts.)  *NOTE: Use the California data from part b, above, for this calculation.   NOTE:  If you want to work with the table in the text box, copy and paste the table into the text box.  You can then use the table icon (go to ellipsis menu) to edit the table (for example, by adding rows or columns). PLEASE LABEL YOUR ANSWERS WITH (a), (b), (c) and (d).

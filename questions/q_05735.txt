A three sectored basestation is being designed for an 1800MHz cellular system using a 102 m guyed tower. Each sector will use a 17dB gain antenna with 2 dB of line and connector loss between the antenna and the transmitter/amplifier equipment. It is required that the EIRP of the basestation is 1585W.  What is the EIRP of the basestation in dBm? What is the transmitter/amplifier power (in dBm) required to achieve this EIRP? Use the urban COST-231 model adjusted for a medium sized city to predict the path loss 5 km from the basestation in dB. Assume that the ground is flat enough to ignore diffraction and that the mobile antenna term and adjustment factor in the COST-231 equation can be ignored as well (that is, assume a(h)=0 and Cm =0). Assuming the path loss is given by 3. above, what will the received signal strength be at 5 km in dBm ( assuming that the mobile is directly in front of the panel antenna)?

DIFFERENT FACTS: While on routine traffic patrol, Officer Grendell observed a car driving around a general business district. The car would travel slowly as some points, stop completely at times in roadway, pause for a short time, and then proceed driving. The car would then turn into a driveway, back up, change directions to come down the street and repeat the same traffic pattern. Officer Grendel observed the vehicle make three separate trips up and down the street. Officer Grendell believed that the driver was either looking for a parking space or was waiting for a partner in crime to exit one of the various stores after robbing it.

At this point Ms. Escobar was arrested for driving without proof of insurance (a minor misdemeanor subject only to a fine upon conviction). This is not an arrestable offense under state law. The arrest of Ms. Escobar was:

H1: Charging and Charge Dissipation (5 pts) During flight fast moving airplanes, such as commercial airliners, can build up massive electrical charges as they fly through and rub past air and clouds. This potentially dangerous charge results from the type of charging called [a]. This type of charging means that the plane is able to 'steal' [b] from the air and clouds as it passes through them. The plane is able to steal these particles because it has a higher [c] than the surrounding air and clouds. Once the plane lands this charge must be safely dissipated before refueling and unloading/loading of passengers, where a single spark of electricity could be deadly. This is best done through the method of charge dissipation known as [d], where the electric charge is safely conducted into a [e] object (like the Earth) that can absorb the charge without danger.

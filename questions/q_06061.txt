Williams Windows manufactures and sells custom storm windows for enclosed porches. Williams also provides installation service for the windows. The installation process does not involve changes in the windows, so this service can be provided by other vendors. Williams enters into the following contract on June 1, 2021, with a local homeowner. The customer purchases windows for a price of $4,700 and chooses Williams to do the installation. Williams charges the same price for the windows irrespective of whether it does the installation or not. The price of the installation service is estimated to have a fair value of $1,200. The customer pays Williams $4,000 (which equals the fair value of the windows, which have a cost of $2,300) upon delivery and the remaining balance upon installation of the windows. The windows are delivered on August 1, 2021, Williams completes installation on September 15, 2021, and the customer pays the balance due. Required: Prepare the journal entries for Williams in 2021. (Round amounts to nearest dollar.)

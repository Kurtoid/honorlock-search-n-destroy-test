The next three questions address different aspects of a three-part fraud examination case. Fraud Investigation Case Part 1 NNS Ltd. is a privately owned, mid-size company based on the eastern seaboard. It produces hypersensitive nautical navigational systems that are in use in most of the world's major shipping fleets. The company provides some systems to the U.S. Coast Guard, although the vast majority of its customers are private fleets. Brenda Farrell is NNS's CEO. She recently received an internal audit report indicating a series of 15 monthly disbursements between $9,500 and $9,999 to Quantix Systems. The invoices from Quantix provide no description of the purchases and are all consecutively numbered. Any of the company's three procurement managers can approve invoices below $10,000 without a second authorization. The report noted that one of the three procurement managers, Jason Teagard, signed off on nine of the invoices in question. It appears that Farrell, the CEO, approved the other six invoices. The report also states that Teagard has recently started arriving late to work and appears to be under a great deal of stress. Farrell contacts you, the company's head of security, to review the facts of the case. Farrell tells you that she does not remember approving any invoices to Quantix and has never heard of the company. She directs you to begin an investigation of the suspected fraud. Part 1 Question 1: Based on the information above, do you believe you have sufficient predication to begin an investigation? Consider 1) factors that support an investigation and 2) reasons why you might not want to proceed. Part 1 Question 2: Assuming that you decide to conduct an examination, briefly outline the fraud examination methodology you would follow in investigating this case. Make sure your examination steps reflect the specific issues involved in the case.

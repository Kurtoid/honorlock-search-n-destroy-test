Problem #1 (28 points):  In the amplifier shown below, the transistors are biased in the active region.  The dc emitter current of Q1 is IE1 = 1 mA and the dc emitter current of Q2 is IE2 = 10 mA.  Also hFE  = IC/IB = 80 (transistor b) for both transistors, neglect the Early effect (VA = [?]), and the capacitors are very large. Find the voltage gain vo/vs and the input resistance Rin.

You are heavily in debt as a result of betting large sums of money on Greyhound (Dog) Races in Naples, Florida.  A friend of yours reveals that she learned to classify muscle fiber types when she participated in a BIMS 489 research project at TAMU.  She owes you a huge favor, so you ask her to histologically examine biopsies of the hamstring muscles that have been secretly obtained from 5 dogs entered into next week's high stakes race.  She reluctantly agrees and gives you the following report comparing the skeletal muscle cells and vascularization of these muscles:                                 Dog 1 - most extensive capillary network                                Dog 2 - lowest concentration of mitochondria                                Dog 3 - largest fiber diameter                                Dog 4 - greatest concentration of glycogen                                Dog 5 - smallest ratio of low myosin ATPase to high myosin ATPase                 Being a betting person and desperate to get out of debt, you quickly violate all ethical and legal standards and bet on the race.  Recognizing that the upcoming race is for an extremely long distance, you should place your bet on:

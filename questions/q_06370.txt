Dissolving 3.0 g of CaCl2(s) in 150.0 g of water in a calorimeter (Figure 5.12) at 22.4 degC causes the temperature to rise to 25.8 degC. What is the approximate amount of heat involved in this dissolution? Assume that the specific heat and the density of the solution is the same as that of  water.  The specific heat capacity for water is 4.184 J/g.oC, and the density of water is 1.0 g/mL.   (If you wish, you can show math work for possible partial credit.)

EXTRA CREDIT STRESS SCENARIOS - For each of the following graphs, explain WHAT IS HAPPENING to raise the glucocorticoids (cortisol) level of the animals.  Note that you must go beyond what is already stated, which may require that you speculate on the cause of the glucocorticoids rise.  (Worth 1 point each)   WILD DOGS - Creel et al. (1997) measured glucocorticoid levels in African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) with or without radio collars to investigate whether the process of capture and anesthesia involved in collaring wild dogs leads to chronic stress or increased mortality.  African wild dogs are one of Africa's most endangered large mammals, with less than 7000 remaining in the wild. Studies of radiocollared wild dogs have identified ecological factors that regulate wild dog numbers, and this information is important for conserving the species.  The investigators were concerned that captured and collared dogs might be subject to higher levels of aggression from pack members leading to reduced survival.  The study indicated that there was no difference in the survival of collared versus uncollared animals.  Note that the P-values are displayed on the figure.

Elizabeth decides to hold a yard sale to get rid of stuff in her attic. She finds a grungy old picture, which she thinks is awful and decides to put a price on it of $20.00, but she doesn't really expect anyone to buy that piece of junk. Donald sees it and likes it, but he doesn't think it's worth $20.00, so he offers Elizabeth $10.00. Elizabeth is relieved someone will actually pay her $10.00 for the picture, so she gladly sells it to Donald for $10.00. Later, quite by accident, Donald discovers that the picture is a long lost painting by a famous artist and it is actually worth $1,500,000.00, so he sells it for that amount. Imagine Elizabeth's surprise when she finds out! She sues Donald for at least half the amount for which it was sold, since the consideration is shockingly inadequate, it would be unjust for Donald to get the full price, and because they made a mistake in value. Elizabeth wins her case.

Annually, the United Nations (UN) surveys each of its 187+ member countries on the state of country happiness.  As an analyst for the UN you are interested in looking at predicting country happiness.  You collect data on 131 countries.  Variable definitions are provided below. Dependent Variable - Happiness - takes on the value of 0-10 and is the average reported happiness measure for each country Independent Variables: Loggdp  - is the (GDP/total population) and is a measure of country wealth and economic well-being Choice (Freedom to make life choices) - takes on the value from 0 to 1.  The more freedom people perceive in making life decisions without government interference the closer the value is to 1.

In contrast, Germany eduind = .94, meaning that 94% of Germans have completed 10 years of education - the minimum education requirement in Germany.   a.

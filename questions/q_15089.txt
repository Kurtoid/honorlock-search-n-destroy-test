Root of the problem   Plants use roots to search for water in patches of soil. A certain amount of energy must be spent to build a tap root that spreads from the base of the plant to the patch of soil. After that, additional energy can be used to make fine roots that explore the patch and extract water. Whatever energy the plant does not spend on roots, it can invest in reproductive structures such as flowers and fruits. The graph below shows the relationship between the energy invested in roots and the water extracted from each patch of soil.  Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 31-35.       31. The optimal strategy maximizes the water gained per unit of energy invested in roots.

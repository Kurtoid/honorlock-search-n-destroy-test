In a population of 545 fowls that are either brown or white, brown color is dominant to white color.  Of this population, approximately 230 individuals are white.  Assuming that the population is at equilibrium for this gene/locus, answer the following.  Part A: Calculate the allele frequencies and genotype frequencies (p,2pq, etc.).  Perform all calculations to three decimal places.   (Note: you will NOT be scored on part A, but your work in part A, will be required to do Part B.)   Part B: BONUS: After the previous predictions were made, actual samples were obtained from all individuals in the population described above.  Genetic analyses were done, and it was found that of those that were brown, 94 are homozygous dominant and 221 are heterozygous.  Is the population above at equilibrium? Use the chi-square test to determine this.   (The chi-square formula and chart is shown below the questions for convenience.) Answer the following:  1. What was the chi-square value? 2. What was the df (degree of freedom) that you used? 3. Did you accept or reject the hypothesis? Why? 4. Is the population at equilibrium? Why or why not?

The following True/False questions pertain to the journal article discussed in class, Enhancer architecture sensitizes cell specific responses to Notch gene dose via a bind and discard mechanism.    A. True/False:  One copy of the 6xSPS-GBE-lacZ synthetic enhancer produced significant wing nicking in Drosophila.   B. True/False:  None of the synthetic enhancers containing only CSL sites, e.g. 12CG, gave wing nicks in Drosophila.   C. True/False:  The Grainyhead (Grh) pioneer transcription factor binding element (3xGBE) was required in all synthetic enhancers to observe a wing nicking phenotype.      D. True/False:  The synthetic enhancer G6S in a Notch heterozygous (N[55e11]/+) background decreased the number of macrochaetae compared yw (N[55e11]/+) heterozygous flies.   E. True/False:  The synthetic enhancer 6SG in a Hairless heterozygous (H[1]/+) background increased the number of macrochaetae compared yw (H[1]/+) heterozygous flies.

(For graduate students enrolled in EGM5444) A rocket of mass M and moment of inertia I is constrained to move in a horizontal plane. Its thrust is directed such that its velocity is always directed toward a target which moves along the x-axis according to xtarget = a sin wt. A torque T about the center of mass controls the orientation of the craft. Ignore the physical dimensions of the rocket.  Find the constraint equation on the velocity. Find the constraint equation on the orientation of the rocket. Find the coefficients of the Lagrange multipliers. Find the generalized forces associated with the coordinates x, y, q and f for the force F and torque T. Find the equations of motion.

The reaction between sucrose and water to produce fructose and glucose is first order overall. The data below shows the change in concentration of sucrose over time at 298K.    A) Using the data above, calculate the rate constant, k, (including appropriate units) for the decomposition of sucrose at 298K. The initial concentration (when t = 0 seconds) is 1.002M. B) Using the rate constant that you determined in Part A, how long will it take for the concentration of sucrose to decrease from 1.002M to 0.212M? C) What is the half-life for the decomposition of sucrose?
If you were given extra credit.  Please tell me when, for what, and how much.  This way I can easily verify it with my notes.
Problem 1: Let y(t)= r(t)-r(t-1)-r(t-2)+r(t-3)-u(t-3)+u(t-4), where r(t) is the ramp function.   a) plot y(t)    (10 pts.) b) plot z(t)=y(2t-1)  (10 pts.) c) plot y'(t)  (10 pts.) d) calculate the energy of y(t)  (10 pts.)   note: r(t)=t for t>=0 and 0 for t
Jim is late for work and driving over the posted speed limit.  He was warned by his boss that if he is late one more time, he will be fired.  Jim is pulled over by a police officer who intends to write him a speeding ticket.   Jim tells the officer that he has done nothing wrong and shouldn't get a ticket because he was driving fast to get to work because he is late and might lose his job if he is late again.  He tells the officer that he is just trying to save his job and shouldn't be punished for that.  He says to the officer " Besides, who decided this busy road should be 35 miles per hour, anyway? That's just stupid." Kohlberg would say that Jim is demonstrating which stage of moral reasoning?

A logistic model was created to try and determine if a customer will use a discount coupon if it is sent to them.  In the training data, a (1) was assigned if the customer used the coupon and (0) if the customer did not use the coupon.  They believe that the likelihood the customer will use the coupon is related to the amount of purchases they have and if they have a certain credit card.  (Card_1 is 1 if they have the card and 0 otherwise.)        P(1)   =   exp(Y')/(1 + exp(Y'))         Y'   =   -15.42 + 0.305 Purchases + 6.94 Card_1       1. Given the Minitab output of the Logistic Regression equation, calculate the odds ratio for the variable, "Purchases." [1] 2. Interpret what your calculated odds ratio represents.[2] 3. If the amount of purchases the customer has is 29.27 and they have a credit card, what would be the predicted probability for using the coupon?[3]

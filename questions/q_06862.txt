The only thing the complex seems to lack is a dog park. You have two golden retrievers, and you notice many of your neighbors also have dogs. While walking your dogs around the complex one afternoon, you talk to many of them while they are also out walking their dogs. All of you agree that a dog park would be a nice addition to the complex. Currently, the only places to walk dogs is in the parking lots around the complex. In the summer months, the pavement must get very hot. There are a few patches of grass here and there, but not enough for a dog to take a walk or run freely. You notice that the apartment complex property has quite a bit of undeveloped grassy areas, and any one of these areas could be fenced in to create a dog park. Write to the property owners, McGraw Communities, to make a request to create a dog park for this apartment complex. Make up addresses and any necessary details.

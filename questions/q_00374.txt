Gram stain A slide was prepared by swabbing the inside of a human cheek. This slide was then Gram stained and observed microscopically. Explain why the human epithelial cells on this slide appear pink after the Gram stain procedure.
Assume the Hudson Company uses the constant gross margin percentage NRV method of allocating joint costs and Skim Milk had $14,560 of separable costs while Goat Curd had $25,560 of separable costs.  Please note: these separable costs will be used again in question 19. What dollar amount of joint costs will be allocated to Goat Curd?  Round percentages and interim/final dollar amounts to two (2) decimal places (e.g., 24.3657% would be 24.37% and $107.6457 would be $107.65)

A sports manufacturer estimates demand for its curling rocks to be 5,000 per year.  It costs $2 to store 1 curling rock for 1 year.  Each time the manufacturer must produce additional rocks, it costs the company $200 to set up production.   (a) If x represents the number of curling rocks manufactured at a time, write a cost function that models storage and production serup costs. (b) Using the cost equation found in step (a) and optimization techniques, find the number of curling rocks that should be produced at a time to minimize cost. (c) How many times a year should the sports manufacturer produce curling rocks to minimize costs?

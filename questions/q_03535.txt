Then write where you expect to see large amounts of precipitation and where you expect to see very dry conditions at the surface of the Earth, based on the pattern of global atmospheric circulation.  The horizontal lines are drawn every 30o of latitude. Figure 25 Correct Drawing: [drawing] Where would you expect to find high precipitation and arid conditions?  Be specific.

(b) (4 points) Draw a histogram of these scores, using class intervals of length 10 (so that your intervals are 20-30, 30-40, and so on). Based on your histogram, is the score distribution left-skewed, right-skewed, neither, or both? (Your answer to this part should just address the skewness question -- you don't have to try to represent the histogram for me.) (c) (4 points) Compute the mean exam score   x -   . (d) (4 points) Is the mean score you computed in part (c) greater or less than the median score? Is this the result you would expect given the skewness you observed in part (b)? (Please put your answer to each part on a separate line, and start that line with (a), (b), (c) or (d) as appropriate, so that I know which answer is supposed to go with each part.)

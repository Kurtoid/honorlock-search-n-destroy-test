Feed the Children, Americold and Tyson Foods are aligning to deliver meals to communities across the U.S. throughout the year. Tyson Foods donates protein, Americold donates temperature-controlled storage and Feed the Children manages distribution through its community partners across the U.S. (This is fact, the rest is fiction) Feed The Children is left to manage the cost of transporting the donations. Each month, Feed the Children pays for truck load transport between the Tyson Plant in Cummings and the Americold facilities it uses for distribution. Those trucks carry up to 40,000 lbs of food and cost $3/mile as they have temperature controlled trailers. Feed the Children relies on a third party to make these deliveries and so pays one-way. See Table 2 for those distances. You can download Table 2 & Table 3 Tyson Americold Feed the Children.xlsx  Table 2:  Estimated Travel (miles/month) from Tyson Plant to Americold Facilities                           Americold Facilities in N. Georgia   Lula Gainesville Pendergrass Cartersville   40 25 40 50    In addition, Feed the Children pays for weekly distribution from the Americold facilities it uses to its partners in North Georgia. Those are aggregated into a 7 representative Zip Codes each showing the total weight of food to be delivered each month. These deliveries are smaller in scale and are made in straight trucks without temperature controls costing $2/mile. The distances shown are estimates of the monthly miles requires to reach all the partners in the ZIP Code from the Americold facility. See Table 3 for those weights and distances.

Build a linear Solver model to help Feed the Children distribute food donated by the Tyson Food plant in Cummings, GA via Americold's facilities in Lula, Gainesville, Pendergrass and Cartersville, to serve clients in North Georgia aggregated to 7 ZIP Codes. Be sure to save your model in a clearly marked area of the spreadsheet.

A coffee machine dispenses coffee into paper cups. You're supposed to get 10 ounces of coffee, but the amount varies slightly from cup to cup. Here are the amounts measured in a random sample of 20 cups.  The amounts have a mean of 9.845 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.199 ounces.   Is there evidence that the machine is shortchanging customers?  Use an appropriate formula to create the 95% confidence interval for the mean amount of coffee dispensed in each cup.  Interpret the confidence interval.   Show the appropriate work including formulas.                    9.9       9.7       10.0     10.1     9.9       9.6       9.8       9.8      10.0     9.5                   9.7       10.1     9.9       9.6       10.2     9.8       10.0     9.9       9.5       9.9

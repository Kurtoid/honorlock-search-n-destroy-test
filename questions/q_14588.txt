Module 03 - Motivation: Question: Taylor's decision to move to first base is an example of ______.  Taylor's Backstory: Taylor is an Academic All-American competing in Division 1 Collegiate Softball. Taylor is fascinated by biological processes and enjoys taking courses in her Applied Physiology & Kinesiology major. Taylor is pursuing a pre-med track and hopes to become an orthopedic surgeon after her athletic career ends. Recently, Taylor's coach asked her to move from the catcher position to first-base after the team acquired a graduate transfer who can only play catcher and has a 0.350 career batting average. Taylor prefers to play catcher, but made the move to first-base because she believes she is a team-player and puts the teams interests over her own. Taylor loves competition, and generally enjoys training sessions, except for when her coach makes the team run 100m sprints for every error the team commits in a game. Taylor doesn't believe this is working since the number of errors committed per game has gone up since the coach started adding sprints to practice for each error.

A valid repeated measures ANOVA (rANOVA) was conducted to study the relative effectiveness of three teaching methods used to help third grade students remember vocabulary words. The teaching methods were using flashcards (Method1), completing a worksheet (Method2), and watching an instructional video (Method3). Twenty students were selected, and each student took turns using each one of the three methods to help learn a set of vocabulary words (a Latin square design was used). After a student used an assigned method, he or she took a test over that particular set of vocabulary words. SPSS was used to conduct a repeated measures ANOVA to analyze the vocabulary test scores, and a portion of the SPSS output is provided in the following tables. Refer to the tables as needed to complete this problem. Table 3A    Table 3B    Table 3C    Do the following:  Discuss the result of Mauchly's Test of Sphericity and the implication for the repeated measures ANOVA. State the null and alternative hypotheses for the repeated measures ANOVA test, make a decision about the null hypothesis, and write a conclusion statement. If appropriate, use the Bonferroni post hoc analysis to identify all pairs of treatment means that are statistically significantly different. Justify your conclusions.

Re:  A research team evaluates the effectiveness of a program that provides families with a history of maltreatment with bi-weekly home visits by a social worker. Because this is a program evaluation, it is exempt from IRB review. Participants were informed about the evaluation and asked to participate without going into detail about potential harms, benefits, or privacy of data. The expectation was that the program would show a dramatic reduction in reported child abuse incidents. Instead, the results showed an increase in reported child abuse incidents. The investigators and director were perplexed about this finding but came up with an explanation: There program itself could not possibly have caused an increase in maltreatment, but the increase in reports of abuse is due to closer family monitoring related to the evaluation and services. ------------------------------------------------------------------- The higher rates of CPS referrals for families involved in this study (on account of greater monitoring by the social service system) may be an unintended but troubling consequence.

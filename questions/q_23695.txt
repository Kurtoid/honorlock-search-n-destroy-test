T-tables.pdf  A random sample of 10 university students was surveyed to determine the amount of time spent weekly using a personal computer. The times are: 13, 14, 5, 6, 8, 10, 7, 12, 15, and 3. If the times are normally distributed with a standard deviation of 5.2 hours.    What is the point estimate for the population mean? Calculate the standard error For a .01 level of significance find the margin of error Find the 99% confidence interval  Interpret the confidence interval.

(Continues from the preceding question.) About one-third of persons with HCM show abnormal blood pressure regulation during exercise, causing a decrease in MAP. This results in part from a large fall in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) during exercise, which appears to be caused at least in part by inappropriate responses in blood vessels of non-exercising muscle. In a typical person without cardiovascular disease, an increase in cardiac output with exercise from 5 L/min to 15 L/min may be associated with an increase in MAP from 95 mm Hg to 105 mm Hg. In this case, the total systemic vascular resistance during exercise must have [SVR] compared to the SVR at rest. According to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, if the resistance to flow in a blood vessel falls by 50% due to a change in blood vessel diameter, the diameter must have [SVR2]. Therefore, if the problem with SVR during exercise in persons with HCM is due to the responses of blood vessels in non-exercising muscle, these vessels must inappropriately [ExerciseResponse] during exercise.

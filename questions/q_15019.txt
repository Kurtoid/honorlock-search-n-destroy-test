The production manager for the Electric Sandal Corporation is in the process of setting up next week's production schedule for sandals so as to maximize gross profit for the week given available resources.  Two types of sandals can be made, Type A and Type B, which yield a gross profit of $50 and $40 each, respectively.  Type A sandals require 3 hours of a worker's time, Type B requires 1.5 hours.

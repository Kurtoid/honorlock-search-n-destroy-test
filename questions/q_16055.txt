As a radiographer, you are using a DR system that displays EI#'s as part of the DICOM header. The EI#s are calculated as directly proportional and linear to exposure. The image you have created shows marginal quantum noise and an EI# of 140. The exposure technique you used was 85 kVp@ 15 mAs. To improve image quality and eliminate the objectionable noise, your next step should be to
You are staining lymph node cells with PE-labeled (red) antibodies specific for T cell receptor (a marker for all T cells), and FITC-labeled (green) antibodies specific for surface IgM. The mice used in your experiment are mice deficient in Artemis. Select all the quadrant(s) where you expect to see significant numbers of cells in the lymph node cells derived from Artemis-deficient mice.

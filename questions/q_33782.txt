Orion Inc. is in the business of selling toys to local toy stores.  Orion's customers have placed orders for the hot new toy of the holiday season, Chip - the Robot Dog.  In total, Orion's customers have ordered 500 toy dogs.   On December 1, 2016, Orion called CRD Inc., the seller of Chip - the Robot Dog, and verbally ordered 500 toy dogs at a price of $20 per dog.  The CRD sales representative told Orion that the dogs would be shipped on December 5 with payment due upon delivery.   On December 2 Orion sent a signed, written purchase order to CRD via email (which is how Orion had submitted purchase orders to CRD in the past) ordering 500 toy dogs at $20 per dog.  In the email to CRD, Orion stated the following: "Attached is a purchase order which confirms our order yesterday."  On December 4 CRD was informed that there would be a shortage of toy dogs this season and that it could obtain substantially more than $20 per toy dog.  CRD did not ship the toy dogs to Orion on December 5 and ignored subsequent phone calls from Orion demanding immediate delivery.  CRD never responded to Orion, never responded to the purchase order sent by Orion, and has now refused to ship any toy dogs to Orion.  Which of the following is correct?

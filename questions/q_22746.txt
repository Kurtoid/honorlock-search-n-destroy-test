In the Matter and Phase Changes simulation, you helped Jo who live in a place that has a limited fuel supply  to produce in a more efficient way, more bioethanol. In order to help her, you first mastered the definition of matter and the process of phase changes. You then dived into the water and examined the dynamics of intermolecular forces of water molecules during the phase changes.  In this simulation holograms and virtual instruments were used to illustrate the phase transitions experienced by water and the purification of ethanol.  Based on your virtual experience complete the following explanation and questions: a) Explain in your own words what is the role played by the intermolecular forces and kinetic energy (temperature) on the physical state adopted by water or any other type of matter. b) Explain what phase transition takes place during the process known as condensation and how the intermolecular forces and the temperature act to favor this type of phase transition. c) Why, in a heating curve, does the temperature remain constant during a phase change? d) Write the name of the different parts of a distillation equipment that have been labeled in the attached figure. e) Explain in general how this virtual experiment helped you to understand the meaning of the zones shown in the heating curve (see the figure above), the role of the intermolecular forces, and the effect of pressure and temperature on the efficiency of the distillation of ethanol.

Read the following paragraph carefully. Then answer numbers 16-18. 1All of Horace Smith's attempts at producing popular fiction have been notable failures. 2His first novel, This Side of Yonkers, was rejected by every publisher, including most of the vanity presses. 3He fared no better after writing his second, Tender is the Subway. 4In fact, local and state governments nationwide passed resolutions calling upon the President to deport him. 5Smith's third and fourth novels resulted in legislation making it a federal crime to sell him paper and writing instruments. 6The Beautiful and the Dank is Smith's most recent attempt at winning the hearts of his countrymen. 7This novel, the author states, taps the nation's very soul. 8He claims on the dust jacket that this work places him in the pantheon of America's greatest writers. 9In reality, The Beautiful and the Dank is only another in Smith's already-too-long line of miserable failures.

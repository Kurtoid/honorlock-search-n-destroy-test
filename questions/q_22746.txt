[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).] You are investigating a crash scene and there are no human witnesses.  The defendant claims that they were not speeding at all, and that the car just magically started skidding and then crashed into the parked cars on the other side of the road.  The posted speed limit is 35 mph here (which is = 15.6 m/s).  It just stopped raining.  The road curve has a radius of curvature = 40 meters at this location, and you can see skid marks on the road leading to the crash site.  The driver was in a brand new Alpha Romero 4C Spider which has a mass of 1128 Kg.  The Coefficient of Kinetic friction for rubber on dry concrete is 0.5, and for wet concrete it is 0.7.  The Coefficient of Static friction for rubber on dry concrete is 1.0, and for wet concrete it is 0.7.  The acceleration of gravity is -9.8 m/s^2. a. Calculate the maximum safe rated speed for this turn without skidding, in km/h. b. How does this prove that the driver was telling the truth or not?  How fast were they going?

Read the following scenario and answer the question(s) below.Thousands of young families moved "over the hills" and into the San Fernando Valley, a suburb of Los Angeles, after World War II.

Ringed by beautiful mountains, the entire Los Angeles basin looked like a new, green, sun-filled paradise to the families seeking a fresh start. In the early 1950s, one of the common family chores in Los Angeles was to carry the trash out to the stone incinerator behind the garage where each family burned all of their dry trash. "Wet" garbage was collected and taken to a city dump, where it was burned by the city. Everyone throughout the city either used an incinerator or burned things in an open trash pile; there were over 400,000 backyard trash incinerators. On warm afternoons, eyes would sometimes sting and burn. People would stop, close their eyes, and let the cleansing tears refresh irritated eyes. They accepted this as a normal part of life in sunny California.One key to the puzzle of Los Angeles's smog is the fact that ________.

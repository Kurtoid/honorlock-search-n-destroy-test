Question 40 (2 points) Melissa is very jealous of Amanda, who is dating Melissa's ex-boyfriend and who is potentially going to take Melissa's starting spot on their college soccer team. Melissa wants to make sure that Amanda won't be healthy enough to play when the season starts. During their July "team-building" camping trip, while hiking along a narrow path through the mountains, Melissa pretends to trip and "accidentally" pushes Amanda off the path and over a rocky ledge. Amanda only falls about ten feet, but she breaks her neck, is paralyzed, and dies from complications four weeks later. Melissa did not want Amanda to die, and she did not think that there was any chance Amanda would die from the fall. (She was hoping for something like a broken leg or arm.) Melissa is overcome with guilt and remorse and admits afterward that she purposely pushed Amanda over the ledge and why she did so.   Could Melissa be properly convicted of "malice murder" under the traditional common law approach? Why or why not? (1-3 sentences)

You need to use the Appendix to keep track of any changes to the ARP tables yourself, as each event occurs.    Bigger view of network diagram and starting ARP tables. Overview: Questions in the case study can be generic questions or questions related to one of the events.    Event 1: A talks to B Event 2: E talks to D Event 3: D talks to C Event 4: F talks to A Event 5: B talks to C    From Event 5: B talks to C, based on the state of the ARP tables after events 1-4, how many frames are sent on the network, for B to successfully communicate with C?

I try to label as clearly as possible.  Don't talk about or post about the exam until the professor says it is ok to do so (honor code violation).  Piazza should be shut down for the period of the exam to reduce inadvertent posting. For this exam, you are allowed a pencil/pen and a blank sheet of paper to work out problems.  You are NOTallowed a calculator nor any other notes, books, or other reference materials (written nor web-based).

You only get 1 submission! So make sure you are finished when you submit.  Choose the BEST answer!

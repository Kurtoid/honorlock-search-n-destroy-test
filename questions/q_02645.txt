The figure illustrates an Atwood Machine with a rotating pulley. The blocks have mass of 3.0 kg and 5.7 kg, and the pulley has a radius of  0.12 m and a mass of 10.2 kg. Find the tension in each side of the cord and the angular acceleration of the pulley assuming that there is no slipping between the cord and the surface of the pulley.

You have just obtained blood from a patient breathing room air to determine ABG results.  As you run the blood through the blood gas analyzer, you notice you failed to remove an air bubble from the sample.  The blood gas results will most likely reflect values with a:
You are interested in understanding the gene regulation of LKP1, a protein that is normally produced in liver and kidney cells in mice. Interestingly, you find that the lkp1 gene is not expressed in heart cells. You isolate the DNA upstream of the lkp1 gene, place it upstream of the gene for green fluorescent protein (gfp), and insert this entire piece of recombinant DNA into mice. You find GFP expressed in liver and kidney cells but not in heart cells, an expression pattern similar to the normal expression of the lkp1 gene. Further experiments demonstrate that there are three regions in the promoter, labeled A, B, and C in the below Figure that contribute to this expression pattern. Assume that a single and unique transcription factor binds each site such that protein X binds site A, protein Y binds site B, and protein Z binds site C. You want to determine which region is responsible for tissue-specific expression, and create mutations in the promoter to determine the function of each of these regions. In the below figure, if the site is missing, it is mutated such that it cannot bind its corresponding transcription factor.  C. Which of these statements is LEAST supported by the data?

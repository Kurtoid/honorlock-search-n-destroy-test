31. Suppose that an appraiser has come to the following conclusions in evaluating the subject property. Due to the dramatic shift in the perceived safety of the neighborhood, values of any residential properties in the area of the subject property have fallen by $10,000, on average. Due to the subject property's age, physical deterioration to the building accounts for an estimate of $50,000 in lost value.

You are running a mammography screening program in a van that travels around your health district. A 45-year-old woman has a mammogram. The study is interpreted as "suspicious for malignancy" by the radiologist. The patient asks you: "Does this mean I have cancer?", and you (correctly) answer "No, we have to do further testing." She then asks, "OK, I understand that the mammogram isn't the final answer, but given what we know now, what are the chances that I have breast cancer?"  Assume that the overall risk of breast cancer in any 45-year-old woman, regardless of mammogram result, is 0.1% or one in a thousand. Imagine: 10,000 women, 0.1% of whom have cancer: 9,990 women without cancer 10 women with cancer 8 women with a positive mammogram who have cancer 2 woman with a negative mammogram who has cancer 9490 women with a negative mammogram who do not have cancer 500 women with a positive mammogram who do not have cancer   What is the test's specificity? Include the formula, calculation and answer.

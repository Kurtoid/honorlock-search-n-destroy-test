Max Powers is a great quarterback. He is a Junior and is deciding whether he wants to come back and play his Senior year at FSU. Scouts have told him he currently holds a 2nd round NFL draft grade which means that if he enters the draft he can expect to earn $5 million dollars. But, they tell him if he comes back for his Senior season he could become a 1st round NFL draft pick and would earn $12 million dollars. Max knows that nothing in life is guaranteed. He figures there is a 10 percent chance he gets injured in his Senior season, is never the same kind of player, and never makes it to the NFL. Assume in that case he is paid zero dollars. There is a 40 percent chance he doesn't improve his draft stock at all, and a 50 percent chance he becomes a first round pick. Based on those numbers, if Max only pays attention to expected value (i.e. he is risk neutral), should he come back for his Senior season?

Figures show the TTT diagrams for the precipitation reactions in Al-5.5% Mg and Al-4% Cu. When solution hardening the Al-Mg alloy, it is only necessary to cool the metal moderately quickly (~180 s from the solution treatment temperature to room temperature). However, when quenching the Al-Cu alloy prior to age hardening, it is necessary to quench the metal very rapidly into cold water or oil (~15 s from the solution treatment temperature to room temperature). Explain why one needs to have this large difference in cooling rate.

Innovation Products International (IPI) is a health foods company which recently discovered that increased soy isoflavones (at least 500 mg every 2 days) in a person's diet has been able to extend a person's life span by at least 20 years.  The company developed a new product called "Soy for Life" which is a tasty breakfast bar that contains 500 mg of soy isoflavones in each bar.  Cost of research and development for the product was $3,500,000.  The breakfast bar market size is currently measured at 100 million units of which IPI serves 75%. Initial taste tests concluded that consumers are unable to make any taste distinctions between a regular breakfast bar and one that contains 500 mg of isoflavones. IPI plans to launch this new breakfast bar initially across the United States using its current distribution channel of supermarket chains and health food stores which have 5,000 locations combined.  The company then plans to expand the product market area to include South America, Europe and Asia and also intends to setup manufacturing plants in these expanded market areas.  Innovation Product International's fixed cost is currently at $1 million per year with the total cost to produce each breakfast bar at $1.55.  The finding of several research studies has determined that consumers would be willing to pay $12.25 for "Soy for Life" breakfast at which the retail selling price would be targeted.  The retailer's margin is 30%, the wholesaler's margin is 15%. (Round partial units upward.  Round percentages to one decimal point.  Round currency to dollars and cents.)

The monosaccharide D-ribose can exist in an open-chain and a ring form (referred to as D-ribopyranose, shown below). When the open chain form of D-ribose is converted to the ring form, a new chiral center (referred to as the anomeric carbon) is formed. This produces two stereoisomers: the a-anomer and the b-anomer of D-ribopyranose (shown below).  In the MOST stable chair form of D-ribopyranose, would the bolded OH group (also indicated with a solid arrow) be axial or equatorial? You can disregard the anomeric OH group to answer this question. [axeq] Which of the two anomers of D-ribopyranose is MORE stable? Note that the more stable anomer can assume the more stable chair conformation. [stableanomer] Which of the following options best describes the isomeric relationship between the two anomers of D-ribopyranose? [relationship]

(A) What is a cancer stem cell? (B) Describe two ways cancer stem cells can arise.  (C) Why does the presence of cancer stem cells in a tumor make it harder to effectively treat the tumor? (D). you want to determine if a new type of treatment is effective against cancer stem cells but first you have to obtain cancer stem cells to use in your assays for drug sensitivity. How would you (i) isolate cancer stem cells from a solid tumor and (ii) prove that the cells you isolated are true cancer stem cells?

Suppose that you release a small ball from rest at some depth below the surface of a pool of water. You repeat the same experiment for a pool of oil. The density of the ball is [p1] that of water, and [p2] that of oil. Assume that the drag force on the ball from the fluids is negligible. If the ball reaches a velocity m/s when emerging from the water, and a velocity  m/s when emerging from the oil, what is ? (Neglect any transfer of energy to the splashing and waves produced by the emerging ball.)

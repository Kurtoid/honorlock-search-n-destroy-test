At the beginning of the year Apple's management is considering making an offer to buy Mango Corporation. Mango's projected operating income (EBIT) for the current year is $100 million, but Apple believes that if the two firms were merged, it could consolidate some operations, reduce Mango's expenses, and raise Mango's EBIT to $120 million. Neither company uses any debt, both pay income taxes at a 30% rate. Apple has a better reputation among investors, who regard it as better managed and also less risky, so Apple's stock has a P/E ratio of 20 versus a P/E of 10 for Mango. Since Apple's management will be running the entire enterprise after a merger, investors will value the resulting corporation based on Apple's P/E. Based on expected market values, how much synergy should the merger create?

Name 1 purpose of a pressure dressing
Three 3 phase loads are connected in parallel. One is a purely resistive load connected in wye. It consumes 300kW. The second is a purely inductive 300kVAR load connected in wye. The third is a purely capacitive 300kVAR load connected in wye. The line -to-line voltage at the load is 5kV. A 3 phase distribution line supplying this load has an impedance of 10+j5 ohms per phase.  (a) Calculate the currents drawn by each load (magnitude and phase). (b) Indicate the power factor of each load. Remember that non - unity power factors must also include whether they are lagging or leading. (c) What is the power factor of the entire load?  (d) Calculate the real and reactive power absorbed by the loads.

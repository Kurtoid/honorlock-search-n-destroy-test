A patient filed a medical malpractice action against a doctor in federal district court. The doctor timely filed a motion to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction. Following a hearing, the court found that it had personal jurisdiction over the doctor and denied the motion. The doctor then filed its answer. In addition to responding to the patient's allegations and raising affirmative defenses, the doctor moved to dismiss the action, alleging that the patient failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The court held a hearing on that motion and denied that motion as well. The parties then conducted discovery for approximately a year, and the case was set for trial. As the trial was about to begin, the doctor discovered that the patient had moved to State A, where the doctor was domiciled, prior to filing suit. The patient concealed this fact from his attorney. The doctor thus filed a motion to dismiss the action on the grounds that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. How should the court rule on the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction?

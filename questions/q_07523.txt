A) The enzyme that breaks down maltose has a specifically shaped active site, and lactose won't fit.                                                                  B) The enzyme that facilitates the breakdown of maltose is used up in the reaction that breaks down this sugar into its subunits.                  C) The sequence of monosaccharides that make up the enzyme allows only one substrate to bind to one specifically shaped enzyme.            D) It would.

Optional Extra Credit: When writing this exam, I attempted to effectively cover material that we have learned this quarter. But with the limitations of a 2 hour exam, you have assuredly studied and learned a lot more than I could possibly cover in this exam! Please consider a topic you reviewed that I didn't ask you about on this exam, and tell me about that topic here! Please don't stress - this is your chance to show me you learned something from this course by telling me about it - i.e., this is meant to be a very gentle last question on this exam! :) If you can't think of anything you studied that I didn't cover, or you think I covered everything, please instead just pick any topic you learned well and briefly explain it to me. Please write a minimum of a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) explaining your single topic in complete sentences (not bullet points). You may of course go longer if you wish and have time.

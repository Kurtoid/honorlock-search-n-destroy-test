A sheet of metal with a length of 1.5 m and width of 2 m is placed on the surface of a wooden table. A 0.0015 m thick dielectric cotton tablecloth with a permittivity of 4.8x10-11 C2/Nm2 is laid on top of the metal sheet and another identical metal plate is placed on the first piece of metal. Each plate is hooked up to opposite terminals of a 12 V car battery.    a) What is the charge that develops on the capacitor plates? b) How much energy is stored by the capacitor? c) Calculate the strength of the electric field between the capacitor plates.   Suddenly a large punch bowl is spilled on the table soaking the tablecloth and changing the permittivity of the cloth to 7.7x10-10 C2/Nm2. Answer the following questions assuming the cloth is soaked as described. d)How much charge is on the plates now. e) Find the energy stored by the capacitor when the tablecloth is soaked. f)Now the metal plates are disconnected from the battery. If the cloth dries overnight returning the tablecloth to its original condition, then calculate the energy stored in the capacitor the next day. g)What is the new potential difference the next day?   part a) 1. Write the number to the left of the equation from the list of numbered formula that allows you to calculate the capacitance two parallel plates in a vacuum.

A nurse is performing an integumentary assessment on a patient.  Which findings should the nurse recognize as requiring immediate intervention?
It may be helpful to draw a picture of the following scenario in order to answer this question. Neurons A, B and C are presynaptic neurons which all synapse on the soma of neuron X.  Neurons A and B each cause an EPSP resulting in 5mV depolarization at the axon hillock.  Neuron C generates an IPSP causing a 3mV hyperpolarization at the axon hillock.  Neuron X's Vm is -70mV and its threshold is -65mV.  Which of the following would be false?

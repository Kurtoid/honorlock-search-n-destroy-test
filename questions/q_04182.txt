The principal of the school suspends a student - after the student comes to school wearing (1) a baseball cap that says "F_ _k" and (2) a T-shirt with the words "All Authority Figures (continued from baseball cap)." As soon as a school administrator notices the student, the administrator tells the student "You can't wear a hat with a curse word on it" and then asks the student to turn the cap over to the administrator, which the student does (but while protesting that it is a violation of the student's constitutional rights). However, the student then continues - throughout the school day - to wear the T-shirt that says "All Authority Figures (continued from baseball cap)." Many other students - who had seen, or heard about, the student's baseball cap - loudly say "F_ _k All Authority Figures!" or "F_ _ k the Principal!" as the student walks by. The school then demands that the student change shirts or wear another article of clothing over the T-shirt, and suspends the student when the student refuses.(Please address both level of scrutiny or other test that might apply both with respect to (i) the prohibition on the student's wearing the baseball cap and (ii) the prohibition on the student's continuing to wear the T-shirt).

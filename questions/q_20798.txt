Attraction Corporation produces specially machined parts. The parts are produced in batches in one continuous manufacturing process. Each part is custom produced and requires special engineering design activity (based on customer specifications). Once the design is completed, the equipment can be set up for batch production.

Thus, the manufacturing process has four activities: engineering, setups, machining, and inspecting. In addition, there is a sustaining process with two activities: providing utilities (plantwide) and providing space. Costs have been assigned to each activity using direct tracing and resource drivers:     Engineering   $1,000,000     Setups   900,000     Machining   2,000,000     Inspection   800,000     Providing space   250,000     Providing utilities   180,000      Activity drivers for each activity have been identified and their practical capacities listed:     Machine hours   25,000     Setups   200     Engineering hours   5,000     Inspection hours   2,500      The costs of facility-level activities are assigned using machine hours.

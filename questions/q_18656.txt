A nurse is entering information on the patient's electronic health record (EHR) and is called to assist in an emergency situation with regard to another patient in the labor and birth suite. The nurse rushes to the scene to assist; however, she leaves the chart open on the computer screen.

Which response by the nurse indicates that she understands the nurse manager's concerns?
The period of a pendulum is the time it takes the pendulum to swing back and forth once. If the only dimensional quantities that the period depends on are the acceleration of gravity, g, and the length of the pendulum, L, what combination of g and L must the period be proportional to?
Give a tight bound of the nearest runtime complexity class for each of the following code fragments in Big-Oh notation, in terms of the variable N. In other words, write the code's growth rate as N grows. Write a simple expression that gives only a power of N using a caret ^ character for exponentiation, such as O(N^2) to represent O(N2) or O(log N) to represent O(log2 N). Do not write an exact calculation of the runtime such as O(2N3 + 4N + 14).     // a) vector v; for (int i = 1; i

DNA replication can stall as a consequence of the replication machinery encountering hairpin DNA structures that can form due to inverted repeats and palindromic sequences.  When DNA replication stalls, double-strand breaks in the DNA can occur, causing severe genetic and cellular consequences.  Both Werner syndrome (premature onset of age-related phenotypes and cancer) and Bloom syndrome (cancer) are the result of mutations in helicase, an enzyme that unwinds hairpin structures.  Helicase MOST likely breaks which type of bonds in a hairpin?

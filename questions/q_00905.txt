JoyCo Educational Industries is considering the addition of a new product to its current offerings, a portable device that will maintain a constant connection to a school's online resources and infrastructure without requiring the user to obtain an internet connection through a third party. The device is intended for distribution to low-income students who would otherwise have no way of accessing coursework and resources when off-campus. While it is expected that the device would work well for connecting under-privileged students to educational resources, it may be prohibitively expensive for schools to maintain the cellular connectivity necessary to the functionality of the device. Thus, the success of the new product is somewhat uncertain. To begin the project, JoyCo must invest $2,250,000 in new equipment to support production of the device and requisite software. Setup and installation of the new equipment will cost the firm another $45,000 and it is expected to have a useful life of 8 years. Management believes that the equipment can be salvaged for $350,000 at the end of 8 years. The IRS allows assets such as these to be depreciated over a 7-year recovery period. The applicable yearly MACRS depreciation rates are given in the table below. In addition, because of extra necessary inventory and expected increases in accounts receivable, the firm will have to maintain net operating working capital of 13% of the next year's expected sales. Thus, the initial investment in working capital will occur in year 0 and additional investments in working capital will be required on a yearly basis as sales are expected to increase. The total investment in working capital will be recovered in the last year of the project, year 8. Beginning in year 1, JoyCo believes that it can produce new the product at a cost of $190 per device and sell each device for $200. The first year, unit sales are expected to be 200,000. As awareness and adoption rates across K-12 and universities increase, unit sales are expected to increase by 5% per year thereafter. One of the drawbacks of the new product is that because schools do not have unlimited resources, they may invest less in other educational products sold by JoyCo to support investments in the device. Thus, JoyCo expects to lose sales of around $400,000 per year on its other products as a result. The new project will require additional non-variable costs of $250,000 beginning in year 1. Variable and non-variable costs as well as the sales price per unit are expected to rise by 2.5% per year as a result of inflation. The new production line must be housed in a building that is currently leased by another business for $60,000 a year. The lease on the building has just expired, but the tenant is willing to renew the lease for another 8 years at the same annual price. JoyCo's tax rate is 35% and the project's cost of capital is 8.25%, on par with the firm's WACC. Because there is some uncertainty regarding the success of the new product, management would like to see some analysis on a best-case and worst-case scenario. Under the best-case scenario, assume that the equipment cost is $1,950,000, and in year 1 the cost per unit is $185, the sales price per unit is $210, unit sales are 225,000, and non-variable costs are $235,000. After year 1, unit sales will grow by 6.5% per year, variable and non-variable costs will grow by 2% per year and the sales price per unit will grow by 3% per year. Finally, assume that the sales loss on other products is $350,000 (rather than $400,000 under the base case) and that the firm's tax rate is 30%. Under the worst-case scenario, assume that the equipment cost is $2,500,000, and in year 1 the cost per unit is $195, the sales price per unit is $197, unit sales are 175,000, and non-variable costs are $265,000. After year 1, unit sales will grow by 3.5% per year, variable and non-variable costs will grow by 3% per year and the sales price per unit will grow by 2% per year. Finally, assume that the sales loss on other products is $650,000 (rather than $500,000 under the base case) and that the firm's tax rate is 40%. Below is the 7-year MACRS depreciation rate table.     7-year MACRS Recovery Period     Year   MACRS Rate     1   14.29%     2   24.49%     3   17.49%     4   12.49%     5   8.93%     6   8.92%     7   8.93%     8   4.46%     For each of the questions, do your work in the appropriately labeled figure.  In Figure 2, Compute the yearly project cash flows under the original set of assumptions. You should set up this part of the analysis using the Scenario Manager for the inputs (in Figure 1). Name this scenario "Base Case." (15 points)  Using these cash flows, compute each of the following for the project (12 points):  NPV IRR MIRR Profitability Index Payback Period Discounted Payback Period   In Figure 3, perform a sensitivity analysis of the project's NPV by varying the cost of the equipment, unit sales beginning in year 1, sales price per unit, and variable cost per unit by +/-10% from the base case assumptions:  Create separate one-input data tables for each input listed above, showing the input value at -10%, -5%, 0%, +5% and +10% variations from the base assumption and the resulting NPV. (10 points)  In the space below Figure 3, create a sensitivity graph showing the different values for NPV under the various deviations from the base case for each input listed above.(20 points)  The Chart Title should be "NPV Sensitivity Analysis" The vertical axis should show the NPVs and the title should be "NPV ($)" while the horizontal axis title is "% Deviation from Base" The minimum value for the vertical axis should be -$21,000,000 and the maximum value should be $21,000,000, with 3,000,000 major units. The minimum value for the horizontal axis should be -20% and the maximum 20% with 5% major units. The vertical and horizontal axes should intersect at -$21,000,000 on the vertical axis and -20% on the horizontal axis. Label each "line" (or series) as we did in class, "Equipment," "Price/Unit," "Units," and "VC/Unit."       Now assume that management would like to see a best- and worst-case scenario to go along with the base case you have just completed.  Calculate the yearly project cash flows for the best- and worst-cases. You should set up the inputs for the best- and worst-case scenarios using the Scenario Manager. (15 points)  Generate a Scenario Summary (which will result in a new worksheet) for each case (base, best and worst) that shows results for the project's yearly cash flows, NPV, IRR, MIRR, Profitability Index, Payback Period and Discounted Payback Period. (10 points)  Be sure to appropriately label the Changing Cells and Results Cells in the Scenario Summary table that you created so that the table is easy to read (for example, instead of having a reference to E8 in the table, it should show the appropriate label, "Equipment Cost").   Copy the cash flows for the base case, best- and worst-cases into Figure 4 and compute NPVs for each scenario in that figure. Assume that there is a 50% probability that the base case occurs, and a 25% probability of being in either the best or worst cases. Compute the project's expected NPV, and standard deviation of NPV. (10 points)    In the P5 worksheet, answer the following question: What is a Monte Carlo simulation? Generally describe what steps are involved as it pertains to what we've done with it in capital budgeting. How is it used for risk analysis in capital budgeting and what useful information can we obtain from running a simulation?

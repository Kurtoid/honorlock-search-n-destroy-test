Let S(n) be a statement parameterized by a positive integer n. Consider a proof that uses strong induction to prove that for all n>=10, S(n) is true. The base case proves that S(10), S(11), S(12) are all true. Select the correct expressions to complete the statement of what is assumed and proven in the inductive step. Supposed that for k>=(1?) , S(j) is true for every j in the range 10 through k. Then we will show that (2?) is true.

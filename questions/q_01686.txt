A patient who suffered facial burns and smoke inhalation has recovered enough to be extubated.  Although the patient patient is receiving 40% oxygen with a bland aerosol, significant stridor is noticed within 15 minutes.  Following the inhalation of a vasoconstricting medication, the patient's breath sounds are improved.  Thirty minutes later the patient's Sp02 level is 80% and the inspiratory stridor is more serious.  The patient is very anxious and is pulling off the oxygen mask.  What should the respiratory therapist recommend to best manage the patient's problem?

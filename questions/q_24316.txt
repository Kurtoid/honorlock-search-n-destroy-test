Select ONE of the following questions. Be sure to answer each part of the selected question and be sure to be specific in your answers--leave no room for vagueness, as this may be interpreted as a lack of understanding and could result in a failing score.   Option 1: Applying Concepts to Research Design You have been tasked with developing a research proposal evaluating the relationship between social class and educational outcomes in the state of Missouri. Thinking about this relationship, you should consider the best methodological approach (qualitative or quantitative methods); a measurable research question; how you may gather your sample and how to ensure the protection of your research subjects. For each point below, explain in detail (utilizing material gained in the course) how you would approach this project, addressing the following questions: -1. Which methodological approach (qualitative or quantitative) would you select and why? How might the project differ if you were to select the alternative methodology? -2. What is your research question? How will your selection of methods seek to answer this question? -3. What potential errors may arise in your research and how can you attempt to control for these errors? Be specific using the terminology provided in coursework. -4. What type(s) of sampling strategies would you use? Explain your reasoning for the use of the strategy. Again, be specific and show your knowledge. -5. Discuss in detail how you would uphold research ethics in the form of protection of subjects, using the ethical issues discussed in the course.   Option 2: Theory and Methods As we have learned, the standpoint of the researcher can influence how a researcher may approach their study. Considering the research proposal below, discuss how Critical Social Science (CSS), Positivist Social Science (PSS) and Interpretive Social Science (ISS) would differ, be careful to illustrate your understanding for each approach in the following research proposal: Proposal: Evaluate the relationship between social class and educational outcomes in Missouri: For this question: -1. Detail how the guiding questions would differ among the three approaches for the proposed study. -2. Describe the methodologies that would be utilized by each approach. -3. Explain how each approach would influence the direction and findings of the following proposed study.   Option 3: General Methods -1 Compare and contrast qualitative and quantitative methods, what are the benefits and drawbacks of each? -2. What are potential errors that can arise in Qualitative Methods? What strategies can researchers utilize to avoid these errors? -3. What are potential errors that can arise in Quantitative Methods? What strategies can researchers utilize to avoid these errors?  Finally, how might utilizing a mixed methods approach be a benefit to researchers when confronting issues of validity and reliability? Be very careful to explain the concepts of validity and reliability, in the discussion of mixed methodology.

Write a Python program to manage a dictionary of pizza sizes and their number of inches.  Prompt the user for pizza size and its number of inches.  If the pizza size is 'done', stop adding to the dictionary Otherwise add to a dictionary.  The key should be the pizza size and the value should be the number of inches Note that pizza sizes should be converted to all uppercase, even if not entered in uppercase  Prompt the user for a pizza size to look up in the dictionary   If the pizza size is in the dictionary, print the number of inches  Otherwise, print 'Not found'     You MUST use a dictionary to manage the collection of pizzas You MUST use string functions to parse the input from the user.  Both the pizza size and number of inches will be entered on a single line separated by whitespace  Please copy the following code to the Answer box and then fill in your code.  This will preserve your indentation/formatting.  Because indentation is critical in Python, make sure that the code in the answer box is following the indentation that you want #!/usr/bin/env python3# TBD - write code here Sample Run #1 (bold, underlined text is what the user types): size diameter? small 8size diameter? medium 10size diameter? large 12size diameter? doneSize to find? large12 Sample Run #2 (bold, underlined text is what the user types): size diameter? medium 10size diameter? large 12size diameter? doneSize to find? smallNot found Pay close attention to your indentation when you are entering your answer!

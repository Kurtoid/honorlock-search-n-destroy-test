Unbeknownst to the girlfriend, the con man had stolen a wallet from a customer at the gas station convenience store that they had stopped at a few towns back. Before the officer came up to the car, the con man told his girlfriend, "Hold my wallet for me, will you?" The girlfriend put the wallet in her purse, saying, "O.K., but I don't want to know why." Before the officer even told the couple why he had stopped the minivan, the con man blurted out, "She's the one who took the wallet," pointing at his girlfriend.

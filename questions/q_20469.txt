This is a multi-part free-response question. Write down your answers on a piece of blank paper. Show your answer to your camera for a few seconds once you're done. Within 10 minutes after you have completed the entire exam in Honorlock, scan all your hand-written answers and send to Dr. Xue (jxue@mse.ufl.edu).   Semiconductor Heterojunction (22 total points) The band gaps of CdSe and CdTe are 1.70 eV and 1.56 eV, respectively.  Their electron affinities are 4.95 eV and 4.28 eV, respectively.  CdSe is doped into p-type, and an isotype heterojunction is formed between CdSe and CdTe.  Assuming in both semiconductors, the Fermi level is 0.2 eV away from the nearest band edge.  Please calculate the valence and conduction band offsets at the CdSe/CdTe heterojunction using Anderson's Electron Affinity Rule. (4 points) Please specify the type of band alignment for this heterojunction. (3 points) Please draw the equilibrium band diagram of this heterojunction as accurately as possible, and identify the charge accumulation and/or depletion regions on the band diagram. (6 points) What is the total band bending in the two semiconductors when the heterojunction is under thermal equilibrium? (3 points) Please discuss how the current flows under forward and reverse bias conditions.  Specify the polarity of the biases applied to the two sides of the heterojunction and specify what types of carriers contribute to the current. (6 points)

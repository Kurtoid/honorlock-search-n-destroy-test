The next phase is the [6](6) phase which is characterized by growth of the follicle and the uterus. During this second phase [7] (7: hormone/s) is/are released from the follicle at low but rising levels and this provides [8](8: R or S) feedback to the [11](11) gland for the release of [12](12: hormone/s). The next phase occurs on day [13](13: put the number in), in this phase[14](14: hormone) levels being released from the follicle get so high that they cause[15] (15: R or S) feedback to the gland that releases [16](16: one hormone), this hormone leads to rupture of the follicle and release of the egg.

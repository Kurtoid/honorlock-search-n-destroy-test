10. Read the article, written by one of the children from the kindertransport, many years later.  (5)                   A New Home - by Irene Katzenstein Schmied   On a Friday afternoon in early April 1939, I stood with my mother on a platform at Victoria Station. Several ladies seemed to be hovering around us. Perhaps one of them would be Mrs. Muirhead. My mother--just arrived in England and working as a domestic--could not have me with her, nor did my previous hosts want to keep me. I needed somewhere to stay.                 Almost three months had passed since I had arrived in England on a Kindertransport. Child that I was, I only remembered childish things about the trip over, such as the delicious cocoa at the Jewish Domestic Science School in Hamburg where we stopped for lunch before boarding the ship, the HMS Manhattan. That evening I listened, spellbound, to the stories of farewells told by my glamorous and far more grown-up cabin mates: Would they ever see their parents, boyfriends, again? At least I knew that my mother would soon join me in England. The next evening's debarkation in Southampton led to a trip on a double-decker bus to the sound of the rain and the drumming of tree branches on the roof. Breakfast at our overnight accommodation --a school, or possibly a hostel-- brought the first taste of porridge (from then on "comfort food") steaming under a blanket of brown sugar. A train ride to London followed. Tante Hilde (a friend of my parents) met me and whisked me off in a taxi to Turners Wood in Hampstead. Annelie, once my best friend in Berlin, came out to greet me.                 Imagine you are Irene Schmied. You are one of the children evacuated with the Kindertransport.  After many months you are about to be reunited with your family. As you pack your bags to return to your home, you think about the things you want to tell your mother when you see her.  Write a short paragraph of no more than 75 words. You should mention:  1.     what you saw on the way to your new home (2) 2.     how you felt when you arrived at your new home (1) 3.    how you were treated at your new home (2)

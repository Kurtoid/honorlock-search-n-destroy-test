Consider three advanced processors:   processor X has a CPI of 0.5 and a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz processor Y has a CPI of 0.25 and a clock frequency of 2.8 GHz processor Z has a CPI of 0.25 and a clock frequency of 4 GHz.   (a) Which of these three processors is most likely to have the smallest depth pipeline? Why? (b) Assume that processor Y has a pipeline depth of 10 stages and an issue width of 4. If there are no branch mispredictions and no data dependences, what is the expected performance improvement over a 1-issue processor with the classical 5-stage pipeline? Assume that the clock cycle time decreases in proportion to the number of pipeline stages.

Questions 11 to 20 refer to the following case: Miss J is 17 years old. She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) 5 years ago and has been prescribed insulin as a basal-bolus regimen to help achieve glycaemic control (insulin glargine 18 units once daily at evening time; insulin lispro 1-5 units at meal times according to carbohydrate intake). She has struggled with the perceived stigma of diabetes and objects to having to inject herself on multiple occasions each day. This has made achieving a good level adherence difficult.   For several weeks she has been very sporadic with her insulin self-administration and over the past several days has not used any insulin at all.   Question: At home Miss J. is beginning to show behavioural changes; she is drowsy and is slurring her speech. A near patient test indicates Miss J.'s blood glucose is greater than 25 mmol/L and her concerned mother decides to take her to the local emergency department. The clerking junior doctor notices a deep, 'sighing' character to her respiratory ventilation and a characteristic 'pear-drop' like odour to her breath. Which one of the following reasons best explains the characteristic type of respiratory ventilation in this case?

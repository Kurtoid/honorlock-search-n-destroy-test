Read the selection from Oedipus Rex by Sophocles below. Then, answer the questions that follow. Oedipus: Teiresias, you know much - things teachable and things not to be spoken, things of the heavens and earth. You have no eyes, but in your mind you know what a plague holds our city. My lord, you alone can rescue us. We should learn the names of those who killed King Laius and kill them or expel them from our country. Do not withhold from us the oracles from birds, or any other way of prophecy within your skill; save yourself and the city, and save me. End this pollution that lies on us because of this dead man. We are in your hands. Teiresias: Alas, how terrible is wisdom when it turns against you! Let me go home. It will be easiest for us both to go no further in this. Oedipus: You would rob us of your gift of prophecy? Do you have no care for law nor love of your city Thebes who reared you? Teiresias: Yes, but I see that your own words lead you to error. Therefore I must fear for mine. Oedipus: For God's sake, if you know anything, do not turn from us. Teiresias: All of you here know nothing. I will not bring our troubles to the light of day. Oedipus: What do you mean? You know something and refuse to speak! Would you betray us and destroy the city? Teiresias: I will not bring this pain upon us both. Oedipus: Tell us, you villain! Teiresias: Did you not understand before? Would you provoke me into speaking?You are the murderer of the king. Oedipus: You shall not lie like this and stay unpunished.

Summarize the events that occur for AP propagation at a cholinergic nicotinic synapse.    Synaptic transmission begins when an AP arrives at the [axon]. Arrival of the AP causes the opening of [channel1]-[ion1] channels.  This allows [ion2] to diffuse into the cell.  The presence of this ion inside the cell causes [vesicle] to fuse with the membrane and release [NT] into the synaptic cleft through the process of [bulk]. The secreted NT crosses the synaptic cleft through the process of [transport]. When it reaches the post-synaptic membrane, the NT binds with receptors.  In this case, the receptor is a [receptor].  Activation of this receptor [effect].

Assume that the following equations characterize a large open economy: (1) Y = 5,000 (2) Y = C + I + G + NX (3) C = 1/2(Y - T) (4) I = 2,000 - 100r (5) NX = 500 - 500e (6) CF = -100r (7) CF = NX (8) G = 1,500 (9) T = 1,000 Where NX is net exports, CF is net capital outflow, and e is the real exchange rate.  Solve these equations for the equilibrium values for net exports (NX), savings (S), investment (I), interest rate (r), and the real exchange rate (e).

Questions 1 & 2 use the following scenario:  A 9-year-old child has suddenly collapsed. After confirming that the scene is safe, a single rescuer determines that the child is in cardiac arrest, shouts for nearby help, and activates the emergency response system by using his mobile device. He immediately begins performing high-quality CPR. Two additional rescuers immediately arrive to assist in the resuscitation attempt.   Two rescuers begin high-quality CPR while the third rescuer leaves to get the AED. What action supports 2-rescuer CPR?

Attraction Corporation produces specially machined parts. The parts are produced in batches in one continuous manufacturing process. Each part is custom produced and requires special engineering design activity (based on customer specifications). Once the design is completed, the equipment can be set up for batch production. Once the batch is completed, a sample is taken and inspected to see if the parts are within the tolerances allowed. Thus, the manufacturing process has four activities: engineering, setups, machining, and inspecting. In addition, there is a sustaining process with two activities: providing utilities (plantwide) and providing space. Costs have been assigned to each activity using direct tracing and resource drivers:       Engineering     $1,000,000       Setups     900,000       Machining     2,000,000       Inspection     800,000       Providing space     250,000       Providing utilities     180,000       Activity drivers for each activity have been identified and their practical capacities listed:       Machine hours     25,000       Setups     200       Engineering hours     5,000       Inspection hours     2,500         The costs of facility-level activities are assigned using machine hours.    What is (are) the unit-level activity(ies)?

Part 1:  Write the prime factorization for the following numbers: When you type your prime factorization, use x as the multiplication symbol.For example, instead of typing 3^4, type 3x3x3x3Don't type spaces!    Prime Factorization of 120 = [120] Prime Factorization of 140 = [140]   Part 2:  Arrange the prime factors of 120 and 140 into the following Venn Diagram.      List the all of the prime factors found in each region. Separate numbers with commas and don't type spaces. Region 1 = [1] Region 2 = [2] Region 3 = [3]   Part 3:  Based on the above Venn Diagram,   GCD(120, 140) =  [gcd]

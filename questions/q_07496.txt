CM was heavily recruited by colleges and attended one for a year, but injured his knee and was no longer able to play.  He quit school but continued to eat as if he was still working out with the team.  He had a few odd jobs until he started driving a tractor trailer truck across the states.  His boss fired him because his weight was impairing his work. CM ate a huge amount of during high school, but was active enough to maintain his 290 lbs.  His jobs, including driving the truck, were very sedentary but he continued to eat as he did in high school, and sometimes more due to boredom. He slowly gained weight throughout the years, weighing 460 lbs a little over 6 months ago.  He cannot find a job, has no friends left in the area and when he tries to be active, his weight and his knee pain limits him.  He becomes winded now if he walks more than 50 feet.

Read the case below and respond to the case questions: Honda has always prided itself for developing and controlling the technology in its vehicles.  Founder Soichiro Honda put it bluntly when he once said, "We refuse to depend on anyone else."    But times are changing in the auto market.  With the push for electric and autonomous vehicles, the pace of technology change and the cost of developing new technologies are challenging the traditional automaker's ability to manage everything in-house.   For Honda, this became a stark reality in early 2017 when Honda took its autonomous SUV out on a track for a government test-run. The sensor technology was supposed to see and adjust to any events on the track. The test-run failed miserably - a child-sized test dummy that moved in the path of the SUV was mowed down.  In the end, Honda scored a 0.2 out of 25 points on the pedestrian-oriented part of the test - the lowest performance of any manufacturer tested.  Honda realized it couldn't handle the technology development necessary for self-driving cars in-house. The firm decided to switch directions and allied with Bosch to gain access to a fully developed sensor system. Seven months later, Honda returned to the test track with an SUV that scored a 24.4 on the same test.   In contrast to Soichiro Honda's comment from five decades ago, Honda's current CEO, Takahiro Hachigo states, "We want to work with those that possess the best technology, regardless of whether they are Japanese suppliers or American ones or European ones." This significant change in perspective is evident in the range of Honda's alliances. In addition to working with Bosch on sensors, Honda is working with Baidu Inc., a large Chinese search engine company, on mapping technology and with SenseTime Co., a Chinese entrepreneurial firm, on camera software for Honda's self-driving cars. The carmaker is also working with SoftBank Corp. on artificial intelligence that will read drivers' emotions to suggest music and other environmental elements for drivers. Even though the firm has always prided itself on its engine technology, Honda is now working with Hitachi Ltd. to build motors for its electric cars.

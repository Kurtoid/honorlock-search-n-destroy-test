Lawyer prepared a proposed written agreement to settle a lawsuit. Lawyer circulated the agreement to other lawyers in her firm for editing and comment, which Lawyer maintained through a standard document "Track Changes" function. Some of the edits and comments revealed client objectives and law firm strategies in the representation. After completing a final draft, Lawyer emailed the proposed agreement to opposing counsel. Lawyer turned "track changes" to "off" in the document settings so that the edits and comments no longer were visible. Lawyer did not realize that a recipient simply could turn track changes to "on" and all the edits and comments would re-appear. Lawyer B was opposing counsel. When B received the proposed agreement, he promptly turned "track changes" to "on" because, in his experience, he sometimes could find valuable data embedded in the document. B immediately saw the edits and comments in Lawyer's document. Suspecting that Lawyer's inclusion of this electronically stored information was inadvertent and therefore valuable, B read the edits and comments.   Is B subject to discipline?

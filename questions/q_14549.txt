A string is wrapped tightly around a fixed pulley that has a moment of inertia of 0.0352 kg [?] m^2 and a radius of 12.5 cm. A mass of 423 g is attached to the free end of the string. With the string vertical and taut, the mass is gently released so it can descend under the influence of gravity. As the mass descends, the string unwinds and causes the pulley to rotate, but does not slip on the pulley. What is the speed of the mass after it has fallen through 1.25 m?

The uniform rod (length [L] m) in the figure rotates in the plane of the figure about an axis through one end, with a rotational inertia of [I] kg*m2   around this pivot point. As the rod swings through its lowest position, it collides with a [mp] kg putty wad that sticks to the end of the rod. If the rod's angular speed just before the collision is [w0] rad/s, what is the ratio of the final angular speed to the initial angular speed?

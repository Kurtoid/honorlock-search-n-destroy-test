As shown in figure below, a reversible power cycle R and an irreversible power cycle I operate between the same hot and cold thermal reservoirs. Cycle I has a thermal efficiency equal to one-sixth of the thermal efficiency of cycle R eI=16eR.  If each cycle receives the same amount of energy by heat transfer from the hot reservoir, show (analytically) which cycle (R or I) develops greater net work.

Given the following data, find the expected rate of inflation during the next year.      *         r* = real risk-free rate = 2.80%.   *         Maturity risk premium on 10-year T-bonds = 2%.  It is zero on 1-year bonds, and a linear relationship exists.   *         Default risk premium on 10-year, A-rated bonds = 1.5%.   *         Liquidity premium = 0%.   *         Going interest rate on 1-year T-bonds = 5.80%.

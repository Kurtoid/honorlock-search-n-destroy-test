USE THIS SPACE TO PRESENT YOUR PLANNING FOR SECTION A
Write a class Raptor that extends the Critter class from project 5, along with its movement and eating behavior. All unspecified aspects of Raptor use the default behavior. Write the complete header contents and cpp file function implementations with any member variables, constructors, etc. necessary to implement the behavior. In the absence of food, a Raptor moves horizontally. When a Raptor is constructed, it is passed a bool value that indicates whether it will initially walk west (false) or east (true). The Raptor should remember this value and should continue walking in that direction until it finds food. If a Raptor finds food, it should eat it, and then "stomp" up and down 10 times by moving north-south 10 times. In other words, its next twenty moves after finding food should be N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S. After finishing its ten "stomps" the Raptor should resume moving horizontally, but reverse the direction from west to east or vice versa. For example, if the Raptor had been moving west and then finds food, it will move east once it is done stomping. If two Raptor objects were constructed in the following way: Raptor* randy = new Raptor(false); Raptor* ryan = new Raptor(true);  The following would be a possible sequence of moves for randy :  W,W,W,W,W,W (eats food), N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S, E, E, E, E, (eats food), N,S,...  The following would be a possible sequence of moves for ryan :  E,E,E,E,E,E,E,E,E,E,E,E (eats food), N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S, W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W (eats food), N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S,N,S, E, E, E, ...  Remember the Critter class has the following header file: class Critter : public CritterBase { public: virtual bool eat(); virtual Attack fight(std::string opponent); virtual std::string getColor(); virtual Direction getMove(); virtual std::string getType() const = 0; virtual std::string toString(); }; The possible Attack values are ROAR, POUNCE, SCRATCH and FORFEIT. The possible Direction values are NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST and CENTER. Label your header file contents with // Raptor.h and your cpp file contents with // Raptor.cpp.

A potato chip producer and its main supplier agree that each shipment of potatoes must meet certain quality standards. If the producer determines that more than 8% of the potatoes in the shipment have "blemishes," the truck will be sent away to get another load of potatoes from the supplier. Otherwise, the entire truckload will be used to make potato chips. To make the decision, a supervisor will inspect a random sample of potatoes from the shipment. The producer will then perform a significance test using the hypothesesH0 : p = 0.08Ha : p > 0.08where p is the actual proportion of potatoes with blemishes in a given truckload Suppose that the results of the sampling DO NOT lead to rejection of the null hypothesis. Classify that conclusion as a Type I error, a Type II error, or a correct decision, if in fact the actual proportion of potatoes with blemishes in a given truckload is greater than 8%.

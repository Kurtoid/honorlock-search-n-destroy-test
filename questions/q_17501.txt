PLEASE READ:  Here, again, is the link to the Desmos scientific calculator. If an equation or image doesn't show up correctly, write down the problem as best you can and solve it. I'll view your session on Honorlock to see what you experienced, then will grade on how you solved the problem you wrote down.  I have included text descriptions of the equations to help avoid this.   When simplifying expressions, you do not have to expand any powers. For example, (7x9 + 3)2  can be left as-is. DO:  Collect and simplify like terms Multiply coefficients or variable expressions with the same base (for example, simplify x5 * x3 to x8). You can leave in negative and fractional exponents unless otherwise indicated in a problem.

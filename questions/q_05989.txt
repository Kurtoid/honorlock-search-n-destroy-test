Problem 1. [30 points] A 0.09-kg pinball travels at a constant speed of 0.20 m/s until it makes contact with the 0.40-kg flipper at the instant shown. Treat the pinball and flipper as particles and assume the flipper is rigid with all of its mass concentrated at the point of impact.   The flipper begins at rest in position 1 and is accelerated uniformly at 20 rad/s2 until it makes contact with the pinball at position 2.  The coefficient of restitution between the pinball and the flipper is e=0.9.  1. Determine the angular velocity

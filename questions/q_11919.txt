Scores on the verbal portion of the GRE follow a normal distribution with a mean of 550 and standard deviation of 120.   Suppose you repeatedly randomly sample test-takers with samples of size n = 100. Use the sampling distribution of these samples to determine the probability that the average (mean) score in a single sample will be between 490 and 610.   First, record the z-scores associated with the mean scores of 490 and 610 when n = 100. The z-score for the mean of 490 is [lowzscore] and the z-score for the mean of 515 is [highzscore]. Be sure to use at least two decimal places in the z-scores, like 0.12 and not 0.1.   Second, determine the probability that the mean score in this sample is between 485 and 515 when n = 100. The probability that the mean score in this sample is between 485 and 515 is [probability]. Enter the value for the probability to four decimal places, like 0.1234 and not 0.12     Note: I will be checking this answer by hand to verify Canvas' grading decision. Send me any work you do to be eligible for partial credit. Table II is at the end of the exam.

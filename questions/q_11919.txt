13.  Melbourne Corporation has traditionally made a subcomponent of its major product. Annual production of 30,000 subcomponents results in the following costs:                   Direct materials   $   250,000     Direct labor   $   200,000     Variable manufacturing overhead   $   190,000     Fixed manufacturing overhead   $   120,000           Melbourne has received an offer from an outside supplier who is willing to provide the 30,000 units of the subcomponent each year at a price of $28 per unit. Melbourne knows that the facilities now being used to manufacture the subcomponent could be rented to another company for $80,000 per year if the subcomponent were purchased from the outside supplier. There would be no effect of this decision on the total fixed manufacturing overhead of the company. Assume that direct labor is a variable cost. At what price per unit charged by the outside supplier would Melbourne be indifferent between making or buying the subcomponent?

Given the following road map as shown in class. Consider a search tree (the root node has depth 0) that illustrates the state-space explored by A* starting from the city Timisoara (T). Answer questions about the search tree below. The nodes are labeled using the first letter of the names of the cities on the map. Remember, nodes that have already been explored should not be explored again.   Use the Straight-line distance in the table shown above for the estimated cost h(n) between node n and the node of the final destination B for Bucharest. Use g(n) as the true cost from the origin to node n. Remember that A* uses f(n) = h(n) + g(n) to estimate the total cost from the origin to the destination. Compute the f value of the following nodes that may or may not be part of the search tree. Enter a numerical value only. Nothing else will be recognized. L, f= [f_L] M, f=[f_M] Z, f = [f_Z] D, f=[f_D] R, f=[f_R]

In each of the following short sketches, the investigators (or teachers) did something foolish. They made at least one gross error. (They also may have done some other things that were less than ideal.) Try to identify the gross error(s) or serious mistake(s).  In a short paragraph (most likely a sentence or two will suffice), indicate what was done wrong (or said incorrectly) and why it is an error and how it should have been done differently. Make sure to label each answer to match the corresponding question using number and letter (II-A, II-B, or II-C). Suggested time: 30 minutes.  Federal law requires all school districts to test students at the end of the academic year in mathematics and reading in grades 3 through 8. A school district hired Prof. Patternmaker to determine if average performance in reading was changing significantly between grades 3 and 6. Prof. Patternmaker used independent t-tests and an alpha of .05 to evaluate the data and answer the questions. A high school student was given a scale that measures anxiety. His score was very high. Before we can validly assume the student is very anxious, what do we need to know about the scale. For example, we need to know if the scale is based on a sound theory of anxiety. What else do we need to know (in a couple of sentences)? A doctoral student was doing a study that asked the following--do background knowledge, sustained attention, and language ability significantly predict the quality of text notes students record in the domain of history. The doctoral student was able to use commercially published, high quality instruments to measure language and attention but had to develop his own instrument to evaluate background knowledge. He developed the instrument and tested it with a representative sample of graduate students (N = 150). The coefficient alpha was .86. He then ran the experiment with undergrads at a local university (N = 150). Surprisingly, the coefficient alpha was .65.

You are conducting a study in order to estimate the average weight of turtles in a pond.   You would like to make sure that you obtain a large enough sample so that your margin of error (d) for a 99% Confidence Interval is no larger than 0.2 grams.  How large a sample do you need if the standard deviation in turtle weights (s) is approximately 3 grams? Round your answer to an integer.

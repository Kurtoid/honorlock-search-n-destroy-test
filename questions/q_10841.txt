(3) (23 points) A solid rod with radius 10 mm is subjected to a combined loading with two forces and a torque, as shown in the image below.   Identify which stresses are nonzero at point H and at point K on the pipe. Both points are on the outside surface of the pipe. Answer "yes"  if the stress is nonzero or "no" if the stress is zero or does not exist. Clearly label your answers on your solution sheet.   (i) Point H: (a) Bending normal stress due to the 250 N force. __________ (b) Bending normal stress due to the 700 N force. __________ (c) Torsional shear stress due to the 50 N-mm torque. __________ (d) Transverse shear stress due to the 250 N force. __________ (e) Transverse shear stress due to the 700 N force. __________   (ii) Point K: (f) Bending normal stress due to the 250 N force. __________ (g) Bending normal stress due to the 700 N force. __________ (h) Torsional shear stress due to the 50 N-mm torque. __________ (i) Transverse shear stress due to the 250 N force. __________ (j) Transverse shear stress due to the 700 N force. __________   (iii) Compute the normal stress
The ________ was one of the most divisive events in the United States during the 1960s, and one that aggravated other social and political tensions to the point where president Lyndon Johnson decided not to run for reelection in 1968.
The most critical times of exposure are at 12 hours postconception, when the two pronuclei fuse to the one-cell stage, and at 30 and 60 hours, which is when the first two divisions take place.
Male widow birds that have exceptionally long tails are less likely to survive to adulthood because they have greater difficulty in maneuvering in their environment, and are more likely to be eaten by predators. However, if they do survive, females prefer to mate with them. What is the relationship between natural selection in the strictest sense, sexual selection, and tail length in widow birds?

2.2   A scientist conducted an experiment to determine if a vasectomy (cutting of the male vas deferens) has any influence on testosterone production.  He used twelve adult male Giant African rats and divided them into three groups. All rats were tested and have the same testicular weight, sperm count, sperm motility, and testosterone levels at the start of the investigation. A vasectomy was done only on the right testes of the rats in Group 1 and Group 2. Their left testes remained untreated. Group 3 remained completely untreated. After 6 and 8 weeks the testosterone levels in the rats' blood were tested.  Seminal fluid from both testes was extracted and analysed. The results are shown in the table below.

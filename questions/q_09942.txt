On a late Sunday evening, a very motivated Anatomy and Physiology student named Oscar was up studying for an upcoming exam.  Fatigue began to set in but Oscar persisted until he actually collapsed on the floor of the study area.  As Oscar hit the floor, his head bumped the leg of the desk causing his laptop to fall and hit the back of his head.  Oscar got up very concerned about his laptop but found it to be functioning just fine.  Oscar felt a bit disoriented and just a bit 'strange' so he decided he should get some rest.

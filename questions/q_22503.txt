Consider a Hash Table implementation that utilizes linear probing over an array with a length (ie capacity) of 10. What do you expect the following code that utilizes such a Hash Table to print out? The final method named findValueAndPrintArrayIndex does exactly what it's name implies, it prints out the array index that the specified value is stored within.     public class IntegerKey { private int key; public IntegerKey(int key) { this.key = key; } public int hashCode() { return key/2; } public static void main(String[] args) { Hashtable ht = new Hashtable(); ht.put(new IntegerKey(4),"four"); ht.put(new IntegerKey(5),"five"); ht.put(new IntegerKey(6),"six"); ht.findValueAndPrintArrayIndex("six"); } }

Assume complete ionization.  Let the temperature be T = 300 degK. The material is un-doped. Find the intrinsic Fermi level EFi and carrier concentration ni = pi.        (4 points) Let the temperature be T = 300 degK. The material is doped with donors at concentration ND = 5 x 10+16 cm-3. Assuming Boltzmann statistics applies, find:   the electron concentration n,      (2 points) the hole concentration p and      (2 points) the position of the Fermi level EF.   (2 points)

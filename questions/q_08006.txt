Body color of wiggly worms is determined by the alleles B and b.        B = brown   b = tan A first generation population of wiggly worms living in the forest consists of 26 homozygous dominant (BB) brown worms, 46 heterozygous brown worms (Bb) and 28 tan worms (bb). After the population was counted for the first time, the forest was destroyed but the population of worms survived.  The sixth generation of worms consisted of 5 homozygous dominant brown worms, 32 heterozygous worms and 63 tan worms. For the next six generations the land stayed barren.  The twelfth generation of worms consisted of 4 homozygous dominant worms, 36 heterozygous worms and 62 tan worms.

A heat conducting rod, 0.90 m long, is made of an aluminum section that is 0.10 m long, and a copper section that is 0.80 m long. Both sections have cross-sectional areas of 0.00040 m2. The aluminum end is maintained at a temperature of 40degC and the copper end is at 150degC. The thermal conductivity of aluminum is 205 W/m*K and of copper is 385 W/m*K. Steady state has been reached, and no heat is lost through the well-insulated sides of the rod. The temperature of the aluminum-copper junction in the rod is closest to

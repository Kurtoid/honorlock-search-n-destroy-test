The radius of a spherical balloon is measured to be 14 inches, with a possible error of 0.05 inch. Use differentials to approximate the maximum possible error in calculating the surface area of the sphere. Round your answer to two decimal places.
Which of the following species would be expected to function as a reducing agent?
A General Social Survey asked a random sample of 1500 Americans, "Do you believe there is a life after death?"   The number from the sample who responded "yes" was 1120.  Use an appropriate formula to construct a 96% confidence interval for the proportion of all Americans who believe there is a life after death.   Show all of the appropriate work in the space below along with your confidence interval, then write a sentence to interpret your interval.  (You don't have to use any "fancy"  symbols when showing your work.  Improvise as needed.   ;-))
Verifying Max-Flow: For a flow network G=(V,E) with specified s and t and capacities c[e]>0 for edge e, we are given a flow f (you are given f[e] for every edge e).  It is claimed that f is a maximum flow.Explain an algorithm to verify/check whether or not f is a maximum flow.Be sure to state the running time of your algorithm.(Faster -- and correct -- is worth more credit.) Use the algorithms from class as black-boxes, namely DFS, BFS, Explore, Topological Sort, SCC, and Dijkstra's.  Describe your algorithm in words and state the running time (faster is worth more).   No pseudocode.. You cannot use Ford-Fulkerson or any other max-flow algorithm as a black box for this problem.  if you want to do similar to one of these max-flow algorithms then you have to restate and explain the steps of the algorithm.

In the process of capillary exchange, water and solutes move from the blood plasma to interstitial fluid (and vice versa).  It consists of two processes -- filtration and reabsorption.  In filtration, movement of fluid is from the [direction].  Within a given capillary bed, the degree to which filtration occurs is a function of net filtration pressure (NFP).  Filtration occurs whenever the value of NFP is [value].

You are studying a newly described receptor called GPR100. Your collaborators have circumstantial physiological data in mice suggesting that this receptor can activate PLCb (leading to Ca++ release from intracellular stores) and can also activate ERK-MAP. You have screened for ligands that bind to GPR100 and found a molecule that binds to the receptor and you termed it UC2020. You know nothing about how it may affect GPR100 signaling. Design experiments to determine if UC2020 functions as an agonist, antagonist, or inverse agonist and also determine if this ligand is biased in any way?

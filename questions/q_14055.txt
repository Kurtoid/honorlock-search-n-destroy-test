Calculate the minimum distribution time for a client/server network to distribute a file of size 125Mb to 10 clients. The server has an upload speed of 50 Mb/s and a download speed of 100Mb/s. Each of the 10 clients can upload at 5 Mb/s and download at 25 Mb/s. Show the calculations for each part of the formula and indicate the minimum distribution time.

In 1953, the federal government announced that it would give up its responsibility for Native American tribes. This new approach, known as the _________ policy, eliminated federal economic support, discontinued the reservation system, and distributed tribal lands among individual NativeAmericans.
In this due process system, the goal is not punishment so much as it is determining what is right.  The need for any changes in practices or policies is discussed.

Where would you find a detailed list and description of specific project assumptions associated with the project?
Suppose at the beginning of 20X6, Jamaal's basis in his S corporation stock is $0, he has a $0 debt basis associated with a $10,000 loan he made to the S corporation and a $5,000 suspended loss from the S corporation. In 20X6, Jamaal contributed $8,000 to the S corporation, and the S corporation had ordinary income of $4,000. Assume that Jamaal owns 40% of the S corporation. How much net income or loss does Jamaal report this year from the S corporation? Hint: The $5,000 suspended loss can be taken if there is enough basis at the end of the year. Remember that it is important to consider the order of the stock vs. loan basis when making considerations.

We need to enclose a field with a rectangular fence. We have 1200 ft of fencing material and a building is on one side of the field and so won't need any fencing. Determine the dimensions of the field that will enclose the largest area.  Use only concepts and techniques covered in Chapter 4. Type & Clearly label your answers below.  You will also show all work for this problem with answers on your answer sheet.  Failure to do both will result in no credit for this problem.
Problem Statement A digitally automated conveyor belt has been designed to count the number of items placed into a box. The conveyor belt has a sensor to count the number of items, and an error detection circuit displays a light if the number of items in the box is incorrect (due to manufacturing requirements).  Show the design of this error detection circuit with the following specifications:    The input to the error detection circuit is a 4-bit number, DCBA, representing the number of items in the box. The output of the error detection circuit provides a HIGH when the number of items is greater than 3, or less than 10. There will never be less than 4 items placed into the box, so the output of the error detection circuit does not matter when the sensor reaches a count of less than 4.     Requirements   Design a truth table to describe the output of the circuit. Using a K-map, write the simplified expression for the output.   In the answer box below, create your truth table.    Next, create your digital k-map in the answer box, below your truth table. On your scratch paper, make your circles and determine your output expression.  Below your digital k-map, type the output expression for the circuit. Depending on your method to solve the problem, you may end up with an output expression that does not utilize all four inputs.   Build the circuit in Multisim.  Use switches for each input D, C, B, A.  Connect the output of your circuit to an LED (probe).  Ensure that the circuit works correctly.  Submission Your submission should include: 1.)  All of the work that you used to design the circuit.  This should include your digitally created truth table, k-map/Boolean algebra, and simplified expression for the output.  2.) a Multisim file that contains your circuit.  This should NOT be a PDF, screenshot, JPEG, Word document, etc.  Submit your actual Multisim (.ms14) file once complete. When you are ready, click "Next".  You will be asked to submit your Multisim file.

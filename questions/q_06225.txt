Bacterial Counts in Food Look at the three plates that were made using the serial dilution plate technique to estimate CFU/ml from a sample of pasteurized milk on a grocery store shelf. After dilution, inoculation, and incubation, the following results were observed:  The 10-2 dilution has 986 CFU. The 10-3 dilution has 136 CFU. The 10-4 dilution has 24 CFU.  The acceptable CFU/ml of pasteurized milk is 10,000 to 20,000 CFU/ml (1x104 - 2x104 CFU/ml). Should this milk be pulled off the shelf? Justify your answer by calculating and reporting the CFU/ml of the sample used to make these dilution plates.

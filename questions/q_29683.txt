J.V., a 56-year old delivery truck driver, has been taken to the emergency department (ED) because he was experiencing chest pain. It started just after he has a quick lunch at a food truck. He told the paramedic that he often has chest pain but that it goes away when he "takes a swig of antacid," but this time the pain did not stop. On arrival he was given another dose of antacid and sublingual nitroglycerin, and the chest pain stopped. The first set of cardiac enzymes and basic metabolic profile (BMP) were drawn, and a 12-lead ECG was done. He weighs 275 points (125kg), is 5 ft, 5 inches (165cm) tall, and tells the nurse he has been overweight his whole life. He said he's had the chest pains for about 2 years but did not go to get checked because they always went away when he took antacids, and he was too busy with work to go to a doctor. He works late hours, "lives on coffee," and grabs fast food when he has time to eat. He smokes 1.5-2 packs of cigarettes a day, has a beer every evening once he is home, and usually finishes a 6-pack on the weekends. Vital signs: T 98.9', P110, R14, BP 148/98.

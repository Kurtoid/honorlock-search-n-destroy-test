Historically, the Auroch, a large wild ox, was distributed across Europe, India, and North Africa but never lived in the Arctic. About 10,000 years ago, the prehistoric settlers of India and Eurasia domesticated the Auroch, making this shaggy, one-ton grass-muncher the ultimate ancestor of every cow alive today. Unfortunately, the last live Auroch died in 1627 in the Jaktorow Forest, Poland.  Viable tissue samples from fresh or preserved Auroch meat or blood has long since disappeared.

Consider a BIBO stable transfer function, G(s), which has no zeros. Now consider another transfer function, H(s), which is the same as G(s) (including the same DC gain) except it also has a SLHP zero at -z, where z>0, i.e.,   (The above equations are two equivalent ways of writing it. I have put both in case you prefer one form over the other.) If it is desired for G(s) and H(s) to behave similarly, what should z be?

Question from textbook -- with different progeny numbers Waxy endosperm (a), shrunken endosperm (b) and yellow seedlings (d) are encoded by three recessive genes in corn that are linked on Chromosome 5.  A corn plant homozygous for all three recessive alleles is crossed with a plant homozygous for all the dominant alleles.  The resulting F1 are then crossed with a plant homozygous for the recessive alleles in a three point test cross. The progeny from the test cross are: a    b    D        292 A   B    d          280 A   B   D      2010 a   b    d       2014 A   b   D         668 a   B   d          674 a   B   D           30 A   b   d           32                     ----------                      6000   Based on the progeny data, the order of the 3 loci on chromosome 5 is most likely [order1] Based on the progeny data, the distance between the A locus and the B locus is closest to [distance1] Based on the progeny data, the distance between the B locus and the D locus is closest to [distance2]

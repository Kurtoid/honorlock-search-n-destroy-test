Nakita recorded a video of homecoming highlights of the senior class and now everybody wants a copy.  She promised to have 25 ready the next day but suddenly realized that it will take her ten hours to do that.  Her friend, Abby, volunteered to help and she can do the job alone in 15 hours.  How long will it take the girls, working together, to complete the job?

Use the data above in questions 32-34, and consult the table below. Consider whether the result of the X2 test support the llama breeder's hypothesis that coat color in llamas is the result of incomplete dominance.    35a. What is the probability that the variation between the observed and expected values is due to chance? [pvalue] 35b, Is the hypothesis supported by the data? [yesnosupported]
A quantity of an ideal monoatomic gas is heated in a cylinder with a piston applying a constant pressure of 175 kPa.  The temperature rises from 15oC to 265 oC when 12555 J of heat are applied.  The same quantity of gas starting again at 15oC is now heated in a closed container.  How much heat (in J) must be applied in this case to raise the temperature to the same 265 oC?
A circular bar AB with ends fixed against rotation has a hole extending for half of its length (see figure). The outer diameter of the bar is d2 = 3.0 in., and the diameter of the hole is d1 = 2.5 in. The total length of the bar is L = 50 in. and T0 = 97.4 kip-in. Question 1.3: At what distance x from the left-hand end of the bar should a torque T0 be applied so that the reactive torques at the supports will be equal? [enter solution in in - 3 decimal places].

To characterize cells within a tumor, scientists separated its cells using FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) into two populations: CD133low and CD133high. These two populations were further investigated by examining their proliferative abilities in culture and in vivo (see data below).  Infer THREE conclusions from the data.

A technician is given a sample of DNA from a PCR reaction, and a sample of uncut plasmid. The PCR product contains a gene of interest that the technician's supervisor wants cloned into the plasmid. The technician uses software to determine which enzymes she can use for each sample. Below is a list of restriction enzymes that cut once in the plasmid's multiple cloning site, and a list of restriction enzymes that cut on both sides of the gene of interest, but not in the gene of interest. Restriction enzymes that cut on BOTH sides of the gene of interest in the PCR product: * BamHI* EcoRI * HindIII * PstI * SacI Restriction enzymes that cut once in the plasmid's multiple cloning site: * AluI* BglI* DraI* EcoRV* HindIII Assuming all of the restriction enzyme cut sites are unique, which restriction enzyme should the technician use to digest the DNA?

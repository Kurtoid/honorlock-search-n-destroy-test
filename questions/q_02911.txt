Write VHDL for a single state within a 2-process FSM that configures the illustrated datapath to initialize the registers based on the block of code shown between the REGION BEGIN and REGION END comments (this is the same code from the previous question). Assume that select values of '1' select the left input to a mux. You only need to show the control signals within the state, not the next state logic. while (1) {    while (go == 0);  done = 0;   // REGION BEGIN  i = 1; result_r = 0; // initialize result register n_r = n; // store input n into register // REGION BEGIN    while (i > 1; // shift n_r right by 1             i++;  }   result = result_r;  done = 1;  while (go == 1);}

ALL THE REMAINING QUESTIONS ON THE EXAM REFER TO THIS OUTPUT.   Since 2016 some American athletes have protested against police brutality and racism by going down on one knee (instead of standing) during the US national anthem that is traditionally played before sporting events.  A survey asked UF students to rate their agreement with the position of athletes keeling during the national anthem, on a scale of 0-100, with 0= extremely negative opinion, 50= neither negative nor positive,  100= extremely positive opinion. The statistical analysis below looks at the ratings of agreement with kneeling during the national anthem for 5 racial groups (Asian, Black, Hispanic, Other, White), with data for 20 people in each of the groups.

The following research vignette pertains to  questions 20-25. A study seeks to understand the impact of a stigmatized label (i.e. ADHD) on children's social behavior.  For this study, the following laboratory research situation was set up:  Researchers recruited a total of 40 fifth grade students who were told to complete a task together with another peer. All of the participants were told that the focus of observation was to examine their task performance. One half of the participants were randomly assigned to Condition A which involved students being told that a "peer" (Alex) has been diagnosed with ADHD in the past year (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder--a stigmatizing condition). The other half of participants in Condition B were told that Alex has had an appendix surgery in the past year (a non-stigmatizing condition). Alex, a 5th grader who was actually part of the research team, was instructed to behave in the same way with each participant (Alex was unaware of the purpose of the research). Based on Labeling Theory, the study hypothesis was that children who think that their play partner has ADHD would be less friendly and less cooperative toward their play-partner relative to peers told that the play partner had appendix surgery. Three research assistants were trained on a coding system (codes with definitions) to assess the children's level of friendliness and cooperativeness. Then, they were asked to independently observe the behavior of child participants behind a one-way mirror and code in the following way: Friendliness: (1) friendly (2) somewhat friendly and (3) unfriendly Cooperativeness: (1) cooperative (2) somewhat cooperative and (3) uncooperative --------------------------------------------------- Which of the following is the primary purpose of this research study?

Ballinger and Pinchot Controversy
Finch beak depth was measured before and after a severe drought in 1977. The averaged results are shown in Figure 1. After the drought, there were fewer seeds available for the finches to eat and the seeds that did remain were larger and harder to crack open. Researchers claim that when large, hard seeds are the predominate food source, the average beak depth of these finches tends to increase in subsequent generations.    Figure 1. Finch beak depth before and after the 1977 drought Using the evidence provided, which of the following best justifies the researchers' claim?     A) Finch beak depth increased after the drought because the overall numbers of finches decreased, reducing competition for resources.       B) Finch beak depth increased as a consequence of selective pressure after the drought because the remaining seeds were larger and harder.       C) Finch beak depth increased after the drought due to intraspecific competition since finches with deeper beaks attract more mates.       D) Finch beak depth increased after the drought due to increased predation since finches with deeper beaks can fight off predators more effectively.

A newly intubated patient has had blood gases drawn: pH 7.32; PaCO2 66 mmHg; PaO2 68 mmHg; HCO3- 24 mEq/L. The patient is being ventilated on A/C - VC: RR 10, Vt 500, PEEP +5, FiO2 60%. You notice that peak inspiratory pressures are 48 cmH2O and plateau pressures are 40 cmH2O and the patient is not taking any spontaneous breaths. The physician asks you to increase the tidal volume to 600 mL in an attempt to blow off CO2. What do you do?

One result of the movement of ions through ion channels is the creation of an electrochemical gradient. The electrochemical gradient is
Given the following data, find the expected rate of inflation during the next year.      *         r* = real risk-free rate = 4.60%.   *         Maturity risk premium on 10-year T-bonds = 2%.  It is zero on 1-year bonds, and a linear relationship exists.   *         Default risk premium on 10-year, A-rated bonds = 1.5%.   *         Liquidity premium = 0%.   *         Going interest rate on 1-year T-bonds = 6.70%.
A selectively permeable membrane separates two solutions. Water is able to pass through this membrane; however, sucrose (a disaccharide) and glucose (a monosaccharide) cannot pass. The membrane separates a 10 M sucrose solution from a 10 M glucose solution. With time, how will the solutions change?

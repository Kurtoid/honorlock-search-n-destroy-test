Traffic Jams - Are genes on chrX limited in their transcriptional activity? Model: Since genes on chrX can only be expressed from one chromosome, as males only have one X, the ability to express a gene at very high rates on X chr is limited owing to potential transcriptional traffic jams. Below are some transcriptome data from adult humans.  RNA from many tissues and organs were sampled (heart, Liver shown). Genes were subdivided into those on the X chromosome vs. autosomes, and then further separated into low or high levels of transcription. * indicates significant differences (p < 0.01).     Answer the following questions:  Categorize the level of transcription for genes on autosomes vs chromosome X based only on the data above. Do these data support a chrX traffic-jam model?

Answer the following question based on the following scenarioDuring a kitchen inspection you observe the following. A dietary worker eating food off the line which hasn't started yet. The dietary aide states they are taste testing the food. You review the temperature logs, all the temps are acceptable, but there are none recorded for the pureed or ground foods. The staff states they took the temps but there is no place to put the results on the form. As you observe the line, you notice they are using appropriate sized scoops, but are putting heaping amounts on each plate of the macaroni and cheese. Per the written menu the regular diet should receive apple pie and the cardiac diet should receive cinnamon apple slices. You notice everyone is receiving the apple pie. As you walk through the rest of the kitchen, you notice the washed dishes being dried with a towel, and you feel one of the pans which is greasy on the outside. In the walk in refrigerator, there is no thermometer present, several lids are not securely on the containers, the zucchini is moldy, and there is an open undated bag of cheese. As you are finishing your inspection, the foodservice director informs you they have had a roach problem. She has the staff pull apart the tray line where a large outlet is located. When she kicks the outlet, several small roaches run out. She tells you, pest control has been out twice now and this is still an issue 38. Which of the following tags would most likely be issued upon inspection? a. F812 - no thermometer in fridgeb. F800 - staff eating off linec. F550 - food sitting out too long before served to patientd. F880 - nursing staff laughed at patient

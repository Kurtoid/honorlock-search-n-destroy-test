Abhishek is evaluating an expansion project. With the project, his firm should be able to expand sales by 100,000 at $55 per unit. He is concerned about the variable cost per unit, which he expects to also be $55 per unit. One potential supplier is willing to sell his firm a 6-month option on the materials that his firm would need for expansion. The supplier will accept a payment that would corresponds to a variable cost of $52 per unit. Abhi estimates, from his experience, that the standard deviation of the cost of the materials across all suppliers over the next few months will be 71 percent and the risk-free rate is 3 percent. How much should the firm be willing to pay for this option? (Use the Black-Scholes model and enter your answer rounded to the nearest dollar. You should find the value of the entire order, not on a per unit basis).

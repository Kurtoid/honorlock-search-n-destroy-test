A 23 yo man is referred to the Pulmonary Clinic for evaluation of recurrent respiratory infections. He reports symptoms of chronic purulent sputum production for at least 10 years. Physical exam reveals a barrel chest, diminished breath sounds, and scattered rhonchi. Digital exam reveals clubbing. Chest X-ray shows normal cardio-mediastinal silhouette and bilateral changes of bronchiectasis with mucous plugging. BMI = 17.7 kg/m2. Spirometry reveals obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of 44% of the predicted value. Which one of the following diagnostic tests is most appropriate for this patient?
Write down an econometric model to estimate the cross-sectional relationship between education and earnings and briefly outline the problem of ability bias and measurement bias. In what direction would you expect your estimate to be biased given ability and measurement biases?
True/False.  Enter T or F for statement.  (Do not enter the words "true" or "false".  Just the capital letter T or F) [1] Digital logic is implemented with passive, linear devices. [2] Semiconductors are useful in part due to their ability to quickly change conductivity by orders of magnitude. [3] At room temperature, Si and Ge have the same bandgap. [4] At room temperature, Si and Ge have the same intrinsic carrier concentration. [5] For Si at room temperature, the number of intrinsic carriers is relatively small compared to the total number of Si atoms. [6] For a P|N junction in equilibrium, the diffusion current balances out the drift current. [7] A p-channel MOSFET requires VGS to be negative in order to turn the transistor on. [8] A major benefit of CMOS logic is that it affords zero static power consumption. [9] Thinking about Project 4 - Diodes, the red LED showed the smallest forward-bias turn-on (threshold) voltage. [10] Thinking about Project 5 - Diode Applications, the infrared receiver circuit created a sine wave where the frequency correlated with the button pushed on the infrared remote control.

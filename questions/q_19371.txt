There are 15 Chapter Note assignments during the semester. All Chapter Note assignments are required. For each Chapter Note assignment, you are required to take 3-4 pages of handwritten notes from the textbook chapter readings and/or PowerPoint lectures.  (Contact the instructor if you have a reason to type your notes instead of hand write them). You must scan or photograph these notes and submit as a .doc, .docx, .pdf, .jpeg, or .jpg file. You may scan your notes using a free scanning app such as Adobe Scan or Cam Scanner. Or you may photograph your notes and paste the photos into a word document. (You should combine the note pages into ONE file, and not submit a separate file for each page of your notes.) You must submit your notes to the correct Dropbox by the deadline in a Microsoft .doc, .docx, .pdf, .jpeg, or .jpg format. No other formats or late assignments are accepted. You will NOT receive credit if you submit to the wrong dropbox or in the wrong file format. Emailed assignments are NOT accepted.

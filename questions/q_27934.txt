I, like an usurped town, to another due,                   5 Labor to admit You, but Oh, to no end! Reason, Your viceroy in me, me should defend,  But is captive, and proves weak or untrue. Yet dearly I love You, and would be loved fain,  But am betrothed unto Your enemy:                       10 Divorce me, untie, or break that knot again,  Take me to You, imprison me, for I,  Except You enthrall me, never shall be free,  Nor ever chaste, except You ravish me.                 14     Which lines from the poem are an example of enjambment?

A large sheet of material 50 mm thick contains dissolved hydrogen (H2) having a uniform concentration of 3 kmol/m3. The sheet is exposed to a fluid stream that causes the concentration of the dissolved hydrogen to be reduced suddenly to zero at both surfaces. This surface condition is maintained constant thereafter. If the mass diffusivity of hydrogen is 8 x 10-7 m2/s, how much time is required to bring the density of dissolved hydrogen to a value of 1.2 kg/m3 at the center of the sheet? Hints: Use the same transient equation available for temperature distribution in chapter 5  to solve for the concentration distribution.

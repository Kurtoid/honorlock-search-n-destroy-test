On Easter Egg Hunts and Economic Systems and Values and Beliefs We Live By: All the eggs are hidden in a field.  All the kids eagerly line up at the starting line. But before they start the hunt, the people running the hunt tell all the upper class kids (kids of very, very wealthy parents, about 3% of the kids) to come to a starting line very much closer to the field of eggs than the first starting line.  They then tell the kids of the upper middle class parents (doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc., about 15% of the kids) to come up to a starting line very much closer to the field of eggs than the initial starting line, but not near as close as the starting line the very rich kids are on. The rest of the kids (kids of working class and poor families; about 80% of the kids) stay way back at the initial starting line.  Then the people running the hunt say "go."  And the rich kids get to the field of eggs way before the upper middle class kids and way, way before the working class and poor kids.  And it is "easy pickin's" and they have found many of the eggs before the upper middle class kids even get there. But there's still quite a few eggs and the lower class kids haven't even gotten there yet and so the upper middle class kids find quite a few themselves. The lower class kids finally get there, but durn near all the eggs have been found, and it's really hard to find any, but they do the best they can. And after the hunt, the rich kids and upper middle class kids think they are so cool because they have found so many eggs than the working class and poor kids.  And they really believe they are so much better easter egg hunters than than the kids who didn't find many eggs at all.  To the extent they run their Easter Egg hunts the same way they run their economies, you would be more likely to find this kind of Easter Egg hunt in ________________.   All the eggs are hidden in a field.  The kids all start on the same starting line.  At the end of the hunt, we find that some of the kids have found a lot more eggs than other kids. Some of the kids found hardly any at all. And this stands to reason - some kids are faster, quicker, older, have better eye sight than others. Some, through no fault of their own, are slower, can't see well, are younger - but they still try hard. After the hunt, the people running the hunt get all the kids to gather round and they count all the kids eggs. They want to make sure that every kid goes home with a certain minimum amount of eggs. So they take some eggs away from the kids who have found the most and give to the kids who haven't found the minimum amount of eggs. The kids who had to give up eggs aren't mad or resentful. They had fun in the competition and the good feeling of having "won," but they would feel very greedy and selfish if they didn't give up some of their eggs to make sure every kid didn't have at least some. In fact, they feel really good about themselves because they did give to those who had less, and they have the respect of the kids to whom they gave eggs . To the extent they run their Easter Egg hunts the same way they run their economies, you would be more likely to find this kind of Easter Egg hunt in ________________.

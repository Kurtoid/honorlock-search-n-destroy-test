QUESTION #7 SAME FACTS AS QUESTION 4. After the surgery, Mr. Poe Tator was in a coma for several weeks but finally emerged from the coma. However, he has profound brain damage and his prognosis is dismal. Assume for this question only that the above litigation was settled within two years for a significant amount of money ($4 million). Although Mr. Poe Tator has improved slightly over this two-year period, he cannot talk nor feed himself. He has a feeding tube. He sometimes can follow objects with his eyes. He has only very slight cognitive ability. He has bed sores and, as a result, he is in constant pain that pain medication will not control. It is not probable that he will show improvement. With maximum medical care, he could live another 10 or more years. The State of Ames' Advance Directive Act is similar to Oklahoma's. Mr. Poe Tator is not terminally ill nor is he in a persistent vegetative or unconscious state. Mr. Poe Tator's family wants to withdraw the nutrition and hydration tube. The nursing home has refused to comply and the family has sought a court order. Mr. Poe Tator's wife, Tess Tator, will testify that Poe told her that he would not want to live unless he could do the things he enjoyed like hunting, drinking beer, and watching wrestling on T.V. He told her on numerous occasions, "just pull the plug." Poe Tator told his son, Couch Tator, that he never wanted to be a "vegetable." The nursing home contends the family just wants the money instead of using the money to pay for his care. You are the trial judge assigned to hear the case. ASSUME for this question only that Mr. Poe Tator executed a valid directive under Oklahoma Law. Will you order the withdrawal of the nutrition and hydration tube based on Poe Tator's directive?

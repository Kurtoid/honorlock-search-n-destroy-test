For the next 3 questions: In an attempt to model blood pressure (average of daily low-high) for a certain demographic group according to the 5 levels of work stress task level (very low, low, medium, high, very high) and LDL cholesterol levels, two models were fitted for the same 100 observations/subjects.   Five subjects were randomly assigned to each task level for a period of 1 month and daily blood pressure data were collected which were averaged to a monthly number for the subject.  LDL was measured at the beginning and end of the study and the average was presented.  The data looks like (but not provided on purpose)    Subject Blood Pressure Work Stress LDL cholesterol   1 100 very low 230    . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .    100 120 very high 320    (i) Completely Randomized Design (CRD) one-way, a.k.a. regression with one qualitative predictor, using work stress level (very low, low, medium, high, very high) as the ONLY predictor, ANOVA model with 20 observations taken under each work stress task level  yielding a SSE=253.56. (ii) Regression additive model with work stress level as a "qualitative" predictor AND LDL cholesterol as a "quantitative" predictor.  (No interaction). Yielding a SSE=153.39.

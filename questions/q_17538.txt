You work for the Daily Grind Coffee House (DGCH).  Like all other small businesses, the Daily Grind is struggling in "this tough economy".  The owner of the Daily Grind, Mr. Cap A. Chino, is a friend of your parents and knows that you are a biomedical engineering student at Georgia Tech.  He knows, therefore, that you are an awesome problem solver.  So he hires you as a consultant to examine the process by which they roast their coffee beans, with the expectation that your analysis will provide some insights into how they can improve the efficiency of their process and save money.  As a first step in your analysis, you interview Mr. Chino to find out the 'life story' of a typical coffee bean at the Daily Grind.  Part of what you learned of this process is described below.   Description of The Daily Grind's coffee roasting process The Daily Grind roasts their own coffee beans.  First, several bags of beans are delivered early in the morning to the Daily Grind.  These bags are opened and dumped into a hopper which removes debris from the beans.  The beans are then transferred by a belt to roaster.  Hot air flows into the bottom of the roaster, lifting the beans into the air and causing them to tumble about as they are heated.  The beans are exposed to temperatures ranging from 240degC to 275degC for about 30 minutes.  The process of roasting the beans causes the release of particulate matter and volatile organic compounds.   The gases leaving the roaster are sent to a cyclonic separator, which separates the particles from the gases, after which the gases are sent to a thermal oxidizer which decomposes the volatile organic compounds at high temperatures before releasing the products of this decomposition to the atmosphere.  Meanwhile, the hot coffee beans, once roasted, are transported to a cooler where they are quenched with cool forced air and a fine water mist.   Please create a visual representation (diagram, schematic, etc.) of the Daily Grind's coffee roasting process that would help you analyze the process:

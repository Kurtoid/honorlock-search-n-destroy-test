Several sources of sensory information are available to a skier as she makes her way down an alpine ski run.  Describe 3  sources/examples (make a sensory information inventory)  of exteroceptive and/or proprioceptive information that she might receive during her run.  Indicate which type of sensory information it is and indicate the sensory information that is relevant to complete the task.  This was what you did in lab #4. An example is given: Sound of the crowd - exteroceptive (audition) - not relevant to complete the task.
An engineer was performing analysis to determine the Manning's roughness coefficient (n) values for stream channels in a mixed land-use watershed. The engineer classified the stream reach sections into 3 categories: (i) smooth channel sections, (ii) stony bed with few weeds on banks, and (iii) very weedy, winding sections. The engineer encountered a labeling error while recording the information.  The following three n values were in his notebook - 0.15, 0.05, 0.025 - but without proper labeling the engineer was unable the assign the n values to proper stream reach sections.  Based on your knowledge of open-channel flow and Manning's roughness coefficient, match the three "n" values against the appropriate stream reach section categories and provide a brief supporting explanation. (i) smooth channel sections: (ii) stony bed with few weeds on the banks: (iii) very weedy, winding sections:

The following is an excerpt of an article about nutrition in humans. Please read and match the following statements with the role they would have on a future study. "In promoting reductions in dietary fat intakes, many health professionals have encouraged people to reduce their useof red meat, even though red meat is an excellent dietary source of iron and zinc, as well as being the main source ofvitamin B12 in the diet [1].  Our meat research program was originally stimulated by observations that, when urbanised, diabetic AustralianAborigines reverted temporarily to their traditional hunter-gatherer diet, there were improvements, not only in themetabolic abnormalities of diabetes [5], but also in several risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These beneficial changes occurred despite the diet containing substantial quantities of meat from wild game animals [6, 7]. The diet was low in fat (13 % energy) despite being rich in red meat, as meats from wild animals are extremely lean, of the order of 1-2 % fat [8], much of which is structural lipid and, therefore, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [9]." After these observations, researchers carried out a study comparing men under a low-fat meat diet vs. men under a vegetarian and vegan diets. To measure the impact of the diet, they measured micronutrient levels like iron and zinc and looked at cholesterol and PUFA levels.

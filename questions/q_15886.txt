You work for the zoo and have been asked to write a machine learning algorithm to distinguish between 3 species of birds which are housed together in a new jungle-like enclosure. You've tried 3 different algorithms, but each had a problem: Algorithm #1 could correctly identify species A, but confused species B and C 20% of the time. Algorithm #2 could correctly identify species B, but confused species A and C 20% of the time. Algorithm #3 could correctly identify species C, but confused species A and B 20% of the time.

While Dana was walking down the street one night, someone grabbed her purse and ran off. Dana didn't get a particularly good look at the person because of how dark it was. She thought they were of roughly medium height and build (maybe 5'7" and 140 pounds). She couldn't see any more detail than that though, including what gender the person was. When she got back to her apartment and told her roommate what happened, her roommate immediately asked, "Well, what did the man look like?" Dana said that it was dark and hard to tell. The next day Dana went to file a police report. When the officer asked Dana to describe the suspect, Dana not only described the individual as male, she also described the individual as being slightly taller and larger (5'9"; 160 pounds) that what she had actually seen the night before. The change in Dana's memory of the suspect based upon her roommate asking about the event is consistent with what memory issue?

Use the factor-label method to solve the following stoichiometry problem.   Given the following equation:  1 C3H8  +  5 O2     3 CO2  +  4 H2O How many grams of O2 are required to react with 3.2 x 1025 molecules of C3H8? To receive full credit:  You must use the factor unit method and the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the stoichiometric calculation.  Show your work (conversion factors/and units) by using the equation editor() in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use   to insert conversion factors. Be sure to include proper units and the final answer!  Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

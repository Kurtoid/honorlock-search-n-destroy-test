QUESTION 2     The solubility of a solid in water is the maximum mass of the solid that can dissolve in 100 g of water at a given temperature. An aqueous solution containing this maximum mass can be described as a saturated solution. The graph (linked to the button below) shows the solubilities of three solids at different temperatures.   Right-click the button below to open the Periodic Table in a new tab.       2.1   (i) What is the relationship between solubility and temperature for solid A?   (1)         (ii) Which solid is the most soluble at 30degC?   (1)     2.2   Explain what you would observe if a saturated solution of solid A were cooled from 90degC to 20degC   (2)

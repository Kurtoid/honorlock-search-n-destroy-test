Orphy chatted with the actor playing the CSI:Vegas DNA tech (Paula Newsome) about how DNA evidence might help.  Orphy suggested to her that mitochondrial DNA from one victim and "junk" DNA from the Y chromosome of the other victim would be the best DNA to test.  Briefly explain why:
Passage #2             There's some sweet news about chocolate: in addition to its delightful taste, it also offers physical benefits. Researchers have learned that one benefit of eating chocolate is that it is a source of desirable antioxidants. Antioxidants are molecules that reverse the deleterious effects of free radicals--harmful molecules that damage cells, leading to increased risk of heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and other age-related conditions. Until recently, only tea, coffee, red wine, and certain fruits--for example, strawberries--were thought to be sources of antioxidants, but it is now known that chocolate contains the same type of disease-fighting chemicals. Tests on human blood samples have confirmed that the antioxidants extracted from chocolate suppress cell damage and strengthen the immune system. Moreover, recent studies have revealed that dark chocolate (meaning chocolate without milk solids added, and thus with a higher percentage of cocoa) has the greatest number of antioxidants; it has been shown to reduce blood pressure and lower LDL (bad) cholesterol. If eaten daily, an ounce or two of dark chocolate containing at least 70% cocoa can help keep the heart and cardiovascular system running well.           Besides producing increased antioxidant levels and stronger immunity, chocolate also contains mood-lifting chemicals, such as the stimulants caffeine and theobromine. In addition, when mixed with sugar and fat, chocolate increases the production of the brain's "feel-good" chemicals--endorphins, which provide a feeling of pleasure; and serotonin, which acts as an antidepressant. And neuroscientists recently found that chocolate contains anandamide, a chemical that produces soothing effects on the brain. So eating chocolate not only has physical benefits; it has psychological advantages as well.           There are other scientific conclusions about the benefits of chocolate. Its stimulation of lactase enzyme activity actually helps people with lactose intolerance by blocking the cramping and bloating resulting from their inability to digest dairy products. Also, chocolate--particularly dark chocolate--is one of the few foods with a high content of chromium, which purportedly controls blood sugar. Furthermore, tests were conducted that showed animals tended to reduce alcohol intake when given a chocolate drink as an option. And finally, other tests have revealed that the antibacterial compounds in cocoa beans--the main ingredient in chocolate--may discourage, not promote, tooth decay.            Finally, recent research clears chocolate of blame associated with several problems it has long been accused of causing. For example, according to famous experiments at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the U.S. Naval Academy, chocolate does not cause acne. Another study, performed at the University of Pittsburgh, indicates that contrary to popular belief, chocolate does not trigger headaches. There is no link to hyperactivity, either, as several scientific studies found no evidence that eating chocolate generates hyperactivity, aggression, or other behavior problems.

Directions: Read the passage. Then choose the best answers for the following questions.   Why are more Americans lonely today than in the past?   It seems that Americans have become lonelier than ever before. One good reason for this is the changing American society and culture. Mobility: Americans have always moved around their country a lot. Nowadays, they move even more frequently. It is common for Americans to move in order to go to a new school, to start a better job, or simply to live in another place. As a result, many Americans live in areas where they have few friends and family, and have not yet established ties with the local community. Living Alone: In the 1950s, about 10 percent of all households only had one person. These days that figure has risen to nearly 25 percent. More Americans are living alone because they aren't married or plan to get married much later in life. Those that are already married are getting divorced more frequently, too. Independence and Privacy: Another reason for Americans' increasing loneliness comes from cultural values. Americans believe that it is good for young people to become independent as early as possible. As a result, many young men and women move out of their parents' homes when they are old enough to go to college. After this, they may only see their family from time to time. Also, Americans place great value on privacy in their daily lives. Often they do not interact with their neighbors because they prefer to be left alone, and because they believe their neighbors want the same thing. They will often choose privacy even though it means that they may feel socially isolated and lonely.     Many Americans [a1]. Mobility means [a2]. Nowadays, many Americans [a3] their local community.

Late at night, Anthony Knights, Hozell Keaton, and Knights's nephew were smoking marijuana and listening to music while sitting in or standing near an Oldsmobile sedan in Tampa, Florida. The car was parked in a grassy area between the street and the white fence of a home that belonged to one of Keaton's relatives. Knights was living at this home. The driver's side of the car was near the street and the passenger's side was near the fence. On a routine patrol around 1:00 a.m., Officers Andrew Seligman and Brian Samuel of the Tampa Police Department saw two of the car's doors open with Knights and Keaton leaning into the car. The officers believed that Knights and Keaton might be stealing something from the car. They knew the area to be "high crime" and to have gang activity from their experience responding to multiple shootings and narcotics crimes. So they drove past the Oldsmobile for a better look. Knights and Keaton then "gave the officers a blank stare," and according to Officer Seligman, "kind of seemed nervous." The officers then heard someone unsuccessfully try to start the car. Thinking that Knights and Keaton "might be actually trying to steal the vehicle," the officers decided to investigate further. Officer Seligman decided to turn around and park the patrol car near the Oldsmobile. Officer Seligman parked on the street next to the Oldsmobile in the wrong direction for traffic so that the trunk of the patrol car was nearly aligned with the trunk of the Oldsmobile. As Officer Seligman was parking, he trained his flashlight on Knights. According to Knights and Officer Seligman, the patrol car was parked in a way that would have allowed Knights to drive away. Officer Samuel left the patrol car and attempted to talk to Keaton, who was walking toward the house, but Keaton entered the house without responding. The officers then approached Knights, who sat in the driver's seat and closed the car door. Officer Seligman approached the car with his flashlight and knocked on the driver's window. When Knights opened the door, Officer Seligman "was overwhelmed with an odor of burnt marijuana." Officer Seligman asked Knights if he owned the car, and Knights said that he and his wife owned it and gave Officer Seligman his driver's license and possibly the registration for the car. The officers later confirmed that his wife owned the car. When Officer Seligman asked Knights if he had marijuana, Knights said, "I'll be honest with you. It's all gone." Officer Seligman searched Knights's person and found a pill bottle containing several different kinds of pills. Knights told Seligman that the pills were prescription allergy medication. Officer Seligman arrested Knights, placed him in handcuffs, and stood him at the rear of the vehicle. Officer Seligman then searched Knights's car, starting with a backpack that Knights said contained a prescription for the pills. He found medical documents, a firearm cartridge, and a ski mask. Inside the car he also found a scale, smoked marijuana, marijuana residue, a handgun, a rifle, and another firearm cartridge. Knights and the officers described the entire encounter as calm and amicable. After searching Knights's car, Officer Seligman approached the home that Keaton had entered. Officer Seligman knocked on the door and when Keaton answered Officer Seligman requested permission to enter the home. Keaton denied permission. Officer Seligman then radioed to the police station requesting a drug dog be dispatched to the scene. Keaton said that would not be necessary and told Officer Seligman that he could enter the home. Officer Seligman entered the home and asked Keaton which room was Knights. Keaton pointed to a bedroom. Officer Seligman entered the bedroom and conducted a search of the room. Inside he found more marijuana and additional firearm cartridges. A grand jury indicted Knights on one count of possessing a firearm and ammunition as a felon, and one count of possession of marijuana. Before trial, Knights moved to suppress his admissions and the evidence the officers found during the search. The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge who held a hearing and recommended granting the suppression motion. The trial court granted the motions to suppress. On appeal to the 11th Circuit reversed and remanded for a full trial. You are a Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. This case is now before you for review. You have been assigned to write the majority opinion addressing all issues you can identify relating to Knights. You should write your opinion addressing the underlying constitutionality of the evidence presented in Knights's trial.

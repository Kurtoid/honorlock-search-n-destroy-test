Orville and Wilbur Wright are famous for:
A disk shaped turntable, m1,  is placed horizontally so that it rotates freely about a perpendicular axis.  A remote controlled car (point mass), m2 = 5.0 kg is on the outer edge of the turntable at ri = 4.0 m.  Initially the turntable and the mass are rotating with angular velocity oi = 40 rad/s.   When the car drives without slipping inward so that it is at a final distance of rf = 1.0 m from the axis, the angular velocity of the system is of = 60 rad/s.  Find the moment of inertia of the turntable.

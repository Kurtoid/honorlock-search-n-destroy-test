THIS CONTENT IS PROTECTED AND MAY NOT BE SHARED, UPLOADED, SOLD, OR DISTRIBUTED Problem 2. Optoelectronics relies on the use of direct band-gap compound semiconductor materials that grow in the zinc-blende crystal structure. You are given one of these engineered compound semiconductors AB which has a lattice constant of [a] A. Let the two atomic species of this compound semiconductor be A and B having the following atomic weights: A = [x] g/mol and B = [y] g/mol, respectively. For your reference, Avogadro's number is NA = 6.02 x 10+23 atoms per gram molecular weight. (a) for 5 points, find the distance from the center of atom A to the center of its nearest B neighbor (b) for 5 points, find the number density of A and B atoms (#/cm3) (c) for 5 points, find the mass density (g/cm3) of the AB semiconductor

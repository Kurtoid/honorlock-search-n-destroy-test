Essay Part 2 Using the Theory of Planned Behavior and the 3 predictors as described above, analyze the situation below. Specifically, apply the three predictors to the scenario--where do you see evidence of each predictor? Then, use the theory to explain what leads to drivers' intention to use the cell phone while driving (or to not do so). The overwhelming majority of adults surveyed (90%) believe that cell phone use while driving is a dangerous or risky behavior. For example, cell phone users are >5 times more likely to get in an accident than undistracted drivers (Strayer, Drews, & Couch, 2006.).  However, 75% of drivers still take calls, send, and receive texts while behind the wheel. Nearly half of those who text while driving say they need to "stay connected to friends, family, and work," and about 25% said they are afraid they might miss something. One-third report that they know it's dangerous but do it out of habit.  Some car manufacturers, such as Ford, have installed smart phone controls that will lock the driver's phone if her/his driving seems distracted. Meanwhile, some drivers have found their own ways to curb the habit, such as by using a hands-free device, putting the phone in the back seat, or turning off sounds and notifications.

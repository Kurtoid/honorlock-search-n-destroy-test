Essay Question.  (3pts total) Type your answer using complete sentences to fully answer the question. Describe the general structure of the skin in a few sentences.  Include tissue types. Then, explain the general functions of the skin and make a connection to how the general structure contributes to the general functions.  (for example, take a tin can. the general structure is an empty cylinder of thin metal, with end caps. It's general function is to store wet food of some kind, like a soup or baked beans, while allowing it to still be accessible.  [Here's where the structure-function connection comes in] The empty structure of the can makes it ideal for a container to hold the food and the metal is what lets it keep and seal-off wet foods in storage for long periods of time! and the thinness is what makes it readily accessible to eat with a can-opener or strong stab with a knife.)

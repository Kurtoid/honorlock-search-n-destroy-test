The following are the main steps in the generation of an action potential.  Sodium channels are inactivated. Voltage-gated potassium channels open and potassium moves out of the cell, initiating repolarization. Sodium channels regain their normal properties. A graded depolarization brings an area of an excitable membrane (such as the axon hillock) to threshold. A temporary hyperpolarization occurs. Voltage-gated sodium channels are activated and open. Sodium ions enter the cell and depolarization occurs.

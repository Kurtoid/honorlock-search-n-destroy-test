Jensen Company had the following inventory data for the year:    Jan. 1 Beginning inventory 1,000 units @ $2 = $2,000   Mar. 15 Purchase 5,000 units @ $2.50 = $12,500   June 30 Purchase 4,000 units @ $3 = $12,000   Oct. 1 Purchase 6,000 units @ $3.50 = $21,000    On December 31, there are 2,000 units of the item in the physical inventory. Calculate cost of goods sold for the year assuming Jensen uses weighted average cost. (Round average cost per unit to four decimal places. Round cost of goods sold to the nearest dollar.)

Use molecular orbital theory to determine which of the following difluorine species, F2, F2-, F2+, is expected to have the shortest bond length then state whether the species with the shortest bond length is paramagnetic or diamagnetic. Use the following valence MO order: s2s < s*2s < s2px < p2py = p2pz < p*2py = p*2pz < s*2px   Shortest Bond Length: [shortest] Paramegnetic or Diamagnetic: [ParaOrDi]

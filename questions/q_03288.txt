Prior to the first hearing, the lawyer for the Department contacted the Client's brother to set up an interview. The lawyer for the Department told the brother that he wanted to talk to him about his sister, and that the interview would last for about an hour. The brother, who has no children, has never had contact with the Department, and did not know what he was supposed to do. He told the lawyer for the Department that he would get back to him. The brother then called his sister's lawyer.

The keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+Tab" should rotate the active tab to the right, and "Ctrl+Shift+Tab" should rotate the active tab to the left. If these keyboard shortcuts do not work for you, contact some relevant course staff member(s). When accessing documentation via an internal link, select the down arrow () and then select "Preview".

A variable force of magnitude F(x) moves a body of mass m along the x-axis from x1 to x2. The net work done by the force in moving the body from x1 to x2 is  where v1 and v2 are the body's velocities at  x1 and x2. Knowing that the work done by the force equals the change in the body's kinetic energy, solve the problem.How many foot-pounds of work does it take to throw a baseball 40 mph?

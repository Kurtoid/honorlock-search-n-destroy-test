In class we covered a reaction called the "pinacol rearrangement" which dehydrates 1,2-diols to yield aldehydes/ketones via carbocation intermediates. An example of a pinacol rearrangement is shown below.  The following deamination (elimination of NH3) of a b-aminoalcohol proceeds through a mechanism similar to that of a pinacol rearrangement. Note the curved arrow indicating that nitrogen gas (:N[?]N:, N2) will depart as a leaving group in the next mechanistic step.  Which of the following species (A-D) is a mechanistic intermediate in this deamination reaction? [intermediate]  Which of the following molecules (E-H) would be the expected major product of this deamination reaction? [product]  Two (2) of the following b-aminoalcohols (I-L) could give the same product as the pinacol rearrangement shown at the very top of this page (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) in the deamination reaction. Answer the following questions about these b-aminoalcohols. Note that ring contraction rearrangements may occur to reduce ring strain. Could b-aminoalcohol I give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon treatment with NaNO2 / HCl? [betaI] Could b-aminoalcohol L give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon treatment with NaNO2 / HCl? [betaL]

Use a normal probability plot to asses whether the sample data could have come from a population that is normally distributed.An industrial psychologist conducted an experiment in which 40 employees that were identified as "chronically tardy" by their managers were divided into two groups of size 20. Group 1 participated in the new "It's Great to be Awake!" program, while Group 2 had their pay pay docked. The following data represent the number of minutes that employees in Group 1 were late for work after participating in the program.

A 65 year old man is treated for diverticulitis with intervenous amoxicillin/sulbactam so back down for five days. On day five he developed fever, altered mental status, and a chest radiograph revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate. He was intubated and sputum cultures grew a resistant Pseudomonas. His antibiotics were changed to ticarcillin/clavulanate and tobramycin. Two days after the antibiotic change the patient's fever decreased and he was more alert. On day four after change of antibiotics the patient developed a fever of 102degF, his white blood cell count increased from 12,000 to 19,000, and he had several episodes of watery diarrhea. A stool sample was positive for fecal leukocytes and the presence of yeast. Additional medication included intervenous famotidine,  prophylactic low molecular weight heparin, and enteral feeding with an iso-osmotic nutritional product. Which of the following is the appropriate intervention?
Types of energy include:
Which of the following conditions will ALWAYS result in a spontaneous reaction?
A nurse is assessing the vital signs of a patient diagnosed with a fluid volume deficit.  Which vital sign results would suggest this condition?

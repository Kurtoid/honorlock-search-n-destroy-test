A shuffle of two strings X and Y is formed by interspersing the characters into a new string, keeping the characters of X and Y in the same order.For example,  Z=sseveral is a shuffle of X=sseal and Y=evr by doing X[1],X[2],Y[1],Y[2],X[3],Y[3],X[4],X[5]. Given three strings X=X[1]X[2]...X[n], Y=Y[1]...Y[m] and Z=Z[1]...Z[m+n], check whether Z is a shuffle of X and Y.

Name one National Patient Safety Goal:
A 42-year-old man follows up with you in clinic. For years you have tried to convince him to quit smoking. His friend, whom is only 49 years old, was recently diagnosed with lung cancer. His friend is a smoker as well. Your patient is worried he could have lung cancer and wants to undergo lung cancer screening. He is asymptomatic but worries that he will now get lung cancer given what has happened to his friend. Regarding this smoking history, he has smoked one pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years - a 20 pack year smoking history. He states "doc, you have to screen me now! I saw on Google you can do this with a cat scan!" You advise your patient:
You have a 10 gram ice cube at a temperature of -20 degrees Celsius.  Fill in the blanks to show your work as you calculate the amount of thermal energy that must be exchanged to vaporize this ice cube.   Even though they are different in reality, please assume that the Specific Heat Capacity of water is the same for all of its phases. e., assume HCsolid = HCliquid = HCvapor = 1 cal/g/0C. Latent Heat of Vaporization = 540 cal/g Latent Heat of Fusion = 80 cal/g Pay attention to the units and understand if you're being asked for "calories," or "calories per gram," or "degrees," etc. Enter numeric values only. g., if the answer is seven, you would enter "7" not "seven." Do not enter any commas or decimal points. If the answer is one thousand, enter "1000" not "1,000" or "1000.0" etc. Do not enter any negative numbers. You are being asked to calculate the "total amount of energy that must be exchanged" so there is no need to use negative numbers.  DT for this transformation = [value1] 0C. Sensible Heat Required per gram for this transformation = [value2] cal/g. Total Sensible Heat Required for this transformation = [value3] cal. The phase change the water goes through requires [value4] cal/g. Total Latent Heat required for this transformation = [value5] cal. Total amount of Thermal Energy required to make this transformation = [value6] cal.

Directions: Read the passage. Then read the statements and answer true or false.   Jury Selection       In the United States, juries are selected from a larger group of people who are called for jury duty. The names of possible jurors are often made up from lists of people who have registered to vote in a particular area. All jurors must meet certain requirements, although the exact qualifications vary from state to state. In general, jurors must live locally, be old enough to vote, have U.S. citizenship, and not have a criminal record.       Possible jurors are questioned in a courtroom by the judge and the lawyers on both sides. The lawyers want to know if the jurors can understand their arguments. They also want to find out if there is anything in a person's background that might cause them to prejudge a defendant, either positively or negatively. For example, a juror may be related to the defendant or have the same occupation. This may be a reason for the person to decide in favor of the defendant even before he or she hears the evidence in court. In such cases, the person is usually not selected as a juror. The lawyers question the available jurors until a group of 12 has been selected.      When people are on jury duty, they must be available for a specific period of time, often one or two weeks. After that period is over and they have not been selected, they can go back to their normal lives. However, people who are selected as jurors must go to court every day during the trial until it is over. Most trials last only a few days, but sometimes they can last weeks or even months.   1.

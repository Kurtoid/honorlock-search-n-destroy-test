EXTRA CREDIT QUESTION A concentric tube heat exchanger for cooling lubricating oil at 160 oC mass flow rate of 0.25kg/s, consist of a thin-walled inner tube of 30mm diameter carrying water mass flow rate 0.1Kg/s with inlet temperature of 20 oC and outer tube of 50mm diameter carrying oil. The exchanger is of length 10m and operates in counter flow.  The thermal capacity rate of the oil is [answer1] W/K and for the water it is [answer2] W/K If the outlet temperature of the oil is 140 oC determine the total rate of heat transfer [answer3] W. If the mean outlet temperature of the water is 45oC determine the log mean temperature difference [answer4] Determine the overall heat transfer coefficient for the heat exchanger [answer5] W/m2 K. If the heat exchanger was operated in parallel flow configuration, the new log mean temperature difference is [answer6] and the new length required is longer, true or false [answer7] ?.

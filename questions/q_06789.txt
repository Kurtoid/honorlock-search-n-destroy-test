Mutualisms  Leaf-cutter ant colonies, which farm fungi for food, are often infested with a specialized parasitic fungus called Escovopsis. Under normal conditions, the ants periodically "weed" their fungal gardens, removing unwanted materials and organisms. Figure 6, illustrates results of an experiment showing what happens to weeding behavior when the ant colony is exposed to water, to Trichoderma (a generalist fungal parasite), and to Escovopsis.  B. Summarize the main results of Figure 6. (2pts)

Based on all of the information provided in this question, complete the following "C" function, dma_init, by selecting the appropriate choice in each of the given dropdown boxes. The response chosen for some dropdown box is meant to replace the "" statement that immediately precedes this box. (NOTE: If you can't see an entire possible answer, zoom out. You can zoom out with Ctrl-minus, i.e., press the Ctrl key and the "-" key at the same time. Ctrl-plus can be used to zoom in.) ----------------------------------------------------- In this problem, the DMA system will be used to reverse the order of characters within a string (aka an array of characters). This task can be easily done using software, but requires the CPU to be held up completing this task. Using DMA for this task instead would allow the CPU to work on other tasks while DMA is reversing the string.  Assume the following parameters:   The string to be reversed is 100 characters long and is stored in data memory at addresses 0x2000 - 0x2063.  The reversed copy of the string should be stored at addresses 0x3000 - 0x3063.  The data should be copied using a block transfer, using the largest burst length possible for the given string size.  Software will manually trigger a transfer whenever it needs to reverse the string.

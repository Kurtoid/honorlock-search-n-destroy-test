Consider three advanced processors:   processor X has a CPI of 0.5 and a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz processor Y has a CPI of 0.25 and a clock frequency of 2.8 GHz processor Z has a CPI of 0.25 and a clock frequency of 4 GHz.   (a) Which of these three processors is most likely to have the smallest depth pipeline? Why? (b) Assume that processor Y has a pipeline depth of 10 stages and an issue width of 4. If there are no branch mispredictions and no data dependences, what is the expected performance improvement over a 1-issue processor with the classical 5-stage pipeline? Assume that the clock cycle time decreases in proportion to the number of pipeline stages.

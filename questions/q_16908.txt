When the body is deprived of food, the set point of the metabolic rate can become reset to a lower-than-normal value. This means your body digests food slower and gets more energy from the food. This lowering of the metabolic rate is the body's attempt to stave off starvation and keep the body functioning properly at a slower rate. Many people who periodically deprive themselves of food in attempts to lose weight find that after the initial weight loss it becomes increasingly difficult to lose more pounds. This difficulty stems from the lowering of the metabolic set point. Exercise may counteract some of these effects by the increasing metabolic demands.

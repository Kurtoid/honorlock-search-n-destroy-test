Excel Task 9      (max 8 pts) Continue updating the "Order Ticket" sheet of the exam file.     We have a new promotion that gives an extra discount on appetizers  Each store manager can decide what discount to charge.  Setup the sheet so that the manager can just type a new discount percent into cell F1 and everything else works automatically.   Task 9:  Setup column F to compute the dollar amount of the appetizer discount (if any).  Type the heading "Discount %" into cell E1. Type the number 15% into cell F1.  That's the current discount percent. Type the heading "Appetizer Discount" into cell F3. Create formulas in F4:F15 that display the correct dollar value of the discount for that row  If the row is an appetizer, then display the discount amount in dollars.    Example: right now, row 4 has 2 orders of Garlic Bread, which costs a total of $10.  They're appetizers, so your logic function in F4 should display 1.50 as the discount.   If the row is not an appetizer then display a numeric zero ... not a character result. You must use Excel logic functions so that your formulas will work for other groups of customers -- don't just assume that appetizers are always on the same rows.  You must be able to provide the right discount, no matter which rows have appetizers. You must use a cell reference for the discount amount. If you just type 15% into your formulas, you will lose points. You must use a mix of relative and absolute cell references in your formulas.      Format the results with 2 decimal places. Don't worry about the borders on the cells.  We are only grading your formulas and numeric formatting.     NOTES:  This task will be graded manually, based on our evaluation of the XLSX file you submit.

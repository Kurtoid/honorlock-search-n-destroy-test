To prove they provide adequate protection against head injuries, bicycle helmets must be able to withstand government impact tests without cracking more than 8% of the time. A new helmet design has just been introduced. The new helmet is thought to be more stylish than older helmets, but consumer groups are worried that it will crack more than 8% of the time.     300 of the new helmets are randomly sampled and tested.

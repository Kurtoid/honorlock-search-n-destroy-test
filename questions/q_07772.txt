Read the following information carefully and use it to answer the questions that follow. You are helping a research team that wants to compare different treatments for generalized anxiety disorder. The team is comparing two types of therapies. Drug therapies use medication to reduce anxiety. Mindfulness-based therapies help patients develop mental skills that reduce anxiety. Patients in the study receive one of these types of treatment for three months. The research team measured anxiety using Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Higher scores on the HAM-A indicate more anxiety. The team knows from other research that the mean level of anxiety for the population is 26.7 on the HAM-A. Patients in this study were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. One group received the drug escitalopram. Another group received the drug paroxetine. A third group was trained in Mindfulness-based Habit Change (MBHC), a therapy that helps people identify thinking habits related to anxiety. A fourth group was trained in how to meditate in order to change their relationship to anxious thoughts. The study results are contained in the file anxiety_therapy_comparison.jasp. It contains the following variables: TreatmentType. Whether the patient received a drug therapy or a mindfulness-based therapy. Therapy. Whether the patient received escitalopram, paroxetine, MBHC training, or meditation training. PreStudyAnxiety. Patients' HAM-A scores at the beginning of the study, before any treatment. PostStudyAnxiety. Patients' HAM-A scores immediately after the study, after three months of treatment. FollowUpAnxiety. Patients' HAM-A scores one year after the study concluded.

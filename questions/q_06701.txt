In 1996 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Olestra (a man-made fat manufactured from sugar and vegetable oil) as a food additive.  Potato chips were the first Olestra-containing food product on the market in the United States.  A lot of controversy soon followed.  Some people complained of intestinal problems after eating the chips and concluded that the Olestra was at fault.  Two years later, researchers at John Hopkins University designed an experiment to test whether this food additive causes cramps.  The researchers used a Chicago theater as a "laboratory." They asked 1,100 people between the ages of thirteen and thirty-eight to watch a movie and eat their fill of potato chips.  Each person got an unmarked bag that contained 13 ounces of chips.  Of the 1,100 individuals, 563 got Olestra-containing chips, and 529 got regular chips. Afterward, the researchers contacted all of the people and recorded any reports of gastrointestinal problems.  Of the 563 people who got the Olestra-containing chips, 89 (15.8%) complained about cramps.  Of the 529 people who got regular chips, 93 (17.6%) complained about cramps.  The experiment showed there was very little difference between people who ate Olestra and those who ate regular chips. Match the part of the scientific method below with the section of the experiment on the right.

1. (20 points) Multiple-choice questions:     (1) Two types of errors associated with hypothesis testing are Type I and Type II. Type II error is committed when (3 points)          (A) We reject the null hypothesis whilst the alternative hypothesis is true         (B) We reject a null hypothesis when it is true         (C) We accept a null hypothesis when it is not true     (2) A hypothesis test is done in which the alternative hypothesis is that more than 10% of a population is left-handed. The p-value for the test is calculated to be 0.25 and the significance level is 0.01. Which statement is correct? (3 points)         (A) We can conclude that more than 10% of the population is left-handed.         (B) We can conclude that more than 25% of the population is left-handed.         (C) We can conclude that exactly 25% of the population is left-handed.         (D) We cannot conclude that more than 10% of the population is left-handed.     (3) Suppose we wish to test H0: m <= 53 vs H1: m > 53, what will result if we conclude that the mean is greater than 53 when its true value is really 55? (3 points)         (A) We have made a Type I error         (B) We have made a correct decision         (C) We have made a Type II error         (D) None of above are correct     (4) Given H0: m=25, H1: m[?]25, and p-value = 0.041. Do you reject or fail to reject H0 at the 0.01 level of significance? (3 points)         (A) fail to reject H0         (B) not sufficient information to decide         (C) reject H0     (5) Which of the following statements about hypothesis testing is true? (4 points)         (A) If the p-value is greater than the significance level, we fail to reject H0         (B) A type II error is rejecting the null when it is actually true         (C) If the alternative hypothesis is that the population mean is greater than a specified value, then the test is a two-tailed test         (D) The significance level equals one minus the probability of a Type I error         (E) None of the above statements are true     (6) Suppose H0: p=0.4, and the power of the test for the alternative hypothesis p=0.35 is 0.75. Which of the following is a valid conclusion? (4 points)         (A) The probability of committing a Type I error is 0.05         (B) The probability of committing a Type II error is 0.65         (C) If the alternative p=0.35 is true, the probability of failing to reject H0 is 0.25         (D) If the null hypothesis is true, the probability of rejecting it is 0.25         (E) If the null hypothesis is false, the probability of failing to reject it is 0.65   2. (30 points) For determining the half-lives of radioactive isotopes, it is important to know what the background radiation is for a given detector over a certain period. A g -ray detection experiment over 60 one-second intervals yielded the following data: 0 2 4 6 6 1 7 4 6 1 1 2 3 6 4 2 7 4 4 2 2 5 4 4 4 1 2 4 3 2 2 5 0 3 1 1 0 0 5 2 7 1 3 3 3 2 3 1 4 1 3 5 3 5 1 3 3 0 3 2 Do these look like observations of a Poisson random variable with mean l = 3? To answer this question, do the following: (a) Find the frequencies of 0, 1, 2, . . . , 8. (5pts) (b) Calculate the sample mean. How is the value different from to the mean l? (5pts) (c) Write down the hypothesis test. Use a = 0.05 and a chi-square goodness-of-fit test to answer this question. (20 pts) Here we set our sets of outcome as A1={0, 1}, A2 = {2}, A3 ={3}, A4 = {4}, A5={5, 6}, A6 = {7, 8,....}. For poison distribution, we have P(X=0) = 0.049, P(X=1) = 0.149, P(X=2) = 0.224, P(X=3) = 0.224, P(X=4) = 0.168, P(X=5) = 0.101, P(X=6) = 0.050, P(X=7) = 0.022, P(X=8) = 0.008 3. (25 points) Let X and Y denote the heights of blue spruce trees, measured in centimeters, growing in two large fields. We shall compare these heights by measuring 12 trees selected at random from each of the fields. Take a = 0.05, and use the statistic W--the Wilcoxon sum of the ranks of the observations of Y in the combined sample--to test the hypothesis H0: mX = mY against the alternative hypothesis H1: mX < mY on the basis of the following n1 = 12 observations of X and n2 = 12 observations of Y. x: 90.4 77.2 75.9 83.2 84.0 90.2 87.6 67.4 77.6 69.3 83.3 72.7 y: 92.7 78.9 82.5 88.6 95.0 94.4 73.1 88.3 90.4 86.5 84.7 87.5 4. (25 points) Let pm and pf be the respective proportions of male and female white-crowned sparrows that return to their hatching site. We observed that 124 out of 894 males and 70 out of 700 females returned. Does your result agree with the conclusion of a test of H0: pm = pf against H1: pm [?] pf with a = 0.05?  5. (Bonus 10 points) Let X1, X2, ... , Xn be a random sample of size n from the normal distribution N(m,100), which we can suppose is a possible distribution of scores of students in a statistical course that uses a new method of teaching (e.g., computer-related materials). We wish to decide between H0: m = 60 (the no-change hypothesis because, let us say, this was the mean score by the previous method of teaching) and the researcher's hypothesis H1: m > 60. Let us consider a sample size n=25. Of course, the sample mean x is the maximum likelihood estimator of m; thus it seems reasonable to base our decision on this statistic. Initially, we use the rule to reject H0 if and only if x >= 62. (a) Find the values of K(61) and K(65). (b) What is the Type II error for K(65)?

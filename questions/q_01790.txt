(25 points, 25 mins) A cylindrical water heating element consists of an inner rod (k = 5 W/m*K, r = 8 mm) that produces heat, surrounded by a protective sheath of outer radius 11 mm and k = 15 W/m*K. There is no gap between the rod and the sheath. The outer surface temperature of the sheath is 175degC, and the water being heated is at 30degC, with h = 1500 W/m2K.  Calculate: A. The temperature at the inner surface of the sheath (same as the outer temperature of the rod.) B. The temperature at the center of the heat generating rod.

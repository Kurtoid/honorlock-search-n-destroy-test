In the figure, two blocks, of masses 2.00 kg and 3.00 kg, are connected by a light string that passes over a frictionless pulley of moment of inertia 0.00400 kg * m2 and radius 5.00 cm. The coefficient of friction for the tabletop is 0.300. The blocks are released from rest. Using energy methods, find the speed of the upper block just as it has moved 0.600 m.

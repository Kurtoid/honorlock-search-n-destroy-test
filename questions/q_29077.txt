Imagine that you conducted a hypothesis test examining how automobile ownership (i.e., someone owns an automobile or does not own an automobile) affects happiness (measured by a survey). You found that people who do not own automobiles tend to be significantly happier than those that do own an automobile. You then computed the effect size, d = 0.75. a) Why is it important to compute an effect size? b) Please interpret the Cohen's d value (d = 0.75) by explaining what it means in terms of automobile ownership and happiness.

Embryonic cell cycles allow the rapid division of cells in the early embryo.  These mitotic cell cycles are much shorter in length than the mitotic cell cycles of cells in a mature organism.  In the embryonic cell cycles, mitosis takes approximately the same amount of time as it does in the cell cycles of mature cells.  What do you think is a result of the embryonic cycle?

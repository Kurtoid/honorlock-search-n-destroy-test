He also performs a posterior spinal fusion of L2-L3 with an interbody fusion device by posterior approach into anterior column.  The procedures also includes L2-L3 interspinous process wiring.  Bone is harvested from the right posterior iliac crest for bone grafting.  The primary closure includes an L1-L2 laminotomy.  The patient tolerates the surgical procedure and is taken to the surgical ICU.  Fifteen days later, the patient is transferred to an acute rehabilitation facility for ongoing therapy and recovery.

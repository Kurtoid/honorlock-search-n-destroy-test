In a certain PWR plant, there are two check valves in series to isolate the RCS from the low pressure coolant injection (LPCI) system which is outside of the containment building. Failure of these 2 valves would result in RCS system pressure ([?] 2200 psia) being applied to the LPCI piping which is rated at about 600 psia. In such an event, the LPCI is expected to fail; the core is expected to melt; and radioactivity will be released into the auxiliary building (outside containment). If the probability of a valve failure is 10-3, determine the probability of the LPCI failing for two configurations: (1) two check valves in series, and (2) an alternative design with three valves in series.

This is an extra-credit question.    A crane in a marble quarry is mounted on the rock walls of the quarry and is supporting a 2000 kg slab of marble. The center of mass of the 1000 kg boom is located at distance x=2.50 m from the pivot end of its 15-m length, and the cable supporting the boom is attached at 10.0 m from the pivot end.  What is the magnitude of the vertical component of the force exerted by the ledge on the pivot end of the boom? Show work by typing in!

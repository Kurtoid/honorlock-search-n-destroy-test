9) Assume the below G-CPU instructions have already been run, and the instruction that follows in part a, b, ..., or h will follow, i.e., each part (a-h) is independent from the preceding part.    The address for each of the instructions in parts a-h is $C008. Assume also that the 64k x 8 of memory is composed entirely of SRAM.  Hand-assemble the following G-CPU instructions and fill in the blanks using HEX.  EA is the 16-bit effective address.  All of your answers in this problem should be in hex. If there is no effective address, write "none". If a box is not needed, also write "none".

Modern cetaceans, the taxonomic group that includes whales, dolphins, and porpoises, evolved from land mammals. However, it has only been within the past few decades that transitional fossils have been found that have shed light on cetacean hindlimb reduction. DNA data suggest that cetaceans are most closely related to Hippos, which are even-toed ungulates. Other even-toed ungulates include deer, pigs, camels, and cows. Which statement describes most accurately how the early cetacean,Pakicetus, fossil ankle bones shown in the figure  supports the hypothesis that cetaceans are closely related to even-toed ungulates?A)This demonstrates that the early cetaceans had ankles 50 million years ago.B)The Pakicetus ankle bone is most similar to other mammal ankles, suggesting a relationship between other mammals and cetaceans.C)The two humps on the bottom end of the Pakicetus ankle bone is a distinguishing feature shared with other even-toed ungulates.D)The Pakicetus ankle bone suggests that Pakicetus most likely evolved from pigs.

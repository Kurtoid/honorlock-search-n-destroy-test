Suppose you record the price of a house (measured in dollars) and its living space (measured in square feet) for 100 randomly selected houses in Auburn. Your sample contains houses with living spaces ranging from 750 to 3500 square feet. A scatterplot indicates a linear relationship between the two variables. Suppose that the coefficient of determination is 0.78 and the prediction equation is as follows: price = 45000 + 110 space. (a) What would it mean for price and space  if these variables had a negative association? (b) Interpret the coefficient of determination in context. (c) Predict the price of a house in Auburn that has 5000 square feet living space. Comment on the appropriateness to use the prediction equation for this case. (d) What would be the value of the correlation coefficient? Is it an appropriate measure of the strength of the relationship between price and space? (e) Interpret the slope of the prediction equation in context.

Essay A: This essay must be written in full sentences at the College level. If you have covered all parts, you will likely have 8-10 sentences or 2 significant paragraphs. Make sure you are detailed and define all relevant terms and explain their role in the process. An action potential is a signal that causes a cell to increase its intracellular calcium. In this essay, explain where this intracellular calcium comes from in a skeletal muscle fiber and then follow the domino effect of this influx through the power stroke. -- Explain where calcium comes and the activation of any channels that control it. from and what it does within the cell. --Explain the process that uses calcium and ATP for the sliding filament theory. Be detailed about the activity of the thick and thin filaments and the process of phosphorylation.   (Note: You should assume that the action potential has already arrived at the cell and the peak voltage is currently traveling down the membrane...this essay is only about the effects of calcium in the cell. Do not discuss the voltage change and channel functioning that controls an action potential down the cell.)

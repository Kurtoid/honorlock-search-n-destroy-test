Elizabeth turned 30 years old today.  Currently, she has $15,000 saved towards her retirement.  She plans on working until age 65 (t = 35) after which she plans on retiring.  Her plan is to contribute a fixed amount to her retirement account at the end of each of the next 35 years.  Her first contribution will occur in one year (t = 1), while the final contribution will occur on her 65th birthday (t = 35).  Once she retires, she plans on withdrawing $150,000 annually from her retirement account.  (She realizes that the purchasing power of $150,000 will decline each year with inflation.)  The first retirement withdrawal will occur at age 66 (t = 36), while her 25th and final withdrawal will occur on her 90th birthday (t = 60).  After age 90, she expects to have nothing in her retirement account.  The retirement account is expected to generate an annual return of 8%.  How much will she need to contribute to her retirement account at the end of each of the next 35 years if she wants to accomplish her goals?

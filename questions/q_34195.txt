A new graduate student is hired to take the temperature profile of a nearby frozen lake.  To do this, he drills a hole in the ice and lowers a thermometer through the water from the surface to the bottom of the lake and records the temperature at every 10-ft interval.  Unfortunately, he didn't write down the depth that was associated with the temperature reading.  The temperatures that were recorded are:2.8C3.2C3.9C1.8C0.9CBecause of the density properties of water, we can easily determine the depth at which these temperatures were recorded.  Arrange the temperatures in order from the surface to the bottom.  For example, place the number 1 next to the temperature that's at the surface of the lake, the number 2 next to the temperature below #1, and so on.  Number 5 will be the temperature at the bottom of the lake.
Consider the transport of K+ from the blood (where its concentration is about 4 mM) into an erythrocyte that contains 150 mM K+. The transmembrane potential is about -60 mV, inside negative relative to outside. What is the free-energy change for this transport process? (These values may be of use to you: R = 8.315 J/mol . K; T = 298 K;  Faraday constant = 96,480 J/V)

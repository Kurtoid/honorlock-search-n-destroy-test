25. Appraisers usually use Epley's model to estimate the economic life of the subject structure based on information on comparable properties. For a comparable property, the recent sale price of the whole property after adjustments less site value as well as the value of the depreciated site improvements (ASP) is estimated to be $250,000. The reproduction cost new (RCN) of the major structure is $320,000. The actual age of this comparable property (major structure) is 12 years. What is the estimated economic life of similar properties?
Case Study #1: Mr. J. is a 48 year old, 5'10", medium frame male who currently weighs 170 lbs (77.3 kg). He has cirrhosis. His UBW for many years prior to being diagnosed with cirrhosis was 160 lbs (~73 kg). He has been admitted to the hospital on previous occasions for treatment of cirrhosis. The underlying cause of his cirrhosis has been attributed to chronic alcoholism. On medical rounds two days after admission to the hospital it was noted that Mr. J had severe ascites. The medical team also noted that Mr. J appeared to be confused (i.e., he did not know where he was, his name or the year), and he had impaired neuromuscular control with asterixis. The nurse reported that he was difficult to arouse when she attempted to take his vital signs. His lab values include a serum albumin of 2.7 g/dl and serum bilirubin (total) of 2.8 mg/dl (normal range: 0.2-1.3 mg/dl). After examination of the patient, the medical team determined that Mr. J. has hepatic encephalopathy. The physician ordered lactulose. A sodium restricted diet was ordered. Mr. J's serum calcium is 7.7 mg/dl, and his serum albumin is 3.2 g/dl. The normal serum calcium range is 8.5 to 10.8 mg/dl. Which of the following statements is most correct?

DIRECTIONS: Choose the best answer for each question.The Changing Face of Kung Fu[A] In the fifth century - according to legend - an Indian master taught some monks at the Shaolin Temple a series of exercises, or forms, inspired by the movements of animals. These forms became the basis for the style of fighting known as kung fu. Over 16 centuries, the monks have used kung fu for self-defense and in war. With it, they have won many battles against their enemies.[B] In Dengfeng today, ten kilometers from the Shaolin Temple, there are over 60 martial arts schools with more than 50,000 students. They come to the schools for a variety of reasons. Some hope to become movie stars. Others come to learn skills that will ensure good jobs in the military or police force. A few are sent by their parents to learn self-control and hard work.[C] Master Hu Zhengsheng teaches at a small school in Dengfeng. Recently, he was offered an important role in a kung fu movie. It would have been good publicity for his school, but he did not accept. He doesn't agree with how kung fu is often shown in movies. He feels they show too much violence.[D] Unlike many large schools, which teach acrobatics and kickboxing, Hu teaches his students traditional kung fu forms. He teaches them the way his master - a Shaolin legend - taught him. But attracting new students to this style of kung fu has become a problem. Hu is afraid his art will soon die out. He has to remind his students that kung fu was designed for fighting, not to entertain.[E] "There are no high kicks or acrobatics here," he says. "It is hard to convince boys to spend many years learning something that won't make them wealthy or famous."[F] Hu's students have little. They sleep in unheated rooms and train outside no matter what the temperature. They hit trees with their bare hands and take turns sitting on each other's shoulders to build leg strength. Why such hardship? To master kung fu, they must learn respect, and how to "eat bitterness," a Mandarin expression meaning "to endure suffering." The life of a Shaolin master, Hu teaches, is not easy or attractive.[G] Master Hu is in a difficult position. For old traditions to survive, the young must learn. Gradually, he has begun offering a few courses in kickboxing and the acrobatic kung fu forms, hoping to attract new students. Then, maybe, he'll be able to convince them to learn Shaolin kung fu the traditional way. What word from paragraph A means the same as forms?

An audit partner is considering going concern for a client. The client's business has suffered due to COVID 19 lockdowns and general economic conditions in its industry, and analysts believe that the industry will not fully recover for the next 18-24 months. As a result, the client is unable to meet all of its financial obligations, and the future of the company is in doubt. The company has been an audit client for the last six years, and the partner has developed a strong professional and personal relationship with its CEO over this period. The company has received "clean" audit opinions on its financial statements for the past six years. At the end of the current year audit engagement, the partner consulted with the audit firm's quality control partner on the audit and decided that the only alternative for this year's audit of was to add a going-concern explanatory paragraph to the audit report. The partner informed the client's CEO of the decision, and the CEO replied that a going-concern explanatory paragraph would become a "self-fulfilling prophecy" that would ultimately damage the company, leading to its failure and the loss of numerous jobs. Required: Answer the following questions in detail. Be as specific as possible.  What are the audit partner's options at this point? What does the client CEO mean by "self-fulfilling prophecy"? What are the implications to the partner, the audit firm, and the client of not including an explanatory paragraph in the audit report? What are the auditing and ethical issues related to the partner's relationship with the CEO?

The questions[Q1 - Q8] below should be answered in the context of the following text Description: Consider the safety feature of a medical device that delivers drug to a patient (the system) as soon as the nurse starts it. The safety feature turns on a silent alarm (i.e. flashing light but no sound) and stops the patient's drug delivery (i.e. it stops the pump) in unsafe situations. Such unsafe situations are: 1) the values from the sensor that reads patient data are out of range (invalid), 2) the patient signals (using a "panic button") to the system that something is wrong. If more than 10 seconds (this time is called false alarm time) elapsed since the silent alarm was turned on, then an audible alarm is turned on. If the sensor provides values within range, or if the nurse clears the alarm, or if the patient had signaled that something is wrong but now signals that everything is ok (using an "ok button"), any alarm stops and the system turns drug delivery on again. In addition to the safety feature described above, the system can be configured by the nurse. For example, the false alarm time can be changed, with valid values between 5 and 30 seconds. The validity of all provided values is checked by the system. If the value is invalid, the system displays an error and asks the nurse to provide another value. Once the new value has been accepted, the nurse can choose to instruct the system to turn on the silent alarm for as many seconds as the new value indicates, then the silent alarm will be followed by a short audible alarm (default 2 seconds) as a test that it works properly. The time for the audible alarm can also be configured. The system can also be set to maintenance mode during which the nurse can use the system's pump to clean the intravenous line through which drug is delivered. During this mode, the sensors and alarms are turned off and cannot be activated, so that the nurse can work with the pump without risking accidental alarms. The capability of configuring the system is also turned off in maintenance mode. Interfaces: The system (aka "the work"), interfaces with the external components listed below. The system receives stimuli (input) and/or sends output to these entities, as follows:   [I1] The system shall interface with a component called Alarm. The Alarm accepts the following system output:  StartSilentAlarm  i.e. the alarm is on, but it is silent because the nurse has 15 seconds to check if it is a false alarm or a real alarm   StartAudibleAlarm  i.e. the alarm is real (which means it is not a false alarm), so the sound should be turned on    [I2] The system shall interface with a component called Keypad. The Keypad produces the following stimuli:  ClearAlarm  i.e. the user can clear (turn off) any alarm    [I3] The system shall interface with a component called Pump. The pump accepts the following system output:  ResetDrugDelivery  i.e. the pump should be started as soon as the system is started   StopDrugDelivery  i.e. the pump must be stopped if there is a real alarm    [I4] The system shall interface with a component called Sensor. The sensor produces the following stimuli:  ValueInRange  i.e. a valid value was received.   ValueOutOfRange  i.e. an invalid value was received, e.g. because the sensor is not attached to the patient.    [I5] The system shall interface with a component called Timer. The timer produces the following stimuli:  TimerExpires   i.e. the timer expires (goes off) 10 seconds after StartSilenceAlarm in order to StartAudibleAlarm unless the nurse clicks the clear alarm button.    [I6] The Timer accepts the following system output:  StartTimer - Start means that the timer is first reset and then starts StopTimer    Any desktop drawing tool (except for powerpoint and word) can be used for diagrams.

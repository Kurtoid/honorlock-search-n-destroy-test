(Chapter 22) Branded Shoe Company manufactures only one type of shoe and has two divisions, the Stitching Division and the Polishing Division. The Stitching Division manufactures shoes for the Polishing Division, which completes the shoes and sells them to retailers. The Stitching Division "sells" shoes to the Polishing Division. The market price for the Polishing Division to purchase a pair of shoes is $51. (Ignore changes in inventory.) The fixed costs for the Stitching Division are assumed to be the same over the range of 40,000-110,000 units.

A distribution of point charges is placed on the coordinate system shown below. The axis is marked in meters. Assume the potential infinitely far from the origin is zero.   a) Calculate the electric potential due to the distribution of charges at point P, which is located at the origin. b) Find the electric potential at r= 8mi+4mj (8m, 4m) labeled as P' in the figure. c) A charge qc = -1.965x10-3 C is placed at the origin and is moved infinitely far away. What is the change in potential energy for qc. d) First of all, qc is removed from the origin. Then a charge of qd=8.65x10-7 C is placed at P'. What is the change in potential energy in moving this charge to the origin? part a) V1 =-3.182 x107 V V2 =1.659x107 V V3 =5.529 x106 V VP =-9.699x106 V part b) 9. Find the contribution to the electric potential at point P' due to charge q3.  Write your answer in scientific notation, and enter the coefficient, rounding to 3 decimal places. Do not include units, and put a minus sign if negative. V3' =         x106 V

Linnea brushes her hair at least 18 times a day.  Each time, she uses exactly 47 strokes on the left side of her head and 47 strokes on the right.  Before she goes outside, she must brush her hair twice again with two different brushes, or else she feels increasingly anxious.  Linnea probably suffers from a(n) _______________ Disorder.

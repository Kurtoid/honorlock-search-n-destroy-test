You calculate map distances between genes A, B, and C in a series of dihybrid crosses. When you perform the trihybrid cross to verify your results, you discover that, despite analysis of a very large number of progeny, you have fewer double crossover progeny than would be predicted from the product rule. Which explanation is the most reasonable?

A remote-controlled toy car accelerates from rest with constant acceleration, a, under the power of its own wheels on a horizontal balcony until it shoots off the edge of the balcony a distance d = 2.0 m from its starting point as shown in the figure (not to scale). If  the balcony is h = 10 m high and the horizontal distance from the point it left the balcony to where the car lands on level ground is d = 2.00 m, what was the initial  acceleration, a, of the car (in m/s2)?

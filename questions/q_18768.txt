The next few questions pertain to the New Balance case study below.  Read the following case carefully and answer the case study questions that follow.                           new balance: attaining a balance in marketing strategy The U.S. athletic footwear market is likely to grow slowly from 2015 to 2020, according to a recently published report from the research company, Mintel International. This is due to the factors such as overly complex manufacturer-retailer relationships that sap brand loyalty. However, there is one bright spot in Mintel's consumer research, respondents overwhelmingly agree that they are willing to "spend money on good sneakers."   Jim Davis, chair of the New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc. is trying to appeal to those consumers identified in Mintel's research. New Balance rose quickly; starting mid-1990's to become the third-largest seller in of athletic shoes, but New Balance is learning that it must keep up with market changes to improve its market share and profits.  In order to increase the market share of New Balance, Jim Davis is proposing to increase the promotion of the brand by looking at event sponsorships and promotions as a way to gain notoriety for its product. Some of the events included the Chicago Marathon, the title sponsorship for the national indoor track and field championships in New York, various walking organizations, and the U.S. modern pentathlon team. An alternative strategy is to boost media spending. Most of the increase would be allotted for television advertising of men's running and cross-training shoes. New Balance also would run print ads highlighting men's and women's running shoes and women's walking shoes.    A market research project was put into place in order to choose which strategy will prove to be more effective. Researchers conducted 500 surveys to potential customers (35- to 64-year-old adults) who live in Chicago and New York. The purpose of the survey was to describe the overall attitude towards both promotional ideas and to determine which promotional strategy is likely to reach a higher percentage of interest and sales among the target market.    Which of the following best describes New Balance's problem /opportunity?

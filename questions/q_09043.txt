Researchers at Gallup chose a random sample of 1,020 American adults, who were aged 18 and older.  The 1020 American adults were asked to respond to the following question: "Please tell me how much trust you have in banks." Gallup reported that 36% of the 1,020 adults indicated that they had very little or no trust in banks. The margin of error for a 95% confidence interval calculated using this sample was 2.8%. What does the margin of error represent?

QUESTION 6             While playing golf, players use different golf clubs, depending on the distance the ball needs to travel. Different golf clubs produce different launch angles for the ball. A golf club strikes a ball. The ball leaves the golf club at an angle of 26deg to the horizontal and at a speed of 35 m.s-1.                       6.1   Calculate the horizontal distance that the golf ball should travel before reaching the ground.   (4)                   6.2   The path of the golf ball is shown below. Copy and add to the diagram to show the path the ball would have taken had it left the golf club, at the same speed, at an angle of 45deg to the horizontal.             Right click on the button to open the diagram in a new window.                         6.3   The actual horizontal distance travelled by the ball is affected by air resistance and an upwards force caused by the spin of the ball as it moves through the air. Explain how each of these forces would have affected the distance calculated in 6.1 had they been considered.   (4)

Consider a mass-spring-damper system, whose differential equation is shown below, where f(t) is an input force applied to the mass. Another department at our company, Real 1s Engineering, has already bought a damper with damping coefficient b, and the mass, m, is not subject to change. It is desired for the mass to reach its final position as quickly as possible with no overshoot. It is our job to choose a spring with spring constant k to achieve this. Find k. A schematic of the system is shown for your convenience. (Submit your work for partial credit.) (Hint: Not one number, not one problem)

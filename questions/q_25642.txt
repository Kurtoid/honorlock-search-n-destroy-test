[Essay] The New Deal revolution originally emerged as an objection to the Supreme Court's efforts to limit the federal and state governments from dealing with the economic crisis caused by the Great Depression. The main criticism was directed against the conservative judicial activism that failed to present a justifiable distinction between the prioritization of economic freedoms (such as the freedom of contract) above all other constitutional rights. New Deal liberals, however, eventually developed their own 'double standard' in applying a much tougher test--of strict scrutiny--against legislation that impinges on First Amendment freedoms or equal protection, while being deferential when it comes to economic regulations. Is the New Deal double-standard any more constitutionally justifiable than the old double-standard of the Lochner era? To what extent should the Constitution be open to the selective prioritization of certain types of rights and liberties over others?

Assume that the following equations characterize a large open economy: (1) Y = 5,000 (2) Y = C + I + G + NX (3) C = 1/2(Y - T) (4) I = 2,000 - 100r (5) NX = 500 - 500e (6) CF = -100r (7) CF = NX (8) G = 1,500 (9) T = 1,000 Where NX is net exports, CF is net capital outflow, and e is the real exchange rate.  Solve these equations for the equilibrium values for net exports (NX), savings (S), investment (I), interest rate (r), and the real exchange rate (e).

Short answer questions. You must show work indicating production or consumption of molecules such as ATP or NADH in the various pathways involved in these questions.

If the liver is to make a molecule of glucose from alanine, how many molecules of alanine are required? How many ATP equivalents are required? (5 points) If instead of using the pyruvate for gluconeogenesis, the pyruvate entered the mitochondria, what would be produced (NADH, FADH2, ATP...) by the complete oxidation of a molecule of alanine to CO2?

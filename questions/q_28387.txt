Make sure when you plug a value in for a variable, you are doing it in parenthesis. This makes sure you correctly handle the negative sign.  Example: t2 when t=-4 To solve this, replace t with ( ) so you get ( )2 then plug the -4 in. Your expression should look like (-4)2. Evaluating this means (-4)(-4) because the exponent of 2 distributes on both the negative sign AND the number. Your solution is 16 because two negatives multiplied together make a positive If you have -42, this means -(4)(4); the exponent does NOT distribute to the negative because there is no parenthesis. The solution to this is -16. A much different outcome than (-4)2. Keep this in mind while you solving the upcoming questions.

The books also mentions another type of consistency called tight consistency as follows: "when an update operation is performed on one copy, the update should be propagated to all copies before a subsequent operation takes place, no matter at which copy that operation is initiated or performed. This type of consistency is sometimes informally (and imprecisely) referred to as tight consistency as provided by what is also called synchronous replication. The key idea is that an update is performed at all copies as a single atomic operation, or transaction." Why is tight consistency easier to implement than strict consistency?

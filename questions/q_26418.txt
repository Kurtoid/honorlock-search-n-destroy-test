Signal transduction pathways convert extracellular stimuli into specific cellular responses. Typically, signal transduction begins with a signal to a receptor and ends with a change in cell function. Sometimes, there is a cascade of signals within the cell. With each step of the cascade, the signal can be amplified, so a small signal can result in a large response. Eventually, the signal creates a change in the cell, either in the expression of the DNA in the nucleus or in the activity of enzymes in the cytoplasm. The passage of signals back and forth between different pathways is referred to as _________.

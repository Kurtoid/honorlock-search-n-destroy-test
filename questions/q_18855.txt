FLOWCHART Use this problem statement for BOTH the FLOWCHART and CODING Part of the CODING PROBLEM Problem: Make a flowchart and write a program that will be used to calculate the circumferences (2[?]r) of circles. This program will have a main and will use one function. The text below describes these functions: Main function responsibilities: The main function will prompt for and input the number of circles. The program will inform the user of how many circle dimensions should be entered with any details about how the number should be entered. The main function will then loop based upon the number of circles specified by the user. The following will occur for each iteration of the loop: (1) input the diameter, (2) call the GetCircumference Function and store result, and (3) display the diameter and the circumference. GetCircumference responsibilities: The function will take in as a parameter the diameter of the circle. The function will return -1 if the diameter is negative. The function will otherwise return the circumference of a circle with the given diameter. Sample Output:  Bold/underscore values are representative of user input. How many circles? 2 Enter the diameter of 2 circles in inches as integers. Diameter? 10 Circumference for a Diameter of 10 is 31.4 inches. Diameter? -10 Circumference for a Diameter of -10 is -1 inches. ==================================================== FLOWCHART: Using the conventions discussed in class, create a flowchart to model the main function solution and the GetCircumference solution.  Upload your flowchart as a pdf file.

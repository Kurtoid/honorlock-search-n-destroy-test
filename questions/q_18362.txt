To prove they provide adequate protection against head injuries, bicycle helmets must be able to withstand government impact tests without cracking more than 8% of the time. A new helmet design has just been introduced. The new helmet is thought to be more stylish than older helmets, but consumer groups are worried that it will crack more than 8% of the time.     300 of the new helmets are randomly sampled and tested. Of these sampled helmets, 29 of them cracked. Test the hypothesis that the new helmets will crack more than 8% time when enduring the impact tests. Assume independence. Use .05 as the level of significance.   Explain how each of the conditions of the Central Limit Theorem are met.

D&D is 'n rolspel speletjie - 'n storie in 'n wereld van swaardswaaiery en towery. Dit deel elemente van verbeeldingryke kinderspeletjies. Soos daardie speletjies, word D&D deur die verbeelding aangedryf. Dit gaan daaroor dat jy 'n toringhoe kasteel onder 'n stormagtige naghemel indink en jou verbeel hoe die fantasie avonturier op die uitdagings van die spel reageer. Anders as 'n spel van pure verbeelding, gee D&D stuktuur aan die stories en 'n manier om die gevolge van die avonturier se aksies te bepaal. Spelers rol 'n dobbelsteen om te bepaal of hul avonturiers 'n krans kan afskaal, wegrol van die blits van 'n magiese weerligstraal, of 'n ander gevaarlike taak kan uitrig. Die rol van die dobbelsteen bepaal ook waarhen die avonturier volgende gaan. [https://dnd.wizards.com/lore]

Read the following scenario to answer the following question(s).Malaria is a disease caused by parasitic protists in the genus Plasmodium. The parasite is transmitted to humans by female Anopheles mosquitoes. The Plasmodium parasite feeds on human red blood cells, eventually destroying them. Humans infected with malaria can exhibit many symptoms. Depending on the severity of the infection, these can range from fever, chills, sweating, and headaches to anemia and kidney failure. Ultimately, malaria can result in death. However, if time and money permit, once a person is infected, they can be treated with different antimalarial drugs. Two commonly used drugs are artemisinin and quinine. In addition, one way to prevent the spread of malaria is to apply pesticides to treat areas with Anopheles mosquitoes. The National Malaria Eradication Program began work in 1947 with the goal of eliminating malaria from the southern United States. In 1947, 15,000 cases of malaria were reported nationwide. By 1950, only 2,000 cases were reported, and by 1951, malaria was considered eradicated from the United States. Today, the disease is most common in Africa and South America, two continents that are highly impoverished. About one million people die from malaria every year, many of them children. In Africa, it is estimated that one in every five childhood deaths is due to malaria.Suppose production of the pesticides used to treat malaria is halted because the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has found that they are causing too much environmental damage to warrant continued use. In turn, this drives up the prices of artemisinin and quinine since they are now in higher demand. How might this affect those that live in South America and Africa?

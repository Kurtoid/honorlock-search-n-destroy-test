Write a function named "containsDoubles".  "containsDoubles" takes one parameter which will be an array. You may name the parameter "myarray". This is a suggestion. "containsDoubles" returns true IF any two elements in the array which are side-by-side are identical. "containsDoubles" returns false IF all side-by-side elements are different OR if the array contains 0 or 1 elements.  Examples. containsDoubles([1, 1, 2, 3]); // Returns true because there are two 1's side-by-sidecontainsDoubles([1, 2, 3, 3, 5]); // Returns true because there are two 3's side-by-sidecontainsDoubles([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // Returns false (no neighboring elements are the same)containsDoubles([1, 2, 1, 2, 1]); // Returns false (no neighboring elements are the same)containsDoubles([1]); // Returns false (list size is 1)containsDoubles([]); // Returns false (list size is 0) Here's how to lose points on this question:- Not using a function.- Not using parameters.- Not returning a value at the end of your function.- Using prompt, alert, or any other input or output mechanism besides parameters and return values.- Any of the above test cases produce unexpected results based on your approach.

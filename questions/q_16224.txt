Contrary to popular belief, Thomas  Edison was not born into poverty in a backwater mid-western frontier town. Actually he was born to middle-class parents in the lively port of Milan, Ohio, a community that next to Odessa, Russia, was the largest wheat shipping center in the world. In 1854, when little Edison was 7 years old, his family moved to Port Huron Michigan.During childhood learned eagerly by asking questions and reading numerous books. Unable to adapt himself to the routine of school, he quit three months after beginning when his teacher called him "addled". His mother a former teacher, continued his education through home schooling. At the age of 9 she gave him his first physics book. This book described scientific experiments that Edison could perform himself. young Edison was hooked! The next year he set up a chemical laboratory in his family's basement.By the age of 12, Edison had become a virtual adult. He had talked to his parents into letting him go to work selling newspapers, snacks, and candy on the railroad. To avoid  wasting time he moved  his basement laboratory to the baggage car and read in the public library during layovers in DetroitEdison filed papers with various inventions, from an electric vote recorder to a diplex and quadruplex telegraph. However, the invention for which he is best known is the commercial introduction of the incandescent lamp. He did not invent the lamp, but he did devise and manufacture the first lamp and electrical distribution system that could be operated economically together. This was by far much more significant than the invention of the lamp itself in promoting the general use of electricity.Edison was awarded a special Congressional gold mdeal in 1928 for his many contributions to the nation's welfare. He died at 9pm in October 1931.

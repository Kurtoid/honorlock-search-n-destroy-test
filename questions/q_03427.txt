She arrived to the interview on time and met with Laura, the editor at the paper. Laura explained that she would have just a few questions.   Laura: "Thanks for coming in, Naomi. Could you start off by telling me about yourself?" Naomi: "Thank you Laura! I grew up in Jacksonville, Florida with my parents and little brother. We lived near the beach, which I loved, because I love swimming. I also have a dog named Scruffy. We adopted him and we aren't exactly sure what kind he is, but he's super cute! I just finished my first year of college and I took some journalism courses. I even did a write up on the Arts Festival going on! I love art!  I really liked those classes and thought I could apply for this job. Now here I am!" Laura: "Thank you, Naomi. Please tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a school project or in a previous job." Naomi: "........Well. I haven't had a lot of jobs yet, but I did work last summer at the GAP and this one time my boss told me that I needed to do this thing... what was it? Something with inventory. Anyways, I had to show up early, which I really hated, and help him with counting inventory and it took forever! All my coworkers were there too and one of them had this idea to do it better, and then I was like 'I think that we could do that but if we did it a little differently it would help us a lot!' Once we completed it my boss was really happy because he said that this is the most annoying thing he has to do all year." Laura: "Ok Naomi, this is the last question. Tell me about a time you overcame a difficult situation." Naomi: "Sure... So last year in college I had this really hard Psychology class. I thought I had studied for the first test well, but actually I hadn't really and I bombed it. Anyways, I met with the professor and she asked about how I studied. When I told her what I did with the definitions and how I had spent the whole night before cramming, she gave me some good advice about prioritizing my work, applying the ideas in class to my life, and turning off distractions during studying. I did these things and it really made a difference! I scored much better on the second test, and earned a B+ in the course overall!" Laura: "Thank you, Naomi. We will be in touch soon!" Imagine you are Laura. Would you hire Naomi? Remember that this is a position at a newspaper where she will be writing about local trends. What advice would you give to Naomi if she were to have another shot? Think about what Naomi could have expanded on, and what she should have left out.

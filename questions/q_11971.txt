DOCUMENTATION NOTE: For the practical, you may use any of the below files that already stored on your own computer. Below, some relevant documentation is provided through both external and internal links. The external links are meant to provide access to a more complete version of the relevant documentation, whereas the internal links are meant to provide access to a minimal amount of documentation, so that the relevant content may hopefully be loaded more quickly. (Also, it was not possible to provide a reliable external link for some documentation. For such documentation, an internal link is provided.) When accessing documentation via an external link, another tab should be opened within your web browser. It is likely that you will need to use a keyboard shortcut to switch between multiple open tabs. The keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+Tab" should rotate the active tab to the right, and "Ctrl+Shift+Tab" should rotate the active tab to the left. If these keyboard shortcuts do not work for you, contact some relevant course staff member(s). When accessing documentation via an internal link, select the down arrow () and then select "Preview".  To search for some keyword within some document, select anything within the relevant window and type "Ctrl+f" (or "Cmd+f", if MacOS is utilized) on the connected keyboard.

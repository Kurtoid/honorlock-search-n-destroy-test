Suppose we have a magnetic disk (resembling an IBM Microdrive) with the following parameters:   Average seek time: 12ms Rotation rate: 3600RPM Transfer rate: 3.5 MB/second # of sectors per track: 64 Sector size: 512 bytes Controller overhead: 5.5ms   Answer the following questions (assume that KB = 210 bytes, MB = 220 bytes and half a rotation is the average case).   (a) What is the average time to read a single sector (in milliseconds)? (b) What is the average time to read 8 KB in 16 consecutive sectors in the same cylinder? (c) Now suppose we have an array of 4 of these disks. They are all synchronized such that the arms on all the disks are always on the same sector within the track. The data is striped across the 4 disks so that 4 logically consecutive sectors can be read in parallel. What is the average time to read 32 consecutive KB from the disk array?

There is only one question on this test that requires notation - you are prompted for that notation in the question.  Additionally, you should NOT need to be rounding any answers. You MUST show work for each problem on your paper and answers must be included in Canvas for any credit to be awarded.  You do NOT have to use proper formatting (radicals, variable in denominator, etc) for Canvas answers, as long as you do so on your paper.  Your work MUST be scanned BEFORE you submit your test and disconnect from Honorlock.  TEN minutes have been built into your test time to account for this. If needed, you may access the Desmos scientific calculator by clicking here.

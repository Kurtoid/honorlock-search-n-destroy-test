Complete the Excel spreadsheet showing the following items: (1) the initial COVID cases on 03/17/2020 (U.S. population multiplied by initial infection rate). (2) the COVID cases on the 1st day of each month (U.S. population multiplied by corresponding infection rate). (3) the % change in infection rate (change in infection rate as a percentage of the previous day's infection rate). Note: you can use the infection rate of 03/17/2020 to calculate the % change for 04/01/2020. (4) the % change in overall COVID cases (change in COVID cases as a percentage of the initial case on 03/17/2020).  The formulas should be written such that the values highlighted in blue change automatically (and correctly) if the values highlighted in yellow are changed. Note: this is an Excel spreadsheet problem and no programming is required. Once complete, please type a one-word essay (e.g., "ok") for this question and then upload your combined Excel file at the very end of this exam.

After two unsuccessful attempts to advance the catheter into the bladder, you stop and notified the ED physician that you are unable to pass the catheter. It is imperative that the catheter never be forced, or internal trauma with resultant inflammation and bleeding can occur, making additional attempts at catheterization more difficult. S.M. might have some prostatic enlargement, which makes it more difficult to pass the catheter up to the bladder.The ED physician provides an order to insert a coude catheter . The coude catheter has a curved tip at the distal end that allows for easier passage in the male patient around the enlarged prostate. The curve should be facing upward toward the sky when a coude catheter is being inserted.  You watch the urine drain into the bag and note that the amount is approaching 500 mL.

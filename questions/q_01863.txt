(**Don't overthink this one!  You have four changes to make and four ways to make changes where each one must be used once!  That means each change is a different way listed above.)   Paragraph:      Jealousy is like a poison.  My last girlfriend was a beautiful woman.  She swore she had not a drop of jealous blood.  At first, she was understanding and tolerant of the time I spent without her.  Then I noticed a slight change.  She would check my eyes carefully.  She tried to detect any lies about my social activities.  This subtle surveillance made me somewhat uneasy.  Antonio was my best friend.  He advised me to break off the relationship.  Antonio said I would soon see my girlfriend become more possessive.  I was blinded by my infatuation.  I hoped that my girlfriend would change.  She did, but the change made me jealous.  She left me when she found someone she liked better.

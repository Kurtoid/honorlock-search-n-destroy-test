For your final exam, you will be creating an annotated bibliography in MLA format. Your topic for this exam can be either of the topics you wrote about in essay 1 or in essay 2. I'm asking you to image that you are doing research in order to turn the essay you have written into a research paper. (Note: you will not be actually writing the research paper; you are only the completing this research step). You are required to use the PRCC database Ebscohost (Academic Search Premier) to find a minimum of 5 articles for your annotated bibliography. For each of your five sources, you should include the following items: the MLA citation, a 3-5 sentence summary of what the article is about, a statement of use explaining what you would use the source within your essay to help you prove or support, and finally include a direct quote you might use from this source within your essay (the one you have already written). Be sure you also include an intext citation for this direct quote (Author's last name and the specific page number of the quoted material).  You can, of course, use the library databases and anything else within our course. I have posted for you an instructional video as well as an example of how you should type your final copy (double spaced with hanging indented format).  You will have 2 hours to complete this assignment. When you finish, be sure to upload your file here so I can grade your work.

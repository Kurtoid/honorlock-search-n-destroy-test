[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).] A box weighing 654-N is sliding down an inclined ramp.  Ms. Strong grabs at a rope on the box and tries to stop the sliding.   Shortly after grabbing the rope, the is sliding down the ramp at an angle  = 33 degrees from horizontal.  The woman is applying a force, F1, directed parallel to the ramp in the direction towards the top of the ramp, such that the box is now moving down the ramp and slowing down at a rate of 2 m/s2.  The coefficient of static friction between the ramp and the box is 0.900 and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the ramp and the box is 0.600.      a. (4 pts) Draw an FBD of the box during the time described and choose/label an appropriate coordinate system.   b. (12 pts) Determine the size of the woman's force, F1.  Enter your answer in the box below.  Write out your calculations on paper (blank paper or a blank problem-solving template). c. (4 pts) If the angle were changed to 45 degrees, what would happen to each force acting on the box- increase, decrease, or stay the same size?  Give your answers and explanation in the box below.  Your Answer:

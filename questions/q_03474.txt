In mice, agouti fur is a dominant trait resulting in individual hairs having a light band of pigment on an otherwise dark hair shaft. A mouse with agouti fur is shown here, along with a mouse with solid color fur, which is the recessive phenotype (A = agouti; a = solid color). In addition to A and a, the "agouti" gene has a third allele, AY . Here is some information about the inheritance of the AY allele.  The AY allele is dominant to both A and a. The homozygous genotype (AYAY ) results in lethality before birth. The heterozygous genotypes (AYA or AYa) result in yellow fur color, regardless of which alleles are present for the B/b gene. (This effect exhibited by the AY allele is known as epistasis--when the expression of one gene masks the expression of a second gene.)  A separate gene, which is not linked to the agouti gene, can result in either a dominant black pigment or a recessive brown pigment (B = black; b = brown). In a mating of mice with the genotypes AYaBb x AYaBb , what is the probability that a live-born offspring will have yellow fur? Express your answer as a decimal.

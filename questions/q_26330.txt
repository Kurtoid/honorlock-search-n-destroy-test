Adult Ascidiacea (sea squirts) feed similarly to sponges, by pumping water through their bodies and filtering out the tiny microorganisms and other organic particles (although sponges are more efficient at capturing the very tiny bacteria-sized particles).
Brody Corp. uses a process costing system in which direct materials are added at the beginning of the process and conversion costs are incurred uniformly throughout the process. Beginning inventory for January consisted of 1,300 units that were 40% completed. 13,000 units were started into the process during January. On January 31, the inventory consisted of 650 units that were 70% completed. What would be the equivalent units for conversion cost using the weighted average method?

A student releases a ball from a height of 100 cm above the ground. The ball bounces to a height of 80 cm. The diagram below shows the ball's position at five different times from its starting point to its maximum height after the first bounce. Use the diagram to address the questions below.  A. Explain why the ball has kinetic energy at positions 2 and 4. B. Describe the energy transformation that occurs from position 1 to position 2 and from position 4 to position 5. C. As the ball falls from position 1 to position 3, determine the height at which the ball has approximately equal amounts of kinetic energy and potential energy. Include units in your answer. D. Why doesn't the ball bounce back to the original position of 100 cm? Relate this to the Law of Conservation of Energy.

Download: FormulaSheet_FinalExam.pdf  Question#1 - [5 points]: A Zener shunt regulator circuit below has a DC power supply VS = 24 V with the source resistance RS = 250 O. In this circuit, a Zener diode BZX55C15 with the Zener voltage of 15 V is used. This Zener diode requires a minimum current of 1 mA to operate in the breakdown region and its maximum power dissipation rating is 500 mW. What are the minimum and maximum values of the load resistance RL in order to properly operate this circuit as a voltage regulator?

The rate of photosynthesis (Graph A) and the amount of carbohydrate present (Graph B), an indication of photosynthetic production of sugars, were determined in sponges exposed to current temperature and pH (control) or to one of three test groups: the expected pH in 2100 (test group 1), the expected temperature in 2100 (test group 2), or both (test group 3).(Note: Significant difference between groups is denoted by a different letter above the bars; if two groups share the same letter, they are not statistically different.)

Dr. Cotta is interested in the causes of behavioral problems among children. To study this, she employs the "Behavioral Tendencies" scale, which uses parents' and teachers' ratings to score children on a scale of 1-70. (Higher scores indicate more behavioral problems.) The population mean on this scale is 29.87. Dr. Cotta suspects that one of the many causes of behavioral problems is a stressful home environment.             She gathers a random sample of 100 children who have been classified as living in a stressful home. For this sample the mean score on the Behavioral Tendencies scale is 36.95. She computes the following test statistic: t = 1.66. If Dr. Cotta conducted a one-tailed hypothesis test (a = .05), a) what decision should she make regarding the null hypothesis? b) Then in "plain English" what does this tell her about the effects of a stressful home environment on behavioral problems? Make sure you include the statistics in APA format.

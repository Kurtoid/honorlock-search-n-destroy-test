When your exam is over (at 4pm for most of you), do the following:  Scan the scratch pages that you used (using Camscanner or equivalent), to create a single PDF file. Be sure to scan ALL of the pages that you wrote on. Pages not scanned will not be graded! Open the file on your phone to be sure that it has what you want. Place your scan in the chosen cloud storage folder. From your computer, upload your scan as requested from your cloud storage folder to your Canvas/Honorlock exam.  Submit your exam by selecting the "Submit Quiz" below. Close your Zoom session and enjoy ... 3701 is over!

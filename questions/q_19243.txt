Paula loves to buy run down rental properties to fix and flip.  She does a great job renovating and sometimes even adding additional rental units within the footprint of the same building.  Paula closed on a building last week that needs a lot of work.  The electrical is in bad shape and the service to the property is inadequate given modern needs for electricity.  The water and sewer connections are deteriorated and there are actual sinkholes in the basement from broken pipes.  The heating system (hot water boiler) is so old that replacement parts are no longer available.  The renovations will certainly require the opening up of walls and that is going to be expensive as there is most certainly asbestos throughout this building (though exactly where will be a bit of a mystery).  There are 9 tenants in the building and 3 already empty units.  Paula needs you to empty the rest of the building asap.  Only one of the tenants has a fixed term lease ending in 11 months (Oct 31 2021).  Given the objectives, what statement is most correct. For the purposes of this question today is November 29, 2020.

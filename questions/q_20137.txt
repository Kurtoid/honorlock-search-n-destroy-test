Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr A sample of gas collected at 21.0degC and 660 mm Hg, has a volume of 1.83 liters. What will the pressure of the gas be if the temperature is increased to 38.0degC and the volume is reduced to1.50 liters? To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem.  Show your work (equation/and units) by using the equation editor () in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use   to insert ratios. Be sure to include proper units and the final answer! Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

A large furnace flue operating at 440oC was made from low-alloy steel. After 2 years in service, the specimens were removed from the flue and fracture toughness tests were carried out at room temperature.  The average value of Kc was only about 30 MN/m3/2 compared to a value when new of about 80.  The loss in toughness was due to temper embrittlement caused by the impurity phosphorous.  The skin of the flue was made from plate 10 mm thick.  Owing to the self-weight of the flue the plate has to withstand primary membrane stresses up to 60 MN/m2.  Estimate the length of through-thickness crack that will lead to the fracture of the flue when the plan is shut down.

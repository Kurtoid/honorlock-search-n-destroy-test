The engineer is redesigning a wing component for a new aircraft after a failure during the full scale ground static load test.  The aluminum alloy has a plane strain fracture toughness of 40 MPa[?]m.  It has been determined that the fracture took place at a stress of 365 MPa when the maximum internal crack size is 5 mm.      a) (5 pts) In your words, please explain the plane stress and plane strain for fracture toughness measurement. Which condition yields higher fracture toughness? b) (5 pts) Stress intensity can be described as . Please explain the meaning of each variable. c) (5 pts) For the same component and Al alloy, compute the stress level at which fracture will occur for a critical internal crack length of 4 mm.

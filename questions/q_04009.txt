**Pick ONE of the essay questions below to answer (either a or b)** A)  Evaluating forage quality: One of the key take-home messages of this course is the importance of forage in equine diets. Therefore, it is important to understand how to evaluate forage quality, particularly since laboratory analysis of actual nutrient content is frequently unavailable. [1] Describe factors to consider when selecting hay and how these factors influence nutrient content. [2] Provide the type of hay, including a description of its visual characteristics that should be selected for: [a] a horse in intense work, and [b] a mature horse that is ridden infrequently. B] Post-Exercise Feeding:  Cookie Canuck competes with his string of Thoroughbreds horses in chuckwagon racing. In this event, a team of 4 horses pulls a western covered wagon through an obstacle course in the infield and then races out on to the track to run a 5/8-mile loop at top speed. The entire race takes only about 2 minutes. The biggest chuckwagon racing event is 10 days long and each team races every day. Cookie has noticed that his horses do well on the first few days, but by the 4th day and beyond, they seem to lose their steam. He's heard that a good post-exercise feeding strategy may help fix this problem. His horses race at 6:00PM. He's fearful of colic and founder, so when the horses return to the barn after the race, Cookie cools them down completely before offering them any water. He also waits a couple of hours after the race and then gives them 2 flakes of alfalfa. At 11:00PM, he gives them 2 pounds of whole oats. [1] Explain how Cookie's current post-exercise feeding program could be contributing to the waning of his horses' energy; and [2] Develop a post-exercise feeding strategy for Cookie that details what should he feed after the race, when he should feed it, and why he should feed that way.

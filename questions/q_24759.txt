"Number six, the reaction of his fellow 50 players had to be right. "In Jackie Robinson, we found the man to take care of points one and two. He was eminently right off and on the field. We did not settle on Robinson until after 55 we had invested $25,000 in scouting for a man whose name we did not then know."

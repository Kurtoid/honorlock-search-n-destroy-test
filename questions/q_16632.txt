Puddle Ponds   During the summer, a small pond loses water to evaporation. Eventually, this pond becomes a series of puddles separated from one another by at least several meters. Most animals disperse or die as the pond dries, but some microbes still remain in the puddles. Each of these species used to live in the pond as a much larger population, but are now subpopulations that reside in the puddles. Some of the microscopic species with short generations are bacteria, paramecia, and rotifers. All of these species reproduce asexually, except for one species of rotifer that reproduces sexually. The puddles remain separated until the following spring, when abundant rain causes them to expand and form a pond like the one from last year.      Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 6-10.   6. During the time that subpopulation lived in puddles, they would have been considered sympatric.

A random sample of n = 30 individuals participated in a college success program that assessed student success. Each individual student completed 4 different assessments of student success (after 1st semester, 2nd semester, 3rd semester, and 4th semester). The data were analyzed to determine whether student grades improved or worsened over time. Some of the results are presented in the following summary table.  a. Complete the table by filling in the missing values.    Source SS df MS     F = [F-ratio]   Between Groups [SSBG] [dfBG] 9   Within Groups [SSWG] [dfWG]          Between Subjects 96 [dfbs]          Error [SSerror] [dferror] 2   Total 297 [dfTotal]       b.

Regression Multi-Part A: A movie studio has developed a model to ascertain customer satisfaction with villains. They conducted a study where overall satisfaction with a movie was the dependent variable, and different characteristics of the villain were the attributes. Respondents used a 5-point satisfaction scale to express their overall satisfaction, and four attributes (1 = extremely dissatisfied, 5 = extremely satisfied).

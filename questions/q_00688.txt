The presence of two copies of the X-chromosome in females but only one in males poses a potential problem for regulation of gene expression: everything else being equal, the higher copy number of the X-linked genes can lead to an imbalanced overproduction of their products in females compared to males. Organisms have evolved different ______  mechanisms to solve this problem. In mammals, for example, the almost complete inactivation of one of the X chromosomes provides the solution to the dosage problem.

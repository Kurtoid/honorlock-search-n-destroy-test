You are participating in your Anatomy/Physiology lab on respiratory physiology.  One of the first activities of this lab is to listen to breathing sounds on your lab partner using a stethoscope.  Which of the following statements is accurate regarding normal events that occur during inspiration and expiration?    The contraction of the respiratory muscles is caused by a drop in intrapulmonary pressure; this drop in Ppul causes air to flow out of the lungs into the atmosphere.     When the diaphragm relaxes, air will ultimately leave the alveoli and enter the bronchial tree.     The phrenic nerve delivers nerve signals to the external intercostal muscles; this causes intrapulmonary pressure to increase which will drive inspiration.      The increase in thoracic cavity volume is caused by the relaxation of the respiratory muscles.  This increase in volume will result in an increase in intrapulmonary pressure leading to expiration.      Inspiration is caused by the contraction of the diaphragm and expiration is caused by the contraction of the external intercostal muscles.  These muscles are therefore working as antagonists.

Fill in the blank I:  For Questions #1-10, fill in the blank with the appropriate choice from the list of terms below.  Only the best answer will count as the correct answer.  Each answer is used only once in this section.  You may find it useful to decide on your answer before looking for your choice in the list of terms.  If there are two blanks in a question, the same answer is used in both blanks  As described in the Gardner book chapter, ________ proposed that "every child passes through roughly the same stages [of cognitive development] in the same order...each stage involves a fundamental reorganization of knowledge, a reorganization so profound that the child does not even have access to her earlier forms of understanding. Once he is out of a stage, it is as if the prior stage had never happened." [Note: This sentence is an exact quote from the Gardner reading. Alternate use of "she/he" and "her/his" is a convention used in scholarly publications about children.] According to Piaget, young children work hard to create knowledge and are active agents in the creation of their increasing cognitive power. He proposed that during the first two years of life, infants move from _____behavior to intelligent behavior in six stages. According to Piaget, during the pre-operational period (2-7 years of age) children focus on one aspect of a problem only and perceive a liquid as changing in quantity when the shape of the container changes (even though the volume remains the same). During the period of concrete ______ (7-11 years of age) children are able to keep in mind more than one feature of the problem. A 10-year old child can conserve the volume of a liquid as it is poured from a short, wide container into a tall, thin container. According to a HRAF study by Barbara Rogoff, many cultures recognize that changes which occur during the period of 5-7 years (the "5-7 year shift") make it possible to assign roles and responsibilities to children and to assume that children are now ________. Mel Konner and other anthropologists have suggested that the lengthening of the _________ stage is a major reason that human children are able to acquire such vast quantities of cultural content.  Konner refers to this period as "a vessel into which knowledge, skill, and tradition can be steadily and reliably poured...imbuing a child with culture." Victoria Horner's blackbox vs. clearbox experiment with human children and juvenile _______ shows us that human children are biased to learn from other humans and will ignore direct sensory information in order to faithfully copy what they have been taught by an adult. In contrast, ______ are more attentive to new sensory information in front of them (if it helps them solve a problem more efficiently). Socially acquired information is less important to them than information directly acquired from the physical environment. In her study of immature savannah baboons (a type of Old World monkey), Barbara King concluded that each young baboon must acquire knowledge without help. Active donation of information by adults is not seen in non-human primates. In contrast, among humans, active ______ by adults greatly increases the amount of knowledge which children gain from adults. Traits which humans share with other members of the order _______ include grasping hands with nails, tactile pads, & touch receptors, stereoscopic & color vision, and the extensive use of visually-guided manual reaching during feeding. When children hang under tree branches, gym bars and "monkey" bars, they are using forelimb abilities shared only with __________ like chimpanzees, gorillas and gibbons but not seen in monkeys.  In addition to traits shared with other taxonomic groups, humans also have unique traits which are not found in other species.  _________is a stage-specific gait of human children which is rarely seen in adult humans and is not found in any other animal (it is both stage-specific and human-specific).   In the film Children of Heaven, Roya uses this bipedal gait as she travels from her school to her home.

12.  Below is the 5' to 3' sequence of DNA that codes for part of a helix-loop-helix protein. This portion of DNA codes         for either the loop or part of a helix.       a) Use the given base sequence to construct both the mRNA sequence coded by the DNA and the protein coded by the mRNA.  You may use 1- or 3-letter code for the protein sequence.  For 4 pts extra credit, you may construct the 3' to 5' DNA sequence from which the mRNA is built, but doing so is not necessary.  (6 pts - 3 pts mRNA; 3 pts protein)   5' to 3':  A T T C T T G A C A A A G C G A C T G A A T A T A T T C A G T A C A T G   3' to 5':   mRNA:   protein:        b) Examine the amino acid sequence you have found.  Does it code for a loop or an alpha-helix?  Point out three features of the amino acid sequence that support your conclusion.  (6 pts)

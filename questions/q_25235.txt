York College of Pennsylvania, as an institution of higher education, serves to promote and sustain the creation, acquisition, and dissemination of knowledge. In order to fulfill this purpose, an environment of integrity, dependability and honesty must be maintained by all members of the York College community. Without a foundation based on intellectual honesty and integrity, the very ability to uphold the academic endeavors that York College strives to pursue is inhibited. The Spartan Oath embodies the expectation that all members of the York College community foster an environment of integrity and responsibility. Recognize that adhering to an ethical standard of honesty leads to professional, mature and responsible citizens, and enables society at large to trust our scholarship, research, and conferred degrees. Thus, each member of the York College community must be truthful, honest, personally and professionally responsible, and respect the intellectual contributions of others. Definition of Academic Dishonesty Engaging in academic dishonesty is a violation of the school's academic integrity policy and is not tolerated at York College. Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarism (i.e. passing someone else's words or ideas off as one's own without proper attribution), improper paraphrasing, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, handing in material completed for another course, and submitting work not done independently (unless part of an explicitly collaborative project) (YCP 2019-2020 Undergraduate Catalog). Procedures for Academic Integrity Reporting and Appeals may be found in the College Catalog.

I also understand that my exams will be monitored and any suspicious activity will be reviewed to determine whether a charge of academic dishonesty will be made.  I have been provided with and watched a video that explains how to do an appropriate room scan and that failure to do so may result in a charge of academic dishonesty.

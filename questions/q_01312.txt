Some airlines hedge a large percentage of fuel costs and others do not.  With the COVID pandemic, many airline companies that did hedge fuel costs saw themselves facing large hedging losses because the price of fuel collapsed and the airlines hedged fuel costs for more jet fuel than they actually purchased (because flights were grounded).  The price of oil fell to $30 a barrel.  Airlines frequently hedge using oil since the marekts are more liquid and the price of oil is very highly correlated with the price of jet fuel. Firm A hedged by going long oil (taking delivery) at a futures price of $68 a barrel for 10 million barrels of oil Firm B hedged by buying call options with an exercise price of $68 on 10 million barrels of oil at a price of $6 per barrel Firm C did no hedging of fuel costs What is the correct order for the best outcome to the worst outcome during the COVID Spring and summer of 2020 given the $30 actual price outcome for oil a) Firm A did best, Firm B did second best, Firm C did the worst b) Firm A did the best,  Firm C did the second best, and Firm B did the worst c) Firm B did the best, Firm A did second best, and Firm C did the worst d) Firm B did the best, Firm C did second best, and Firm A did the worst e) Firm C did the best, Firm A did the second best, and Firm B did the worst f) Firm C did the best, Firm B did the second best, and Firm C did the worst
Over the past decade, brands that were once available only to the wealthy have created more affordable product extensions, giving a far broader range of consumers a taste of the good life.

A Caucasian couple is concerned that their unborn baby will have cystic fibrosis (CF). They already have a 4-year-old daughter. A dot blot analysis is performed to genotype the family for the F508 deletion in the CFTR gene. Probes complementary to the region spanning the F508del and to the wild type (WT) sequence in that region (WT) are spotted onto a membrane.  The membrane was then separated into four strips and hybridized to amplified CFTR DNA obtained from each parent, their 4yo daughter (child) and the fetus.  The results are shown in the figure (black indicates a positive hybridization result). Which of the following can be concluded from the dot blot analysis?

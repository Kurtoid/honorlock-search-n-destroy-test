Refer to the excerpt below to answer the following question:     We . . . sat down among the rocks and talked over the enterprise which was about to be undertaken.  The taking of Harper's Ferry, of which Captain Brown had merely hinted before, was now declared as his settled purpose, and he wanted to know what I thought of it.  I at once opposed the measure with all the arguments at my command.  To me, such a measure would be fatal to running off slaves, as was the original plan, and fatal to all engaged in doing so.  It would be an attack upon the Federal Government, and would array the whole country against us. . . . I told him, and these were my words, that all his arguments, and all his descriptions of the place, convinced me that he was going into a perfect steel-trap, and that once in he would never get out alive; that he would be surrounded at once and escape would be impossible.  He was not to be shaken by anything I could say, but treated my views respectfully, . . .  I looked at him with some astonishment that he could rest upon a reed so weak.  --Frederick Douglass describes his last meeting with John Brown, about three weeks before the raid on Harper's Ferry.

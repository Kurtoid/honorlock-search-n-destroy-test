Tree diameters are related to "growth rings" in trees and larger diameters are associated with taller trees. The scatter plot of a survey of 958 trees in an old-growth forest in Canada showed evidence of a linear relation between tree height (m) and diameter (cm).   The resulting least squares regression line equation  Height = 2.79 + 0.55x Diameter has an R2 value of 0.92. Which of the following is the slope of the least squares regression line equation?

Write a tail-recursive function that converts a list of float Celsius temperatures to float Fahrenheit temperatures. The position of the Fahrenheit temperature in the output should match the position of the corresponding Celsius temperature in the input. You may not use any of the built-in List functions, except you may use rev, isEmpty, head and tail. You may not use sequences. The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is F = 9/5 * C + 32.

You perform a monohybrid cross of two flowering plants, where purple flowers are dominant over white flowers.  The two parents have the genotypes PP and pp, where PP has two alleles for purple flowers and pp has two alleles for white flowers.  You first cross the two monohybrid parents to produce F1 generation offspring.  You then cross two F1 individuals to produce F2 generation offspring.  Use this information and the Punnett Squares below to answer the following two questions.  You will need to draw these Punnett squares on a piece of paper and complete them in order to answer the next questions                    F1 Generation                                                                                                                                                F2 Generation

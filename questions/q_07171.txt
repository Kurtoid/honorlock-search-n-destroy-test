To control cockroaches many people use traps that contain glucose (a sugar) laced with poison. These traps work because cockroaches are attracted to sugars. In Germany, a mutation occurred in a single taste receptor gene in cockroaches that caused glucose to taste bitter. The allele for this trait is called Av for glucose aversion.  The original allele is called At for glucose attraction. Use the table below to calculate the selection coefficient for the AvAt genotype in Germany?     Genotype:   AvAv   AvAt   AtAt     Chance of survival to mating:   25%   50%   10%     Number of offspring produce if survive:   10   10   10     Reproductive average of an individual with that phenotype:   .25 x 10 = 2.5   .5 x 10 = 5   .1 x 10 = 1

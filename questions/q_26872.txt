Show all of your work to the proctor. Do this by holding up each piece of paper in front of your  camera, that you intend to upload in Canvas after the exam.   Within 30 minutes after completing the  exam, scan or take a picture of each paper containing relevant work and upload each under the appropriate test in Canvas. The link to do this may be found in Canvas attached to the study guide.  By uploading your  work, I am able to give partial credit on missed problems.  Some problems may require work to be shown for any credit.    Finally, please note that the automated grade for this test is NOT correct. I will be grading these exams by hand and providing feedback below the problems under the test. It may take roughly one week after you take the exam to receive your official score.

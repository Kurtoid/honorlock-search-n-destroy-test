The two radiographs below are two projections of the proximal metatarsus of the same horse who has suffered a fracture of one of her splint bones.  The fracture is evident at a level about  1/4  of the distance between the head and the button.  Each projection effectively highlights ONE of the TWO small splint bones (II or IV).  Based on your knowledge of approaches to therapy in various splint bones, which of the following could absolutely not be considered as a strategy for this horse? (Hint: the lateral radiograph is labeled as a lateral, but has been projected slightly like a lateral oblique, and therefore will highlight the splint bone most likely to be highlighted on a DLPMO view! Remember to review your radiographic anatomy)

A square metal plate is subjected to a proportional bi-axial loading as shown below.  The edge is 60 mm, and the thickness is 5mm.  Two strain gauges are placed at the center of the plate to measure the strain component e11 and e22.  a) If the material is a polycrystalline metal with homogeneous grain structure, the horizontal load P11 = 50 KN, and the vertical load P22 = 20 KN. The readings from the two gauges are e11 = 3.5 X 10-3 and e22 = 1 X 10-3, respectively. Please determine (1) the Young's modulus E, (2) Poisson's ratio n, and (3) through-thickness strain e33 b) If the material is a cubic single crystal with the loading lined up along unit cell axis, please describe how you can determine all the compliance components through the experiment. Your description needs to be in detail, including listing all the compliance components to be determine, and the experimental method.

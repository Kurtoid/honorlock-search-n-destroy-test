Craig and Claire would like to start saving for their daughter Gabriella's college education. Gabriella just turned 12 today at t = 0, and she will be entering college 6 years from now (at t = 6).  College tuition and expenses at Private U. are expected to be $50,000 at t = 6, $53,000 at t = 7, $55,000 at t = 8, and $58,000 at t = 9.  Gabriella will graduate 4 years after entering college. Currently, Craig and Claire have $25,000 in Gabriella's college fund.  They plan on depositing an equal annual amount into the fund starting one year from today (t = 1).  They will make 6 annual deposits into their daughter's college fund (that is, at t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).  Craig and Claire expect the college fund to earn an annual return of 8%.  Amounts that remain in the fund will continue to earn interest (at 8%) during the time their daughter is in college. How much do they need to deposit annually into the account to just have enough money to send their daughter through 4 years of college?

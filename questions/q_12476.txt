14  Use the formula W=fd, where f represents a force, and d represents the distance that the force is applied. Find W (the work done) where f = 1150 and d = 28. A)  W = 1,122                                          D)  W = 32,200 B)  W = 1,178                                           E)  W = 32,078 C)  W = 30,800

Read the following statements that describe what happens as an impulse travels. What is the correct order in which the steps occur?     1) The neuron receives a stimulus great enough to start an impulse.      2) Na+ gates close and K+ ions flow back out of the cell restoring the resting potential.     3) Gated K+ and Na+ channels are closed. The inside of the cell is slightly negative compared to the outside.      4) The impulse continues to travel down the axon away from the cell body.     5) Gated Na+ channels open. The net movement of Na+ ions into the cell produces the action potential.

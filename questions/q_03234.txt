Question 2Multipart question (Tests the Core outcomes 1 and 2) (Total 30 points)START THIS QUESTION ON A NEW PAGE. SEPARATE EACH PART NICELY!    Consider an electric car run by a dc motor. Assuming the TF from the motor voltage V (in volts) to the car speed v (in mph) has the form  . Here is some experimental information to find the values of b and p. When the car was at rest and you apply a voltage of 200Volt to the motor, the car eventually reached a speed of 40mph. The time it took to reach [?] 98% of 40mph was 3.6 seconds. Find b and p.  (10 points) For consistency: Please keep all the time units in hours. We shall attempt to make a very simplistic model of a (rear-wheel drive) electric car run by a dc motor.The armature resistance of the motor is R, the armature inductance is about 0, the motor torque and back emf constants are both K , and the rotational inertia of the motor's armature is 0. The total mass of the car is M and the car moves in the air with linear air drag cv . When you apply the voltage V to the motor, it provides a torque T and speed w to the input of the transmission. The transmission then delivers the torque to the rear wheels. The gear ratio of the (very light & frictionless) transmission is G . Assume the wheels too are very light and have radius r, and don't slip on the road.    Find the transfer function from the motor voltage V to the car speed v. (20 points)You'll have to draw the the FBD of the car, and a separate FBD of the rear car wheels, and a separate for the front car wheels. Some hints: Draw FBD of the rear wheels, how much torque are they getting?Also speed of the car, assuming no slipping of the wheel, is v=rww , where ww is the angular velocity of the wheels. In going from the motor to the wheels through the transmission, while the torque increases by a factor of G (assuming no friction and massless gears), the angular velocity decreases by the same factor G .

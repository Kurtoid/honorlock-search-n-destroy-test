Scenario: Read the following information about Kimo.  Think about development, developmental responsiveness, and appropriate responses to this situation based on middle school philosophy.  Kimo enters the room and knows many kids from his advisory class. The teacher tells the class to take out some paper and put their names on it.  She wants names in the upper left corner of the paper like all the teachers on his interdisciplinary team. Kimo panics when he realizes that this teacher wants all work in ink, and he already lost all twenty pens that his mother bought at Costco! But then he remembers that he can borrow a pen from the teacher from her "share cup".  The class is studying political elections. The students are conducting a mock election using an "electoral college" system.  The bell rings just as Kimo's was getting excited to understand the election process, but he knew that he would learn more in his next class English as they would also be talking about elections. As Kimo makes his way back across campus, some kids bump him and knock his books out of his hands. However, one of the students he knows from his team helps him pick them up.  Considering the middle school philosophy - what is one thing that the school has implemented that helped Kimo have a better day at school? Explain how that structure helped support Kimo's learning and overall well-being.

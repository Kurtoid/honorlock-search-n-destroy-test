SOURCE A: Because of the increasing presence of Islam in North Africa, many African people began to convert to Islam. They did this for several reasons. Early missionaries, such as Abdallah ibn Yasin, influenced thousands of Berbers (Ethnic groups) to accept Islam. Many Saharan Africans converted to Islam to protect themselves against being sold into slavery, which was a flourishing trade at the time. Some leaders converted to Islam to gain political support from the Arabs and to make commercial relationships easier. However, not all North Africans, such as the local Berber -speaking populations, automatically accepted Islam. In fact, Islam did not become the main religion across North Africa until the 12th century CE. Source: Module GR 7

For the following three questions (32-34), consider a study in which the investigators wished to evaluate the following two discriminators for their usefulness in screening for endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women: (1) thickening of the endometrium (uterine wall) as observed by ultrasound examination, and (2) elevated serum levels of cancer antigen-125 (CA125). The investigators chose a = 0.05 at the outset of the study, and measured endometrium thickness and serum CA125 concentration in 106 normal subjects and 95 patients with uterine cancer. The presence or absence of uterine cancer was confirmed by biopsy (the "gold standard" examination). The data for endometrium thickness are presented in the following table. The results of ROC analysis are shown in the table below.    Endometrium thickness (mm) Normal subjects Cancer patients  Discriminator Area under the curve (AUC)   >=30 0 5  Endometrium thickening 0.895   >=25 1 25  Elevated serum [CA125] 0.993   >=20 12 53      >=15 15 68      >=11 21 86      >=8 45 93      >=6 67 95      >=4 104 95      >=0 106 95                      Based on the results of ROC analysis, what is the most appropriate endometrium thickness cutoff value (threshold, in mm) above which patients should be recommended for biopsy?

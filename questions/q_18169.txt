Grandma Rose was getting a little frustrated with Fleur and remarked, "Fleur, you have all this academic knowledge, but you should consider the most likely thing first! The most common thing is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), so that's probably what is going on and I can't do anything about that." Fleur responded, "Grandma, I understand prioritizing potential diagnoses, but we shouldn't ignore things just because they are not the most likely!" The shock of standing up for herself in the face of the grandmother she respected so much, jolted a flashback from her time in Abidjan. She remembered being in a cold concrete bathroom, vomiting at the same time as she had diarrhea, and being so dehydrated that she could lift her skin over an inch above her hand. She had guessed she had cholera, but never understood how she survived her exposure to cholera toxin (CTX), even though she was eventually given an antibiotic with a syringe washed with tap water.  But after she recovered, she wondered if maybe she was heterozygous for a defective CFTR allele. Explain her reasoning behind this thought; that is, why might having one defective CFTR allele have allowed her to survive cholera? Be specific in describing your hypothesis or reasoning. For example, "CFTR protects against cholera" is not a sufficiently detailed explanation for this answer.

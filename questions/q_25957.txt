The Peace of Utrecht in 1713
A man and his nephew lived and worked together on the man's ranch for 15 years. The man developed severe arthritis as he grew older, and the nephew took over the daily work of running the ranch. The man told his nephew that he wanted to be sure that the ranch would go to the nephew when the man died, so he gave the nephew a quitclaim deed. The nephew did not record the deed, but locked it in a drawer in his desk. Six months later, the man's daughter learned about this. She asked her father to sell the ranch to her, saying he could continue to live there for the rest of his life. The daughter offered her father a good sum of money for the ranch, so the man agreed. The man and his daughter closed on the sale the next day. The man then told the nephew that he had changed his mind and decided to leave the ranch to his grandchildren. The nephew promised to destroy the deed, and the next week, he did. A month later, however, there was an accident at the ranch and the man and the nephew both died. The man died intestate and was survived by three children, including his daughter. The man's heirs, the nephew's heirs, and the daughter claim title to the ranch. The jurisdiction has a notice recording statute. If the nephew's heirs bring an appropriate action to quiet title to the ranch,who is likely to prevail?

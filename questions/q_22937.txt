You have been scouring The Wall Street Journal looking for stocks that are "good values"    and have calculated expected returns for five stocks. Assume the risk-free rate (rRF) is 4    percent and the market risk premium (rM - rRF) is 3.2 percent.  Which security would be the best   a. Expected Return = 9.01%, Beta = 0.8    b. Expected Return = 7.06%, Beta = -0.2   c. Expected Return = 5.04%, Beta = -0.2   d. Expected Return = 8.74%, Beta = 0.3   e. Expected Return = 11.50%, Beta = 0.5

A long vertical wire carries a steady 70 A current. As shown in the figure, a pair of horizontal rails are 0.20 m apart. A 20-O resistor connects points a and b, at the end of the rails. A bar is in contact with the rails, and is moved by an external force with a constant horizontal velocity of 0.90 m/s to the right, as shown. The bar and the rails have negligible resistance. At the instant that the bar is 0.20 m from the wire, what are the induced current in the resistor and its direction through the resistor? (m0 = 4p x 10-7 T [?] m/A)

The first parameter is a list of tuples where each tuple has three ingredients (strings) and the last element of the tuple states if the drink is hot or cold (string).

You may assume that the tuples will always contain four strings.  Example output: >>> recipes = [("milk", "mocha syrup", "espresso", "hot"), ("chai", "cinnamon", "almond milk", "hot"),("whipped cream", "espresso", "chocolate", "cold")]>>> preference = "cold">>> print(surpriseMe(recipes, preference))[("whipped cream", "espresso", "chocolate", "cold")]

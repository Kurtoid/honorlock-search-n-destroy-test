Gettysburg and Vicksburg           Two important Civil War battles were fought in the first days of July 1863.  General George Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on July 3 after three days of fierce fighting.  Total casualties were 51,000, around 30 percent of the men who fought.  Gettysburg was not of strategic importance as a location, but it had been an important part of Lee's strategy to win a decisive battle in the North.  Although Lee's army suffered heavy losses, they were not completely crushed by this defeat, and they escaped across the Potomac River into Virginia to carry on the war for nearly two more years.            Over on the Mississippi River, Union General Ulysses S. Grant finally achieved a victory over the important Confederate city of Vicksburg on July 4.  Vicksburg was located on a high bluff overlooking the Mississippi River and Confederate guns there controlled the river traffic.  Grant's campaign against Vicksburg had begun in the early spring and had ended with a forty-day siege.  Both the citizens and the soldiers suffered great hardships due to lack of food and other supplies and the almost constant shelling of the city by the Union artillery.  With his men in danger of starvation, the Confederate commander was forced to surrender.  Although the suffering was great, the loss of life was relatively small.  Grant took 30,000 prisoners whom he released on parole once they took an oath not to fight against the Union again.  With Grant's victory and Union control of the Mississippi, the Confederacy was split in half and the Union armies could turn their attention to subduing the Confederates in the East.        From the reading and your own knowledge, the battle of Vicksburg was different from the battle at Gettysburg because it

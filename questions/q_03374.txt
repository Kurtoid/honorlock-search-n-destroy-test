Use the standard reaction enthalpies given below to determine DHdegrxn for the following reaction:             4 NO(g) + 2 O2(g)  -  4 NO2(g)        DHdegrxn =  ? Given:             N2(g) + O2(g)  -  2 NO(g)                 DHdegrxn = +183 kJ              1/2 N2(g) + O2(g)  -  NO2(g)           DHdegrxn = +33 kJ

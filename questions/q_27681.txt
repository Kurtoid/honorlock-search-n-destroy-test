5)  Suppose you did a vinyl free radical polymerization using benzoyl peroxide as initiator, which leaves a C6H5COO- attached at both ends of the polymer chain (we will assume it terminates by a combination reaction). The following UV-Vis data was collected to calibrate the concentration of this functional group.  What would be the molecular weight of the polymer if 0.60 g/L of the polymer gave an absorbance reading of 0.80.  MW = ? g/mol

You are studying a new chemical that you believe has antimicrobial effects.  You use the Kibry-Bauer method to determine the effectiveness of the chemical.  Below are images representing four plates from your experiment.  A is plate without any bacterial growth.  B is a plate with a complete lawn of growth.  C is an experimental plate using E. coli as the experimental organism and D is an experimental plate using S. aureus as the experimental organism.  Based on these results, is the chemical antimicrobial and if so what is its spectrum?  Be sure to give evidence to support your answer.

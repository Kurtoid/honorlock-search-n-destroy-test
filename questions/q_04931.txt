You are given an array  of   distinct integers (indexed 1 through ) which are not arranged in any particular order. The objective is to determine the largest and the second largest  of these  integers (without sorting the whole array). Observe that the problem is trivial if  For the sake of simplicity, you can assume that   is a power of two. Develop an algorithm based on the divide and conquer principle to do so and express it in the form of pseudocode. Specifically, write a recursive function   that returns the largest  and second largest integer  in the portion of the array starting from index  to   using the divide and conquer principle.  Note that we can solve the original problem, by simply calling your function with parameters of  No need to analyze your algorithm.

A large sheet of material 50 mm thick contains dissolved hydrogen (H2) having a uniform concentration of 3 kmol/m3. The sheet is exposed to a fluid stream that causes the concentration of the dissolved hydrogen to be reduced suddenly to zero at both surfaces. This surface condition is maintained constant thereafter. If the mass diffusivity of hydrogen is 8 x 10-7 m2/s, how much time is required to bring the density of dissolved hydrogen to a value of 1.2 kg/m3 at the center of the sheet? Hints: Use the same transient equation available for temperature distribution in chapter 5  to solve for the concentration distribution.

A 10 year old comatose patient is in a long term care facility and has been on a ventilator for 8 years.  Secretion overproduction occurs in long term patients due to infection and irritation of the tracheostomy tube. The ventilator is connected via long tubing to a tracheostomy tube and as you walk into the patient's room, you notice a lot of thick white secretions in the ventilator circuit, around the tracheostomy and coming out of the patient's mouth.  The patient's caregiver is in the room and states "Don't worry about all those secretions.  The patient does that when he wants attention."     The fact of the scenario is:

Your patient needs more nutrition than she is currently taking in.  The physician has ordered that a feeding tube be placed and tube formula started. The total dose is 1875ml of tube feeds split over three times a day. The formula comes to the floor in 8 ounce cans.  How many cans of the formula should be ordered from the dietary department each day?

Cecilia recently learned that she has necrotizing fasciitis in her duodenum meaning that she had severe tissue death in the duodenum that could not be reversed. As a result, a surgery to the remove the duodenum was performed. In the procedure, the stomach was reattached to the jejunum instead. With this removal, Cecilia is able to survive. Which of the following would need to be done to make sure that she retains fairly normal digestive function: Select all that apply.

Having a good support system is very helpful when going to college.
Skill E2. (This problem is based on a real-world scenario described by Stacey and Cheng, 2016).  A construction firm must decide whether to accept an offer to build an iron ore mine.  If they don't accept the offer, they earn nothing.  If they accept the offer, they'll be paid $5.6 billion if the mine is completed is on-time.  If it is delayed, the payment will decrease by $60 million per month.  If they accept the offer, they will spend $4 billion to build the mine; plus, they have to choose a contractor to build the processing plant; two contractors have submitted bids: AB and FG.  AB will build the plant for $1.5 billion.  FG will build the plant for $1.1 billion.  The construction firm estimates that the chance that AB will fail is only 0.05, but the chance that FG will fail is 0.60.  (Here, "fail" means failing to build a plant that meets requirements by the deadline.)  If either contractor fails, then the construction firm will get back half of the money paid to the contractor, but this will delay completion.  They then must spend $1 billion to build the processing plant themselves, hire more workers (which costs $30 million), and endure a delay of five months (which reduces their payment to $5.3 billion).  Thus, there are five possible outcomes:1. Reject the offer: no loss, no gain: $02. Accept the offer, hire AB, AB fails: lose $480 million3. Accept the offer, hire AB, AB succeeds: gain $100 million4. Accept the offer, hire FG, FG fails: lose $280 million5. Accept the offer, hire FG, FG succeeds: gain $500 million Calculate the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) about whether FG will fail.  Enter a numeric answer; for example, if the answer were $1 million, enter 1000000.

The company's income statement for the most recent month is given below:              Sales (7,500 units at $55 per unit)  $412,500    Less manufacturing costs:      Direct materials $70,000     Direct labor (variable) $73,200     Variable factory overhead $14,800     Fixed factory overhead $42,150 $200,150    Gross margin  $212,350    Less selling and other expenses:      Variable selling and other expenses $34,600     Fixed selling and other expenses $54,000 $88,600    Net operating income  $123,750            There are no beginning or ending inventories.            Required:            Calculations must be shown for full credit to be awarded.            a. Compute the company's monthly break-even point in units of product. Round to the next higher whole unit. (Hint: First convert the traditional income statement format to a contribution-approach format.)              b. What would the company's monthly net operating income be if sales increased by 16.0% and there is no change in total fixed expenses?             c. What dollar sales must the company achieve in order to earn a net operating income of $65,600 per month? What is the margin of safety in dollars and as a percentage, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent?              d. The company has decided to automate a portion of its operations. The change will reduce direct labor costs per unit by 45 percent, but it will triple the costs for fixed factory overhead. Compute the new break-even point in units. Round to the next higher whole unit.                2. (12 points) Data concerning Murray Corporation's single product appear below:                Per Unit Percent of Sales     Selling price $250 100.00%     Variable expenses $40 16.00%     Contribution margin $210 84.00%             Fixed expenses are $1,139,400 per month. The company is currently selling 8,900 units per month.             The marketing manager would like to introduce sales commissions as an incentive for the sales staff. The marketing manager has proposed a commission of $18 per unit. In exchange, the sales staff would accept an overall decrease in their salaries of $141,800 per month. The marketing manager predicts that introducing this sales incentive would increase monthly unit sales by 5%.                 Required:            Prepare two contribution format income statements, one based the company's current revenue and expense structure and another based on the marketing manager's proposal. What would be the overall effect on the company's monthly net operating income of this change in (a) dollar increase or decrease and (b) percent increase or decrease? Round the percent to the nearest tenth of one percent. Show your work.

This problem statement applies to questions 44-47:  A sled is pulled to the top of a hill. The sketch above indicates the shape of the hill. At the top of the hill the sled is released from rest and allowed to coast down the hill. At the bottom of the hill the sled has a speed v and a kinetic energy E (the energy due to the sled's motion). Answer the following questions. In every case friction and air resistance are so small they can be ignored. Question 47: For the higher hill that is less steep, how does the kinetic energy of the sled at the bottom of the hill after it has slid down compare to that of the original hill? A. The kinetic energy of the sled at the bottom is greater for the higher but less steep hill.B. The kinetic energy of the sled at the bottom is the same for both hills.C. The kinetic energy at the bottom is greater for the original hill.D. There is not enough information given to say which kinetic energy is greater.J. None of these descriptions is correct.

Write a recursive function called makeDashed that takes a string as a parameter and that returns a new version of that string with all characters in lowercase and with dashes in between them. The table below shows sample calls and the value that should be returned:    Function Call Returned value   makeDashed("cat") "c-a-t"   makeDashed("aAbDC") "a-a-b-b-c"   makeDashed("to BE OR NOT to bE") "t-o- -b-e- -o-r- -n-o-t- -t-o- -b-e"   makeDashed("C++ is fun") "c-+-+- -i-s- -f-u-n"   makeDashed("TO") "t-o"   makeDashed("a") "a"   makeDashed("") ""    Notice that no dashes are printed for strings with less than two characters. You are not allowed to construct any structured objects (no arrays, vectors, strings, streams, etc) and you may not use a while loop, for loop, or any other type of loop to solve this problem; you must use recursion.

While most organisms can safely eat most phytoplankton, some phytoplankton produce toxins. When these toxic algae reach high population levels it is known as a toxic algal bloom. Toxic algae can poison animals that eat them, and in turn, humans that eat these animals. The toxins the algae produce reduces predation and has been selected for. However, if predators feed on toxic prey for many generations, the predator population may evolve resistance to the toxic prey. Copepods, small crustaceans and the most abundant animals in the world, are main consumers of toxic algae. Along the northeast coast of the US, there is a toxic phytoplankton species, Alexandrium fundyense, which produces very toxic blooms. Blooms of Alexandrium occur often in Maine, but are never found in New Jersey. Scientists wondered if populations of copepods that live Maine were better at coping with this toxic prey compared to copepods from New Jersey.        Scientists tested whether copepod populations that have a long history of exposure to toxic Alexandrium are adapted to this toxic prey. To do this, they raised copepods from Maine (long history of exposure to toxic Alexandrium) and New Jersey (no exposure to toxic Alexandrium) in the laboratory. They raised all the copepods under the same conditions. The copepods reproduced and several generations were born in the lab (a copepod generation is only about a month). This experimental design eliminated differences in environmental influences (temperature, salinity, etc.) from where the populations were originally from. The scientists then measured how fast the copepods were able to produce eggs, also called their egg production rate. Egg production rate is an estimate of growth and indicates how well the copepods can perform in their environment. The copepods were given either a diet of toxic Alexandrium or another diet that was non-toxic. If the copepods from Maine produced more eggs while eating Alexandrium, this would be evidence that copepods have adapted to eating the toxic algae. The non-toxic diet was a control to make sure the copepods from Maine and New Jersey produced similar amounts of eggs while eating a good food source. For example, if the copepods from New Jersey always lay fewer eggs, regardless of good or bad food, then the control would show that. Without the control, it would be impossible to tell if a difference in egg production between copepod populations was due to the toxic food or something else. Use this information for the next 3 questions.

Written Question 5 - Part 1 Fill in the spaces below, assuming that Gazorpazorp uses FIFO for process costing (10 points).  What is the cost per equivalent unit with respect to:  Transferred in costs (2 points)                            [a1] Materials costs (2 points)                                     [b1] Conversion costs (2 points)                                 [c1]    What is the dollar value of the total costs assigned to the units:  Completed and transferred out (2 points)        [d1] Ending inventory (2 points)                                [e1]      Note: When entering your solution, use numeric values only (no commas, no dollar signs, no spaces, etc.). For cost per equivalent unit, round your answer to the nearest cent if rounding is needed (e.g., round 3.721 to 3.72). Enter integer values for the costs assigned to ending inventory and completed units.

Listeners can sometimes be bored by statics because we hear and see them so much. One way to ensure your statics are not boring is to translate stats into information that is meaningful to listeners.
When you go outside on a hot summer day, your body temperature heats up above the normal range. Receptors in your brain detect the change in body temperature. The brain activates nerve cells that send messages to sweat glands and blood vessels, causing the body temperature to fall as the sweat evaporates from the skin and vasodilation occurs. What part of this feedback loop is the stimulus?

15     A crane is being used to lift containers off a ship. One container has a mass of 14 000 kg and is being lifted vertically with a speed of 3.2 m s-1.           The electric motor being used to supply the power to lift the container is using a current of 240 A at a potential difference of 2200 V.           What is the efficiency of the system?

In regard to the car wash process, please answer the following 2 questions. (See the previous question and your response below).  Question is worth a total of 5 points. A. A new employee is hired by the car wash to increase system capacity. No other changes can be made to the process. To which workstation would you assign this new worker?  Explain why you would assign them at this station and not at one of the other stations. (Note: This worker cannot be cross-trained so they can only be assigned to one workstation; there will now be two people at the workstation instead of one. ) B. What will the maximum system capacity be if you assign the new employee to the workstation you indicated in the previous question and no other changes are made to the process? Assume that the new employee is just as fast as the current employee doing the same task.  Be sure to show calculations and/ or explain your answer).    Here is your response and earlier question: The following is a process flow diagram of the steps involved in getting your car washed.  There is one worker assigned to each of the five tasks, for a total of 5 workers. Total task time at each of the five stations is provided. (Note: WIP = Work In Process Inventory; FG = Finished Goods; RM = Raw materials or customers).    Please answer the following 5 questions - label each response  A, B, C, D, and E, and include the term in your response to avoid mixing up the responses. A. What is the unconstrained capacity in terms of units per hour for each workstation?   Be sure to include units of measure for your answer (i.e. cars, seconds, cars/ hour, hours/ car, etc.)  and show the calculation used to determine these values.  (Note: Unconstrained capacity is how much can be produced per time period if it is not limited by production of an earlier workstation) Order and pay = Vacuum = Wash = Dry = Inspect = B. Which operation is the bottleneck operation?  Why? C. What is the maximum system capacity in terms of cars completely processed per hour? (Assume that the process has already completed the first unit.)  Explain your answer or show your calculations. D. What is the value of the minimum throughput time? (include units of measure)  Explain your answer or show your calculations. E. What is the value of the system cycle time?  (include units of measure)  Explain your answer or show your calculations.   Your Answer:  A Unconstrained capacity Order and pay = 60mn / 3 mn per car = 20 cars/ minutes Vacuum = 60 mn / 5 min per car = 12 cars / minutes Wash = 60 mn / 15 min per car = 4 cars / minutes Dry = 60 mn / 4 mn per car = 15 cars / minutes Inspect= 60 min / 10 mn per car =  6 cars per minutes   B) Wash is the bottleneck operation because workers spend more time ( 15 minutes) to produce less output ( only 4 cars).  C) System capacity = capacity of the bottleneck = 4 cars / minutes D) Minimum throughput time= task cycle time + WIP time + transportation time   E) System cycle time = time between the completion of each unit of output     O =(5-3)=2  W=15-

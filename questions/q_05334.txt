R = 8.314 J/mol K F = 96, 500 J/V mol Consider the reaction: X2 (g) +  Y2 (g) -  2 XY (g) A) Calculate Kp for this reaction if DG* = -5.49 kJ/mol at 298K.. B) If the partial pressures of the initial mixture are P (XY) = 0.22 atm, P (X2) = 0.35 atm, and P (Y2) = 0.31 atm, calculate DG for the reaction at 298K.  C)  Is the reaction at equilibrium?  If not, in which direction does it need to proceed to reach equilibrium? Place your final answers for A-C here with the appropriate letter.

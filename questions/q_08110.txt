Master Electronics has contracted to purchase 10,000 computer chips from Schneider Electronics for use by Master in manufacturing electronic calculators. On March 1 Schneider delivered the chips to Master. Master's purchasing agent inspected the chips and determined that they were the correct type and that the appropriate quantity had been shipped. Master also tested the performance of 50 of the chips selected on a random basis. The test results were satisfactory (although the tests conducted did not duplicate exactly all of the functions the chip would need to perform when made part of the end-product). Master accepted the chips and paid for them. On March 19, Master determined that Schneider had improperly engineered the chips and that they were, as a result, incapable of performing an important calculating function. This defect did not become apparent to Master until it had incorporated 25 of the chips into calculators as part of the manufacturing process. On March 20, Master contacted Schneider and demanded that Schneider take back the chips and refund the purchase price paid by Master. Which of the following statements is INCORRECT?

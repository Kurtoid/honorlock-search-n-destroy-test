ENGL 1301 Final Exam (25%) Should a COVID-19 Vaccine Be Mandatory? Directions: The prompts below are based on the following three sources. The prompts require you to write an essay using the sources as support for your argument. Be sure to embed quotations and cite them correctly (you don't need to include paragraph or page numbers). Spend about 15 minutes reading the sources and planning your essay. Introduction At this point in the COVID-19 pandemic, both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are being administered to the public. Many people are excited to receive a vaccine and hope that its distribution will help life return to normal. They suggest that making this vaccine mandatory is a necessity to create a safer community and protect those who are vulnerable to the virus. Others are concerned that this vaccine may have severe side effects and have voiced refusals to receive this vaccine even if it is mandatory; they argue that they have the right to refuse to receive this treatment. Read the following articles. Then, choose one of the following prompts below: Choice 1: Cause and Effect Essay Write an essay explaining the possible effects of requiring a mandatory COVID-19 vaccine. Include a clear thesis that explains 2-3 effects, which can be positive and/or negative. Include an introduction, at least 2-3 body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Be sure to embed multiple quotations from the sources (about 2 per body paragraph) and include in-text citations. Write about 500-750 words (the equivalent of 2-3 pages). Include the MLA header at the top, and refer to at least 2 of the sources provided. Choice 2: Position Essay Write an essay arguing for or against a mandatory COVID-19 vaccine. Choose a position; do not merely present the pros and cons of both sides. Include a clear thesis that defends your position and explains 2-3 reasons. Include an introduction, at least 2-3 body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Be sure to embed multiple quotations from the sources (about 2 per body paragraph) and include in-text citations. Write about 500-750 words (the equivalent of 2-3 pages). Include the MLA header at the top, and refer to at least 2 of the sources provided. Notes:  Be sure to avoid going on rants or making this a political issue. Your response should be a well-argued, well-reasoned, and logical discussion of this issue using at least 2 of the sources provided. Do not generalize about "people" or "the government." Avoid making this whole essay a personal example. We all have certainly been affected by this issue, but don't lose sight of the essay's purpose. Be sure to focus on the included sources. Remember to include short quotations (fewer than three lines of text). Be sure to include in-text citations (Last Name of author(s) or 1stword of "Title" if no author), but you do not need to create a Works Cited page. Correct citations:     (Trujillo and Motta).

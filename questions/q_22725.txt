Activity 3 - Using Presentation Software (PS)  (26 minutes)     Karen wants a slide show to encourage members of other fitness clubs to enter the competition. She has produced a TITLE slide (saved as PENTATHLON) using the settings on the master slide. She wants three more slides in the presentation.         These are her original designs for the slides             RIGHT CLICK on the button to open the LAYOUT in a new tab/window                        These files are available:             * images in GRAPHICS.              * information about the competition in TEXT             RIGHT CLICK on the button to open the files needed in a new tab/window.              Open the slide presentation PENTATHLON. RESAVE the document as Act3_SurnameName (e.g. AG3_LootsKarien)         (a)   Edit the master slide to make changes to the settings for the presentation.             (i) The blue background is too dark. Change it to a more suitable shade.   (1)         (ii) Add the logo you created in Task AG2 to the bottom left-hand corner of the master slide.    (1)         (iii) Change the default font to any sans serif font.   (1)         (iv) Enter your name and surname in the center footer area of the master slide. Add the slide number in the right footer area and today's date (Fixed) on the left footer area.   (4)     (b)   Produce THREE other slides using information from the files TEXT and GRAPHICS and the LAYOUT shown in Karen's original design. You do not have to use all the text and graphics. (all files needed on the blue buttons you have to open in a new tab.)             (i) Create slide 2 to describe features of the competition.   (3)         (ii) Create slide 3 to detail prizes and gifts for competitors.   (3)         (iii) Create slide 4 to explain how to:   (3)         * find out more about the competition             * enter the competition.             (iv) Add animation and transitions to your slides   (2)     (c)   Karen wants to encourage more 11- to 14-year-old girls to enter the competition.              (i) Change slide 3 to make it more appealing to this age group   (1)         (ii) Change the presentation so that it runs continuously without user intervention.   (1)         (iii) Add Action Buttons on each of your slides that will link your pages with one another and back to HOME page.   (1)         (iv) On slide 1, add some NOTES for the presenter.  Explain shortly to the presenter what is a pentathlon competition and what events are part of this type of competition. (you may use the internet to get this information)   (2)         (v) Add a hyperlink on the last slide for more information on the topic. Use a more information Action button and link this action button to  https://kids.kiddle.co/Pentathlon         (2)         RESAVE the document as Act3_SurnameName             UPLOAD YOUR DOCUMENT -  Act3_SurnameName             TOTAL FOR ACTIVITY 3   [25]
Which of the following substrates can cross the mitochondrial membrane? (select all that apply)
Follow the instruction below to answer this question: 1. Copy the graph below to your answer sheet.   2. Use your best artistic skill and draw a band diagram for a npn transistor with VEB = 2 V and VBC = 0.5 V. Use the emitter as the electric ground.  Quantify the energy the quasi-Fermi level difference between the emitter and the base, as well as the quasi-Fermi-level difference between the base and the collector.  Your plot should reflect the feature of the quasi-neutral region in each section of the transistor. Random drawing or erroneous QFL assignments will receive zero credit. 3. Identify the biasing mode of this transistor:

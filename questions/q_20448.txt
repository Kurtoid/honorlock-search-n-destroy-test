Please use the following information to answer the question(s) below.The cycads, a mostly tropical phylum of gymnosperms, evolved about 300 million years ago and were dominant forms during the age of the dinosaurs. Though their sperm are flagellated, their ovules are pollinated by beetles. These beetles get nutrition (they eat pollen) and shelter from microsporophylls (leaflike structures that contain microsporangia). Upon visiting megasporophylls (leaflike structures where megaspores are formed), the beetles transfer pollen to the exposed ovules. In cycads, pollen cones and seed cones are borne on different plants. Cycads synthesize neurotoxins, especially in the seeds, that are effective against most animals, including humans.If the beetles survive by consuming cycad pollen, then whether the beetles should be considered mutualists with, or parasites of, the cycads depends upon

Diatoms are encased in cases (valves) made of translucent hydrated silica whose thickness can vary. The material used to store excess calories can also vary. At certain times, diatoms store excess calories in the form of the liquid polysaccharide laminarin and at other times as oil. The table shows data concerning the density (specific gravity) of various components of diatoms and of their environment.    Using dead diatoms to "pump" CO2 to the seafloor is feasible only if dead diatoms sink quickly. Consequently, application of mineral fertilizers, such as iron, should be most effective at times when diatom valves

A 22 yo male presents complaining of shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing. He has no past medical history. He thinks he caught a cold because all his friends have the same symptoms. He takes no medications. You listen to his lungs and he has wheezing. His vital signs are normal. His chest X-ray is normal. You order spirometry and the results are as follow: FVC: 5 L (98% predicted), FEV1: 4L (80 % of predicted), and FEV1/FVC ratio 65%. After administering a short acting bronchodilator to the patient, spirometry is repeated and the results are as follows: FVC: 5.1 L (99% of predicted) and FEV1 4.1 L (81% of predicted). What is the most likely diagnosis?

In the Himalayas, Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, reaches over 8,800 meters at its peak. At this altitude the atmospheric pressure is only 254 mm Hg.

Bar-headed goose hemoglobin can bind the same number of oxygen molecules as human hemoglobin, but their affinities for binding oxygen are different (see graph below).       What is the approximate oxygen saturation percentage of bar-headed goose hemoglobin on top of Mount Everest?

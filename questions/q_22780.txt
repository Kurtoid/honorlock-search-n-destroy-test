Which of the following neurotransmitters affects neurons involved in voluntary movement, learning, memory, pleasure and reward, and possibly responses to novelty?
What type of species is described in both of the following passages? Environmental Scientists are often able to monitor the status and health of an entire ecosystem simply by monitoring the status and health of (?) present in that ecosystem. This is possible because environmental problems show up quickly in species that are very sensitive to environmental change and, so, once a problem is detected early in the sensitive species, scientists can identify the problem rapidly and fix it before it begins to affect the rest of the ecosystem and the less sensitive species living there.   Ecologists are often able to identify and classify a particular community in the environment just by identifying or detecting a single (?) within it.  This is because some species are only found in certain communities, never outside of them, so if we spot such a species, then we can know instantly the name of the community or ecosystem we're looking at. The passages above reveal the two different ways scientists use the term, (?).

An electronics manufacturer produces three models of mp3 players, model A, model B, and model C.  The company knows how much assembly and testing time is needed for each model.  Model A requires 0.4 hours of assembly and 0.2 hours being tested.  Model B requires 0.5 hours of assembly and 0.3 hours being tested.  Model C requires 0.8 hours of assembly and 0.6 hours being tested.  The company decides it should produce three times as many model B players as model C players.  If the company has allocated 600 hours for assembly, and 370 hours for testing, how many of each model should the company produce if it wants to use all the time allocated for each phase of the process? (A)  Define variables. [ans7a] (B)  Report system of equations. [ans7b1][ans7b2][ans7b3] (C)  Solve your system. (Show in your written work.)

An advantage of using ROI to evaluate performance is that it encourages the manager to reduce the investment in operating assets as well as increase net operating income.
A nurse reviews the medication list of a patient with a 20-year history of diabetes mellitus. The patient holds up the bottle of prescribed duloxetine (Cymbalta) and states, "My cousin has depression and is taking this drug. Do you think I'm depressed?" How would the nurse respond?

Patient is a 56 year old female with a diagnosis of BPPV.  She reports acute vertigo with vomiting during positional changes.  The patient is afraid to move and walks with a very stiff gait.  The patient is asked to assume a long sitting position with the head turned to the left side.  The therapist then quickly moves the patient backward so that the head is extended over the end of the table approximately 30 degrees below the horizontal.  This maneuver causes severe dizziness and vertigo.  A repeat test with the head turned to the right produces no symptoms.  The physical therapist reports these findings as a   _________________________   .
A airplane that is flying level needs to accelerate from a speed of 2.00 x 102 m/s to a speed of 2.40 x 102 m/s while it flies a distance of 1.20 km. What must be the acceleration of the plane?
The process of storing glucose as glycogen is known as:
Step 1.  Let a = rho * SQRT(  a1 * a2 ) with a1 and a2 being the shape parameters and b1 and b2  being the scale parameters   Step 2.  X1 = Random.Gamma( a1-a, 1 ) Step 3.  X2 = Random.Gamma( a2-a, 1 ) Step 4.  X3 = Random.Gamma( a, 1 ) Step 5.  Let Y1 = b1 (X1 + X3 ) and Y2 = b2 (X2 + X3 ). 5.  The purpose of this problem is for you to demonstrate that you can use the above algorithm to generate two correlated random variates.  Let U be a random variate with a gamma distribution having a shape parameter of 4 and a scale parameter of 10.  Let V have a gamma distribution with shape parameter of 4 and with the expected value of V being 20.  Finally, let the correlation coefficient between U and V by 0.8. a.  Using Excel, generate the necessary number of random numbers needed to produce the two correlated random variates U and V.  Round those numbers to three digits to the right of the decimal and list those random numbers here. [rn] b.  Using those rounded values for your random numbers, generate U and V, and list your two random variates here. [rv] Note that I will use your rounded values to generate U and V myself to verify your work so make sure you use the rounded values and not the  full random numbers generated by Excel with all their digits.  You might want to show your work in the final problem to receive any partial credit for your work in case your numerical values are wrong.

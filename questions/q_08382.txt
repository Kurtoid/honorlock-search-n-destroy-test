Choose ONE of the Following Questions  Choose ONE of the following questions to answer (#3 OR #4). Please indicate the number of the question that you are answering. If you answer BOTH questions, only the first response will be graded regardless if the second answer is more correct.  3.  Describe the baroreceptor reflex that occurs when blood pressure increases (short term neural mechanism).  Include all components of the reflex arc and all effects sent out by the control center, including a reasoning behind each component (why the component changed as it did). OR 4.  You are picnicking on a beautiful grassy knoll when Big Boy (the hungry alligator) suddenly appears next to you.  Your blood pressure suddenly and drastically increases.  Answer all of the components of this question (A - C).  What ANS division has kicked in? What happened to blood vessel diameter to invoke the increase in blood pressure? How does this then affect end systolic volume, venous return, stroke volume, end diastolic volume, and peripheral resistance?  Please use complete sentences and include the reasoning behind your response. Note: This is asking how these factors are directly affected by an increase in blood pressure, NOT how the body will compensate.  You can either answer this in paragraph form or using bullet points by each term; complete sentences, with reasoning, MUST be included regardless as to how your format your response.  The answer must also be written in a sequential way, as if telling a story, using the terms in correct sequence.  Hint: The terms are NOT listed in the sequential way in which they must be used, as if telling a story about the physiological response from seeing Big Boy and his ginormous teeth.

In the past twenty years, health-care costs in the United States have skyrocketed. The result is that a large number of people--particularly the poor and those in the lower middle class--cannot afford health care. There are many reasons for this rapid increase in health-care costs. One cause of the price increase is the aging of the U.S. population. Greater numbers of older Americans have created an increased demand for medical care, leading to higher prices. Another reason that health-care costs are so high is that medical care is better. As a result, patients who once died quickly from conditions such as comas and strokes can now live much longer--but need expensive medical care that often goes on for years. Soaring costs have been caused as well by the way in which health care is used in the United States. American medicine tends to focus on treating a disease, not preventing it. Therefore, simple steps that could prevent illness and save money--such things as prenatal care and free exams for the elderly--are often ignored. When people finally get to a doctor, they are more likely to have advanced problems that cost more money to treat. The main pattern of organization in the selection is:

An experiment investigated whether cell phone use changes drivers' reaction times.  College students were randomly allocated to a cell phone group or a control group.  The experiment measures subjects' response times (in milliseconds) in a driving simulation.  Data were collected for both groups and the 95% confidence interval estimate was calculated to be (8.1, 70.7).  Which of the following statements is correct?

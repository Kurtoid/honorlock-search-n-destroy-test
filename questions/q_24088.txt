Question One (One Hour and a Half)               The state of Jefferson, relying on data gathered by federal government agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has banned the sale or distribution of cigarettes that are flavored with menthol (which provides a more pleasant, mint-like flavor).  The legislature and governor were persuaded to adopt the ban because of CDC data demonstrating that a majority of current smokers who began smoking as minors or young adults began by smoking menthols.  (***Assume that it is commonly accepted that smoking is extremely hazardous to human health.)                 Jefferson health leaders and legislative leaders are also at least as concerned about the CDC findings that 93% of Black adults who smoke began as menthol smokers.  This preference for menthols continues into adulthood--nearly 77% of Black smokers prefer menthols compared to only 35% of Latino smokers and 25% of whites.  The leaders are convinced that menthol-flavored cigarettes are a "gateway drug" to an often fatal smoking habit.  They think it is particularly offensive that, in addition to preying on the young, the tobacco companies are exploiting the nation's Black communities, who are disproportionately poor and already inundated with serious health problems.  Several leaders of Jefferson's Black community, particularly those who work in the health field, are pleased that the legislature is taking serious action against menthols, which they argue will help the Black community above all.               But many Black leaders in the civil rights community have the opposite opinion.  They think the purpose of the law is to help whites convince themselves of their own virtue (and save tax dollars on health care) at the expense of Black people.  They point out, aside from the obvious fact that the law will deny people, who are disproportionately Black, a product that they want, that criminalizing the sale of the popular product will only lead to the creation of illegal markets in Black communities already suffering from the predations and violence of criminal organizations that fund themselves by selling illegal drugs.  These markets, which will inevitably draw in otherwise innocent customers and struggling entrepreneurs trying to scratch our a living by selling loose cigarettes, will potentially lead to increased tense confrontations with the police which, in the past, have led to violence and even death.  The law's opponents argue that, instead of taking a punitive approach, the state could invest more in providing better and more useful services, including health care and education.               The residents of these communities have also raised their voices and asserted their rights.  James Wright, a Black resident of Jackson, is outraged that the government is going to use force to take away something---the smoking of menthol cigarettes--that helps ease the pain of a hard life and gives him one of the few pleasures he can reliably enjoy.  He understands the risks of smoking, and remembers his parents smoked every day, and lived well into their 80's.  He thinks that the state is hostile to both Black people and those who won't play by their rules.  He will sue.             The only good thing about this tobacco controversy is that it momentarily provided state policymakers a needed break from thinking about how to deal with the coronavirus.  With the arrival of the vaccines, lawmakers thought they were close to the end, especially because Jefferson residents have been unusually aggressive about being vaccinated, racking up one of the nation's 5 highest vaccination rates. But the great response by Jefferson citizens and the pause put on the distribution of at least one of the vaccines because of health issues has caused a problem--there is now a shortage of the vaccines.  The state must make choices about who will get it.               After a long debate about who are truly the stakeholders in their political community--those people who are fully engaged and participate in the life of the state--the legislature and governor decided that vaccines supplied by any state government entity should only be given to those who are U.S. citizens (this provision thus excludes non-citizens who are here legally, e.g. visa and "green card" holders).  The lawmakers believe citizens of other nations should look to their native countries for their share of the vaccine.  The lawmakers have also decided that, to be eligible to receive a vaccine, a person must prove they have resided in the state for at least 6 months. The state wants to be sure that people who get the vaccine intend to remain in the state permanently--they don't want it going to truly temporary residents.             Finally and most significantly, the lawmakers, for the time being (they can always, of course, amend the law later) have decided to restrict the vaccine only to those people have not tested positive for the coronavirus.  The state reasons those who contracted the virus have already developed natural immunity for at least a few months.  After those who did not contract the virus are fully vaccinated (which should take approximately 6 months), the state can consider opening up the vaccine to those who tested positive for the disease.             The state's restrictions have angered many.  A class action has been formed to challenge the three laws.  The plaintiffs consist of non-citizens who are legal residents, new state residents who have been in Jefferson fewer than 6 months (who are willing to legally swear they intend to reside here permanently) who think it is dangerous for them to have to wait 6 months to get the vaccine, and, finally, a group of those who tested positive for the virus at the beginning of the pandemic, who are deeply concerned that any natural immunity have since worn off (the current estimate is that immunity lasts about 3 months, but it is possible that it lasts longer) and that the state has unnecessarily put them at risk.  The claimants have an important ally in their member of Congress, Representative Susan Birch.  She believes that the legislature is oblivious to the Constitution and has filed a bill that will prevent any state or local government from denying the coronavirus to: (1) non-citizens who are legal residents; (2) state residents, who are present and intend to remain, on the basis of their period of residency; and (3) to those who have tested positive for the virus.  The governor and legislature think this law is unconstitutional.             Meanwhile, as the vaccines work and the virus recedes, Jackson businesses and their customers are chafing on the restrictions on their activities.  The city of Monticello has retained a mandate that people must wear masks in all indoor public accommodations (shops, restaurants, etc.), with an exemption for people who are actively eating or drinking.  While it could, if it so wished, send in inspectors to police patron behavior at the restaurants, the city officials, in order to be less heavy handed and provocative, rely on the establishments themselves to enforce the city ordinance.  City officials, for example, expect restaurant employees to ask unmasked patrons who are walking around the place or using the restroom to please put their masks on.               Most establishments have complied with the law, but a few have not.  They believe that the minute one walks into a restaurant that anything you do there, including chatting with your friends at another table or going to the bathroom, is part of eating or drinking.  One of these dissenters, Gus's Bar and Grill, has gone so far as to run ads on radio and online telling their customers that as soon as they come in, they can take off their mask and relax--no one will bother them no matter what they do in the restaurant.  The City Council is livid that any establishment would undermine the mask mandate and advertise their disrespect to boot and passed an ordinance forbidding any restaurants from placing any advertisements in any medium, including print, radio, television, and the Internet, declaring their refusal to ask residents who are not actively eating or drinking to wear their masks.  Gus has hired a lawyer and will sue.             You are a law clerk to the federal judge who has been assigned all of these cases.  Write a memorandum discussing all the legal issues raised by Wright's challenge against the menthol cigarettes law; the class action regarding the three vaccination provisions; and the challenge to the city ordinance.  Your judge also is interested in the constitutional issues regarding the proposed congressional statute.  Make sure to fully explain the arguments for both sustaining and striking down the alleged government actions regarding all of these issues.

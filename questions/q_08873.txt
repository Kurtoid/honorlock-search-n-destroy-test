Rebelo Corporation is presently making part E07 that is used in one of its products. A total of 17,000 units of this part are produced and used every year. The company's Accounting Department reports the following costs of producing the part at this level of activity:         Per Unit         Direct materials   $   3.80     Direct labor   $   3.80     Variable manufacturing overhead   $   1.10     Supervisor's salary   $   2.50     Depreciation of special equipment   $   1.40     Allocated general overhead   $   8.60           An outside supplier has offered to make and sell the part to the company for $20.80 each.

You can use MATLAB either through UF Apps or if you have student license downloaded version of it. Here is the link for UF Apps: https://info.apps.ufl.edu/ For a given phrase, write a program which swaps the first letters of the words in such a way that the first letter of the first word is swapped with the first letter of the last word. The first letter of the second word is swapped with the first letter of the second last word. Similarly, the first letter of the third word is swapped with the first letter of the third last word and so on.

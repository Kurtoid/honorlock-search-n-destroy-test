The GBBO Company has a total of $7 of cost per carton broken down as follows (DM = $2, DL = $3, MOH = $2).  The MOH amount of $2 includes a provision for normal spoilage and rework.

The spoiled cartons cannot be sold to Universal Studios and are instead sold immediately for cash to other customers for $2.50 per carton.

Coal gasification can be represented by the equation: 2 C(s) + 2 H2O(g) - CH4(g) + CO2(g)             DH = ?   Use the following information to find DH for the reaction above. CO(g) + H2(g) - C(s) + H2O(g)                      DH = -131 kJ CO(g) + H2O(g) - CO2(g) + H2(g)                 DH = -41 kJ CO(g) + 3 H2(g) - CH4(g) + H2O(g)               DH = -206 kJ

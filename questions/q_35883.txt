Using information from the following document and your own knowledge, answer the following questions.     In this 1883 speech, Frederick Douglas challenged black Americans to have "sufficient spirit and wisdom to organize and combine to defend themselves from outrage, discrimination, and oppression," and not to depend on the Republican party.            "Though we have had war, reconstruction, and abolition as a nation, we still linger in the shadow of an extinct institution.  Though the colored man is no longer subject to be bought and sold, he is surrounded by an adverse sentiment which fetters all his movements.  In his downward course he meets no resistance, but his course upward is resented and resisted at every step of his progress. . . .  The color line meets him everywhere, and in a measure shuts him out from all respectable and profitable trades and callings. . . .           If liberty, with us, is yet but a name, our citizenship is but a sham, and our suffrage thus far only a cruel mockery, we may yet congratulate ourselves upon the fact that the laws and institutions of the country are sound just, and liberal.  There is hope for a people when their laws are righteous, whether for the moment they conform to their requirements or not.  But until this nation shall make its practice accord with its Constitution and its righteous laws, it will not do to reproach the colored people of this country. . . .  ~~Frederick Douglas, Speech of September 24, 1883       Douglas says ". . . we still linger in the shadow and blight of an extinct institution."

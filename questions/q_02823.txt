Zip Inc. manufactures electric generators. Zip is considering whether to continue to make the motors it uses in its generators or to buy motors from an outside supplier. At the budgeted level of annual production, Zip's per-unit costs of manufacturing motors in-house is as follows:   Zip will avoid 30% of its fixed manufacturing overhead costs if it buys the motors from an outside supplier. In addition, producing the motors in-house requires 4 hours of machine time, which is a constrained resource. If Zip buys the motors, this machine time would be freed up to produce more units of another product that requires 8 hours of machine time and has a contribution margin of $90 per unit. At what per-unit purchase price will Zip just break-even on buying the motors from an outside supplier rather than making the motors in-house?

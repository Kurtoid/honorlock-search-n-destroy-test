Problem 5 Zarra Clothing Co is world-renowned for its "fast-fashion" business model, according to which different clothing designs are produced only once, at small quantities, and are sold over a short period of time ranging from one to two months, before they are replaced by a completely different design. As Zarra's newest production manager, you are trying to gain an understanding of the profits associated with the production plan put in place by your predecessor. According to this plan, the production quantity for each design is 400 units (for simplicity, you can assume there is only one size), and each design is sold over two months. Each unit costs $9 to produce. In the first month, each unit is sold for $15, while in the second month, the price is decreased to $12. At the end of the second month, any units that remain unsold are sold to discount stores for $4 (this is viewed as the "salvage" price). Demand in the two months following the introduction of a new design is highly uncertain. In the first month, demand is estimated to be Normally distributed with a mean of 200 and a standard deviation of 40. In the second month, demand is estimated to be Normally distributed with a mean of 300 and a standard deviation of 60. You decide to conduct a simulation analysis using the following template.

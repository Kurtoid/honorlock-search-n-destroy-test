Dr. Disney has been raising exotic fruit flies for decades. Recently, he discovered a strain of fruit flies that in the recessive condition have blue eyes that he designates as "b". He also has another strain of fruit flies that in the recessive condition have pink wings that are designated as "p". He is able to establish flies that are homozygous for both mutant traits with blue eyes and pink wings. Dr. Disney then takes phenotypically wild-type dihybrid females (b+ b p+ p) and mates them with double recessive males (b b p p) in a dihybrid testcross. In the resulting progeny, he observes 500 flies that are of the following make-up:  What is the recombination frequency between the gene for eye color and the gene for wing color?

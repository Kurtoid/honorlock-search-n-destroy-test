An amino acid can never exist as an uncharged compound, regardless of the pH of the solution. To be uncharged, an amino acid would have to lose a proton from an +NH3 group with a pKa of about 9 before it would lose a proton from a COOH group with a pKa of about 2. Therefore, at physiological pH (7.4), an amino acid exists as a dipolar ion, called a zwitterion. With another acidic or basic functional group, there may be more ions.            Choose the accurate zwitterion form of the amino acid above as it exists at physiological pH (7.4).

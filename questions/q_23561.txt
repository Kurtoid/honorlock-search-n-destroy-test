Florida International University PH.D. IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS PROGRAM  Comprehensive Examination Spring2021 Morning Session (8 AM - 12 PM)   Answer the first question and any ONE of the other three questions. You need to address all parts of each question to which you are responding. The answer to each question should be 5-7 pages (typed and double-spaced). You are expected to provide coherent and thoughtful responses.   Question 1 (You must answer this question): In his essay on administration, in addition to arguing for the politics-administration dichotomy, Woodrow Wilson makes three other important points. These include the need to engage in the comparative study of public administration across national boundaries, the need for a merit based civil service system, and that public administration, certainly in the United States, must be built upon a foundation of democratic government. Please develop an essay in which you address two of Wilson's four points, both in terms of how subsequent public administration theorists have approached these matters and what relevant empirical studies and historical experience have indicated regarding the wisdom of Wilson's perspectives on these matters.   Question 2: Private and public sector leadership and administration emphasize a different, and at times, competing, set of values. Discuss what these values are. Identify the work of at least three public administration theorists and discuss how each theoretical perspective has attempted to advance one or more of these values. Explain how one or more of these values are evidenced in the governmental response to the global pandemic.   Question 3: The last year has tested government agencies' ability to pivot operations, mobilize their workforces, and address urgent public needs when resources are strained. How can we use the ideas from organizational behavior and theory to understand why some agencies have handled these challenges well and why others struggle? Be sure to discuss at least three different theories or perspectives.   Question 4: An important debate in public administration is how much discretion should be allowed to public administrators and how elected officials can control/monitor bureaucrats. Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of administrative discretion by drawing on a particular public service to illustrate your arguments. What research evidence is there that public administrators have used their discretion to enhance the equity of outcomes at the individual, organizational, or community levels? What challenges remain?

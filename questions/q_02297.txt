PROBLEM A Use this scenario to answer this question and the next few questions. Scenario Lola Chiko: Although her product is illegal, Lola Chiko operates her drug enterprise according to the sound business practices she learned in Econ 1110. She has two sets of customers, experimenters and addicts, and she has no competitors for this particular nasty drug. The demand schedules for each customer market per day are listed below. Her marginal cost per dose is $9.99 (you may round this to $10 in your calculations). Her fixed costs are $1000 per day for the car with dark windows, the cellular phone, life insurance, and bribes. Assume that she makes her customers pay in ten-dollar bills to reduce her carrying costs, and will not give change. The table below summarizes the demand faced by Lola.      Experimenters Addicts Combined   Price Doses Revenue MR Doses Revenue MR Doses Revenue MR   $80 0   ////// 10    //////       //////    70 4     12             60 8     14             50 12     16             40 16     18              Please copy and paste below, then complete the table with Revenue (Rev) and Marginal Revenue (MR). Note: Alternatively you may use a scratch paper to complete the table and then upload a scan/picture of it on the last questions of the test.

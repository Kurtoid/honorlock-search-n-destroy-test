In 2050, a space station on Mars consumes 100 toothpaste tubes per Martian year (which is 687 Earth days, or 669 Martian days) and keeps a safety stock of 60 tubes. Cargo ships with supplies are flown from Earth to Mars every half of the Martian year. Considering the period between launches as the only component of the order lead time, what is the reorder point for toothpaste tubes in whole units? Tips: 1.

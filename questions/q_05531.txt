Identify one assigned author from any of the three time periods we've studied whose ideas about social problems, civic engagement, and/or societal reform you believe are still relevant today. Do not choose an author you wrote about for Essay 1 or Essay 2; and do not write about Boland, Duffy, Heaney, or Thomas, who are too contemporary for this prompt. You may discuss multiple texts by the author you've chosen, or you may focus on just one text. To make this decision, consider the depth and complexity of the texts; for example, The Idea of a University would be sufficient by itself, but "The World Is Too Much with Us" would not. Write a literary argument that thoughtfully and thoroughly answers these three questions:  How do the author's texts engage with a specific societal issue of his or her time period? How does the author demonstrate, describe, or define social responsibility within his or her historical context? How are the themes/arguments in the author's texts--specifically those themes related to the author's engagement with social responsibility--still relevant to readers today?  In addition to answering the above questions, your essay should follow these guidelines:  Write an argument. Analyze the literature; don't just summarize it. Develop your body paragraphs; don't get bogged down in the introduction or conclusion. Use any logical organization for your paragraphs that effectively articulates your ideas. Provide textual evidence to support your claims. Cite all quotations and paraphrases with in-text citations in correct MLA style. However, for this essay, you do not need a Works Cited page. If desired, you may use the anthology's editorial material (e.g., glossing or introductory information) as supporting evidence. Provide signal phrases and in-text citations for this information. All other secondary source material is expressly prohibited. No Googling! Write 600 to 800 words. That being said, don't waste test time obsessing about word count; if you answer the questions thoroughly, you'll be fine. Because of time constraints, you are not expected to produce a fully-revised formal essay. The quality of writing expected is similar to a really good discussion forum post.  I look forward to reading your insights about how the old literature we've studied this semester still matters today! (Or, at least, how one person's writing does.)

Question 16 - Carbocations can be stabilized (lower energy) by increasing the degree of substitution. More substituted carbocations benefit from increased electron donation through the inductive effect and hyperconjugation. First, in box A write a short and concise essay that uses the inductive to explain why tertiary carbocations are lower in energy than secondary. Second, in box B draw a diagram that illustrates hyperconjugation in an ethyl carbocation. Hint: Hyperconjugation can be described as the overlap of the bonding molecular orbital of adjacent C-H bonds with the empty p-orbital of the carbocation.

The registrar selects, using a method which is independent and random, a group of n=150 high school students. This group is randomly divided in two, n1 =75 students are sent to be trained to increase their test scores and n2 =75 students are shown an inspirational movie to act as a control group.               After training both groups are administered an old PDQ. test, the following results are obtained Sample mean 1=257 and Sample Mean 2=249.Any changes due to training represent a change in the location of the mean rather the shape of the distribution, hence s1 = s2= 50   Compute a 95% confidence interval for u1-u2, the difference in mean PDQ. scores for trained and untrained populations.

There are around 1 billion people on this planet who are undernourished or hungry and more than 1.5 billion people who are overweight and obese. Various slow but dramatic shifts such as climate change, soil degradation, pest outbreaks, economic and political crises, and population growth add increasing pressure to the global food system.  The word "resilience" has its foundations in ecology, but in recent times, the term has been used to understand social-ecological systems.  Therefore, we define a resilient food system as the capacity over time of a food system and its units at multiple levels, to provide sufficient, appropriate and accessible food to all, in the face of various and even unforeseen disturbances.  Given what you have learned in this class, how can we make our food system more resilient?  This is a complex issue, and so there is going to be more than one solution; therefore, I do expect you to think about this issue holistically (150-250 words).

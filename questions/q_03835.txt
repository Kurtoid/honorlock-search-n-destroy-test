Mary receives 2 mg of butorphanol and is resting on her left side with a peanut ball placed between her legs and a pillow at her back for support and comfort.  Thirty minutes after she receives the butorphanol, Mary reports feeling an urge to have a bowel movement.  A vaginal exam reveals a cervix that is 9 cms-100%-0 station with a bulging bag of water.  EFM reveals a Category 2 strip with baseline 140, minimal variability, and early decelerations.  The nurse notifies the provider to come to the bedside and the bag of water is artificially ruptured for a moderate amount of clear fluid. Mary's nurse gives a brief SBAR report to the transitional/baby nurse.  List the three most important details to give to the baby nurse that will enable her to care appropriately for the neonate including your rationales.  Use no more than one to two brief sentences for each.  Example:   1.  Bubbles.  Rationale:  they are fun. 2. More bubbles.  Rationale:  they are more fun. 3.  Most bubbles.  Rationale:  they are most fun.

A farmer making grape juice fills a glass bottle to the brim and caps it tightly. The juice expands more than the glass when it warms up, in such a way that the volume increases by 0.3% (that is, DV/V0=3x10-3) relative to the space available. Calculate the force exerted by the juice per square centimeter if its bulk modulus is 1.8x109N/m2, assuming the bottle does not break. Show in detail how you get to the solution of the problem.

Write a program whose input is four integers and whose output is the four integers swapped in pairs (example below). Place the values in an array (name it whatever you want). Your program must define the following method:  swapValues(int[] values) Swap the variables in pairs meaning that the first 2 values should swap positions and the next 2 values should swap positions So if the input is: 3 2 5 4 then the output is: 2 3 4 5 That means that 3 and 2 are swapped and 5 and 4 are swapped. Enter your program in the essay box that follows the below skeleton program  (the full program is fine). Below is a "starter" skeleton to help get you started. import java.util.Scanner;public class LabProgram { // Define the swapValues method here public static void main(String[] args) { // Supply the required statements here }}

Questions 11 to 20 refer to the following case: Miss J is 17 years old. She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) 5 years ago and has been prescribed insulin as a basal-bolus regimen to help achieve glycaemic control (insulin glargine 18 units once daily at evening time; insulin lispro 1-5 units at meal times according to carbohydrate intake). She has struggled with the perceived stigma of diabetes and objects to having to inject herself on multiple occasions each day. This has made achieving a good level adherence difficult.

By March 12, 75 individuals with vomiting and/or diarrhea had been reported to the Texas Department of Health (TDH). All were students who lived on the local university campus. No cases were identified among university faculty or staff or from the local community. Except for one case, the dates of illness onset were between March 9-12 (Figure 1). The median age of cases was 19 years (range: 18-22 years), 69% were freshmen, and 62% were female.   Figure 1. Onset of gastroenteritis among students, University X, Texas. March 1998. (N=72) (Date of onset was not known for three ill students.)      The TDH met with the Student Health Center physician and nurse, and several university administrators including the Provost. County health department staff participated in the meeting. TDHs Infirmary and Health Department staff gathered the following information: The university is located in a small Texas town with a population of 27,354. For the spring semester, the university had an enrollment of approximately 12,000 students; 2,386 students live on campus at one of the 36 residential halls scattered across the 200+ acres of the main campus. About 75% of the students are Texas residents. The university uses municipal water and sewage services. There have been no breaks or work on water or sewage lines in the past year. There has been no recent road work or digging around campus. The campus dining service includes two cafeterias managed by the same company and about half a dozen fast-food establishments; about 2,000 students belong to the university meal plan which is limited to persons living on campus. Most on-campus students dine at the main cafeteria which serves hot entrees, as well as items from the grill, deli bar, and salad bar. A second smaller cafeteria on campus offers menu selections with a per-item cost and is also accessible to meal plan members. In contrast to the main cafeteria, the smaller cafeteria tends to be used by students who live off-campus as well as university staff. The smaller cafeteria also offers hot entrees, grilled foods, and a salad bar, but has no deli bar. Spring break is to begin on March 13 at which time all dining services will cease until March 23. Although many students will leave town during the break, it is anticipated that about a quarter of those living on campus will remain. Hypothesis-generating interviews were undertaken with seven of the earliest cases reported by the emergency rooms and the Student Health Center; all of the cases had an onset of illness on March 10. Four were male and three were female; all but one was a freshman. Two students were psychology majors; the other two were majoring in English and animal husbandry, respectively. Three students were undecided about their major. The students were from five different residential halls and all reported eating most of their meals at the university's main cafeteria. During the past week, all but one student had eaten food from the deli bar; two had eaten food from the salad bar, and three from the grill. Seven-day food histories revealed no particular food item that was common to all or most of the students. Except for the psychology majors, none of the other students shared any classes; only one student had a roommate with a similar illness. Five students belonged to a sorority or a fraternity. Three students had attended an all-school mixer on March 6, the Friday before the outbreak began; two students went to an all-night science fiction film festival at one of the dorms on March 7. Students reported attendance at no other special events; most had been studying for midterm exams for most of the weekend. Using the information available to you at this point, state your leading hypothesis(es) on the mode of transmission.

Your manager, Vikram, has recently been less reliable than he used to be. Over the last two weeks, he failed to show up for an important meeting you had asked him to be a part of. He said he'd give you a project that he then assigned to someone else on the team without alerting you to the decision. He said he was going to email you an important document that would help you prepare for an essential meeting and he never did. He hasn't acknowledged any of these incidents. He has developed a pattern of breaking commitments to you. You meet with him to address your concerns and he asks you, "What are your concerns?"

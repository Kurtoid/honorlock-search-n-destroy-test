Suppose f(x,y)=x2y3-x3y+17{"version":"1.1","math":"f(x,y)=x2y3-x3y+17"} and g(x,y,z)=exyzsin(3x+4y){"version":"1.1","math":"g(x,y,z)=exyzsin(3x+4y)"} a) Find the partial derivative of f with respect to x at the point (2,3). b) Suppose you are standing on the surface z=x2y3-x3y+17{"version":"1.1","math":"z=x2y3-x3y+17"}  at the point (x,y)=(2,3) and you take a small step in the positive x-direction. Does your elevation (or z-coordinate) increase, decrease, or stay the same? c) Find [?]g[?]y{"version":"1.1","math":"[?]g[?]y"}.

The prewriting below is an example of Feb. 3. Yesterday at work a man brought a wallet to the counter. He'd found it on the ground and wanted to return it to its owner. It was filled with $20 bills--I don't know how many, but it was a lot of money. I found a driver's license and called the person who had dropped the wallet. When he came in to pick it up, he said everything was there. Credit cards, money--nothing was missing. It made me think about honesty and wonder how many people who found such a wallet would turn it in, as the man who found it did, and how many people would take the money. Feb. 4. I just read a Time magazine article about Bono, the leader singer of the Irish rock band U2. I really admire him because he's not only talented but also works hard on charitable causes. He is especially interested in helping the people of Africa. Most rock stars are selfish and self-centered, but he's making it cool to care.
Membrane osmometry (MO) is a useful technique for measuring molecular weight (MW) of polymers.   (i) Is it a relative or absolute method for the MW measurement?                      (2 pts) (ii) What specific molecular weight can OM measure?                                    (2 pts) (iii) A plot of p/(cRT) vs. concentration for a polymer sample in three different solvents (A, B, and C) is shown below. Which solvent is a poor, th, and good solvent for this hypothetical polymer? Moreover, calculate the molecular weight of this polymer.    (5 pts)                                                                                                             (iv) Write down one distinct advantage of capitalizing on membrane osmometry (MO) in measuring molecular weight over gel permeation chromatography (GPC).

For this quiz, the following information is provided, click the icon next to the link to Preview the document during the quiz:  Conversions and Constants to Memorize Periodic Table  Formatting instructions for answers typed into quiz textboxes:  If subscripts or superscripts are needed, use the subscript, T2 or superscript, T2 buttons.  If the wrong one is displayed in the menu bar, click the down arrow next to it to choose the other one. Click on the button to turn it on, then click on it again to turn it off.   For numbers in scientific notation, you can use E or the superscript button, T2.  So, either 1.5E9 or 1.5x109. If you need to make a textbox larger, grab and drag the dotted triangle just outside the bottom right corner.

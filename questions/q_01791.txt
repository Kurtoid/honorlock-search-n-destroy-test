Reaction time (RT) is broken down into two components (pre-motor and motor). The pre-motor period involves perceptual and cognitive processing of the response for the task to be performed (e.g. rapid aiming task), and the motor period involves the response itself (e.g. EMG activation until observable movement). When studies were performed that looked at factors that could potentially influence RT such as complexity, time and speed of the task, which RT period was found to be most affected (increased time) by these factors?

Case Study (100 points) Please answer questions concisely and write clearly. The following questions are based on the case study: Case 19-2018. The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 378: pp. 2421-9, 2018. Laboratory data and all equations below. Case Study Synopsis:   A 15-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital during the summer because of acute kidney injury. The patient had been well until 8 days before admission, when painful cramping in the lower abdomen and bloody diarrhea developed. Bowel movements occurred approximately every hour, and the patient was unable to sleep. On the third day of illness, two episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis (vomiting) occurred.  The following day, the patient was seen by her primary care pediatrician, with symptoms of fatigue, persistent diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and vomiting had persisted. She appeared pale and had an elevated heart rate (98 bpm), and temperature was 36.5degC, but otherwise the results of a physical examination were normal.  Stool samples were negative for pathological bacteria and infectious pathogen toxins. The patient was advised to take loperamide (to halt diarrhea), acetaminophen (Tylenol), and ranitidine (stomach acid reducer), and to drink an electrolyte-containing oral rehydration solution.   During the next 3 days, the diarrhea resolved, but the patient continued to vomit and have abdominal cramping, with oliguria (abnormally low urine output) developing. The patient was taken to the emergency department at a local hospital for further evaluation and treatment.  A medical history revealed that she was on citalopram for depression and had occasional urinary tract infections and trouble urinating. A week prior to the current episode, she was at a festival with her family and had eaten street vendor food that made her stomach mildly upset.  After extensive tests, it was determined that the patient suffered from an underlying genetic disease of the blood cells, which caused acute kidney injury.  The disease was likely accelerated by an infectious bout of food poisoning.  Following treatment to stimulate proper blood cell and platelet function and hemodialysis, the patient improved.  She will most likely need to receive the medication for the rest of her life, but her prognosis is good.

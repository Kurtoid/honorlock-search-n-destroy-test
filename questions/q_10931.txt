Question 8: A 40-year old chemist working at a Swiss pharmaceutical company described the following two experiences: "Last Friday, April 16, 1943, I was forced to stop my work in the laboratory in the middle of the afternoon and to go home, as I was seized by a peculiar restlessness associated with a sensation of mild dizziness. On arriving home, I lay down and sank into a kind of drunkenness, which was not unpleasant and which was characterized by extreme activity of imagination.

Occasionally I felt as if I were out of my body." The doctor who examined him in both instances found pupillary dilation, tachycardia, sweating, blurred vision, tremors and incoordination. The author had:

This passage will appear in Questions 16 and 17. Bearded dragons are popular reptiles in the pet trade and demonstrate multiple mutations in pattern, scale type, and color. Most bearded dragons express normal coloration in shades of gray or brown, which is a dominant trait. However, many breeders try to produce dragons that express a recessive mutation called "zero," where the dragons are silver. Use "N" to represent the dominant allele for normal coloration and "n" to represent the recessive allele for the zero mutation. These alleles follow the inheritance pattern for complete dominance. Which genotype will result in a bearded dragon with the zero mutation?

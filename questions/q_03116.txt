A new method for making concrete has been proposed. To test whether the new method has increased the compressive strength, five sample blocks are made by each method.  The compressive strengths in pounds per square inch are as follows:    New Method 148 142 138 145 140   Standard Method 139 136 143 133 141      Does this indicate that the new method has increased the compressive strength, at the 5% significance level? We will use a nonparametric test to answer this question.   For reference, here is the data is sorted order (S=standard, N=New)    Method S S N S N S N S N N   N-Value 133 136 138 139 140 141 142 143 145 148   Rank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

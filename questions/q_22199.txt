Wimbledon Shoes (WS) WS is a private limited company that manufactures tennis shoes. It uses labour intensive production methods in its two factories. WS is a family owned and operated company. WS has been trading for twenty years. It has grown significantly over the last ten years, almost doubling production during that period. The family has recently rejected an offer to sell the business to a large multinational shoe manufacturer. WS produces and sells tennis shoes that are sold in both business markets and consumer markets. WS is facing significant challenges. Pauline , the Managing Director, has been examining the following information.     Summary data for WS         2018   2019   2020     Revenue   $1.92   $1.56   X     Average Price (per pair of shoes)   $16   $12   $10     Average Cost (per pair of shoes)   $6   $4   $3     Production (Pairs of shoes)   120 K   130 K   140 K     Finished goods inventory at end of year (pairs of shoes)   0   0   20 K     Labour productivity (pairs of shoes per worker )   4 K   3,7K   3,5K                           Pauline knows that WS is not competitive as unit costs are too high. Labour turnover has been rising. Training is not as effective as it should be. Most competitors use capital intensive production methods. Pauline is considering a proposal that could help secure the long term future of WS. This would be to enter into a joint venture to open a new factory to manufacture shoes. This will require investment in capital equipment costing $5m. There will be redundancies in the existing factory

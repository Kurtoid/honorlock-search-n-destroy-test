Required:  The following transactions occurred in the General Fund of Pallet Town in 20X2.   Use the Canvas table function (use the formatting below as a guide) to prepare the necessary journal entry(ies) required in the General Fund for each item below.  The total estimated revenue budget for 20X2 is $11,000,000 and the total appropriations are $9,500,000.  Total planned transfer to debt service funds is $800,000. Property taxes of $7,000,000 were levied for Pallet Town.  Assume that 2.5% of the total property taxes levied are estimated to be uncollectible due to local economic conditions. Pallet Town was able to get a tax anticipation note that was secured by the Town's power to tax.  The Town borrowed $500,000 and planned to repay the loan as tax collections begin to exceed current disbursements for the year. The Town issues a purchase order for $40,000 to Pokemart, Inc. for supplies. Pallet Town received a $980,000 advance funded grant from the federal government to provide for general government activities. The Town collected property taxes of $6,500,000. The Town repays the principal tax anticipation note above plus $12,600 in interest. Pokemart, Inc. delivered the supplies order by the Town and bills the Town for $42,000.  The Town accepts delivery and prepares a voucher for the full amount of the bill.  The Town uses the purchases method to account for supplies inventory. Based on tax assessment appeals, the Town reduces taxes for several taxpayers by a total of $125,000.  These taxpayers had already paid $25,000 of this amount prior to winning the appeals. Upon examining the revenues and expenditures to date, the Town's governing board decided to amend the budget.  The revenue budget needs to be increased by $85,000 and the appropriations should be increased by $65,000. Pallet Town incurred and paid $430,000 of qualifying expenditures using the funds received from the advance funded grant above. The Town's General Fund receives a bill from the Town's Water Utility Fund for $6,000 for water used by the City.  This amount will not be paid until next year. At year end, the Town declares all unpaid property taxes (and the associated allowance account) to be delinquent.  Interest and penalties of $5,000 (and an associated allowance of 10%) are assessed against delinquent taxpayers and is considered available. A year-end review of the Property Tax Receivable subsidiary ledger indicates the following:  $225,000 would be received within 30 days after year-end $110,000 would be received between 30 and 60 days after year-end $45,000 would be received between 60 and 90 days after year-end $20,000 would be received between 90 and 120 days after year-end   The Town's employees earned salaries of $450,000 during 20X2, with $400,000 paid in cash.  The remaining amount was earned during the last week of December 20X2 and will be paid during the first week of January 20X3. The Town files a tax lien against one of its delinquent taxpayers.  The taxpayer is past due on $40,000 of property taxes and owes penalties and interest of $4,000 on delinquent taxes.  Be sure to label each entry using the lettering above (A-P).

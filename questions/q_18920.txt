For each of the following sentences provide a logical representation in First-Order Logic. Use the following predicates to describe the sentences: food(x): x is a food              vegetable(x): x is a vegetablestew(x): x is a stew              contains (x, y): x contains y meat(x): x is meat                mineral(x): x is a mineralbeef_stew(x): x is a beef stew carrots are vegetables: [cav] vegetables are food: [vaf] vegetables contain water: [vcw] some vegetables contain the mineral iron: [vcm] a beef_stew is a stew that contains beef: [stew] Use forall(x) to describe the universal quantifier, exists(x) to describe the existential quantifier, and, or, not, implies, equivalent to describe logic [?], [?], !, =, and =. For example, [?]x (p(x) [?] q(x) = r(x) should be written as forall(x) (p(x) and q(x) implies r(x)). Hint, only use the predicates listed above. Chose constants for everything else.

Using the following information, deduce the sequence of the original octapeptide.  Write the original peptide sequence in order using one-letter codes for the amino acid in the appropriate blanks.  A list of peptide cleavage reagents and their specificities are shown below. 1.  Total acid hydrolysis:  Arg, Glu, Gly (2.0 equivalents), Lys, Ser (2.0 equivalents), Thr 2.  Trypsin:  2 products.  Each was isolated and hydrolyzed with acid and their amino acid compositions were determined:  #1 (Lys, Ser (2.0 equivalents)); #2 (Arg, Glu, Gly (2.0 equivalents), Thr) 3.  Staphylococcus aureus V8:  2 products.  Each was isolated and hydrolyzed with acid and their amino acid compositions were determined:  #1 (Arg, Gly (2.0 equivalents)); #2 (Glu, Lys, Ser (2.0 equivalents), Thr)   [amino_acid_1]-[amino_acid_2]-[amino_acid_3]-[amino_acid_4]-[amino_acid_5]-[amino_acid_6]-[amino_acid_7]-[amino_acid_8]   Reagents for peptide cleavage ArgC:  Cleaves after Arg AspN:  Cleaves before Asp Carboxypeptidase:  Liberates the C-terminal amino acid as long as this residue is not Pro.  If the C-terminal residue is Pro, there is no reaction Chymotrypsin:  Cleaves after Leu, Phe, Trp, Tyr CNBr:  Cleaves after Met LysC:  Cleaves after Lys Staphylococcus aureus V8:  Cleaves after Asp, Glu Thermolysin:  Cleaves before most hydrophobic residues Trypsin:  Cleaves after Lys, Arg

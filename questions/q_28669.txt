Select ONE of the following questions. Be sure to answer each part of the selected question and be sure to be specific in your answers--leave no room for vagueness, as this may be interpreted as a lack of understanding and could result in a failing score.   Option 1: Applying Concepts to Research Design You have been tasked with developing a research proposal evaluating the relationship between social class and educational outcomes in the state of Missouri. Thinking about this relationship, you should consider the best methodological approach (qualitative or quantitative methods); a measurable research question; how you may gather your sample and how to ensure the protection of your research subjects. For each point below, explain in detail (utilizing material gained in the course) how you would approach this project, addressing the following questions: -1. Which methodological approach (qualitative or quantitative) would you select and why? How might the project differ if you were to select the alternative methodology? -2. What is your research question? How will your selection of methods seek to answer this question? -3. What potential errors may arise in your research and how can you attempt to control for these errors? Be specific using the terminology provided in coursework. -4. What type(s) of sampling strategies would you use? Explain your reasoning for the use of the strategy. Again, be specific and show your knowledge. -5. Discuss in detail how you would uphold research ethics in the form of protection of subjects, using the ethical issues discussed in the course.   Option 2: Theory and Methods As we have learned, the standpoint of the researcher can influence how a researcher may approach their study. Considering the research proposal below, discuss how Critical Social Science (CSS), Positivist Social Science (PSS) and Interpretive Social Science (ISS) would differ, be careful to illustrate your understanding for each approach in the following research proposal: Proposal: Evaluate the relationship between social class and educational outcomes in Missouri: For this question: -1. Detail how the guiding questions would differ among the three approaches for the proposed study. -2. Describe the methodologies that would be utilized by each approach. -3. Explain how each approach would influence the direction and findings of the following proposed study.   Option 3: General Methods -1 Compare and contrast qualitative and quantitative methods, what are the benefits and drawbacks of each? -2. What are potential errors that can arise in Qualitative Methods? What strategies can researchers utilize to avoid these errors? -3. What are potential errors that can arise in Quantitative Methods? What strategies can researchers utilize to avoid these errors?  Finally, how might utilizing a mixed methods approach be a benefit to researchers when confronting issues of validity and reliability? Be very careful to explain the concepts of validity and reliability, in the discussion of mixed methodology.

My company did well last year, so we're OK financially now. We only had to pay 5 percent in interest on that loan. We depend on support from the government for funding. I want to invest my money only in companies that help people. She thinks the city shouldn't help the homeless, but I believe otherwise. The house that we own is our only real asset. The transfer of homeless people from crowded shelters to attractive apartments went smoothly. The company had to reconsider its projects after it lost all of that money. We're still trying to figure out the best way to help the homeless.

Define a new type called ClockTime that can be used for storing an amount of time in hours and minutes (both whole numbers). It should also include data about whether the time is AM or PM. The user should be able to construct a ClockTime representing 10:30 AM by writing: ClockTime amount = {10, 30, true}. Write a function called time_after that takes a pointer to a ClockTime and two ints as parameters and returns a pointer to a new ClockTime containing the time it will be if the number of hours (value stored in the first int parameter) and the number of minutes (value stored in the second int parameter) are added to the time in the passed in ClockTime. You can assume the passed in ClockTime will contain a valid time on a 12 hour clock (hours 1 - 12, minutes 0 - 59). Your returned ClockTime should also contain a valid time on a 12 hour clock. You can assume the passed in int representing minutes will be between 0 and 59 and the passed in int representing hours will be between 0 and 24. The passed in hours and minutes summed together will be no more than 24 hours. ClockTime start = {10, 25, true}; ClockTime* end = time_until(&start, 2, 20);  After the above call the variable end should store 12:45 PM ({12, 45, false}). ClockTime start = {10, 25, true}; ClockTime* end = time_until(&start, 10, 45);  After the above call the variable end should store 9:10 PM ({9, 10, false}). ClockTime start = {10, 25, true}; ClockTime* end = time_until(&start, 22, 45);  After the above call the variable end should store 9:10 AM ({9, 10, true}). You may not alter the passed in ClockTime. Remember that 12 PM comes after 11 AM and 12 AM comes after 11 PM.

Bao and Ryu studied the enzyme pyruvate kinase as a possible non-toxic way to synthesize dATP and dGTP for use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), thereby avoiding the currently-used synthetic route that involves EPA-listed toxic reagents (Bao, J.; Ryu, D.D.Y. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2005, 89, 485-491).  The reaction is shown below.  The authors proposed that this enzyme follows a random kinetic mechanism.  What would be a correct depiction of this pattern in Cleland notation? Mark all of the correct answers, if more than one.  Note that pyruvate is abbreviated as "Pyr" in the diagrams.

For each of the following, only the best answer will count as the correct answer. Q7.  Barry Bogin argued that the _______stage is found only in humans. It is a stage characterized by small body size, slow body growth, rapid brain growth, limited chewing ability, and a short digestive tract (reflecting a need for nutrient-dense, easily digestible foods).   This stage ends with the eruption of the first adult molar tooth.  Q8. Barry Bogin has advanced the idea that the _____ stage of other primates is matched by the infancy plus childhood stage of humans. Great apes nurse their infants 4-7 years and space their infants 5-8 years apart.  They have slow life history which makes them vulnerable to extinction.  Human infants are weaned by 3 years of age (or younger) and this allows human mothers to reproduce much sooner than great apes.  Each human female can produce more offspring (even though it takes those offspring longer to grow up). Q9. The beginning of the ________stage is marked by the eruption of the first adult molar tooth while the end is marked by the beginning of reproductive maturity and the eruption of the second adult molar. Body growth is steady but slow and here is not much brain growth.  This stage is found in all primates. Q10. As described in the article by Barry Bogin, there is research evidence that infantile head proportions evoke a _______ response in human adults. Q11. Gosso studied Parakana children and reviewed the ethnographic record of children living in other forager societies (a.k.a. hunter-gatherer societies). She observed that the life of forager children is mostly a life of _______.  She concludes that the "human pattern" (the one shaped by 300,000 years of our species history) "involves allocating a very large part of the day to ______ing."   [Note that the same term is used in both blanks]. Q12. Overhand ________is a human-specific forelimb activity whose mature form is not mastered until a child is 6-8 years of age. Q13. _________is a locomotor gait of human children which is rarely seen in adult humans and is not found in any other animal. Thus, this kind of locomotion is both species-specific and stage-specific.  In Children of Heaven, this gait was used by Roya while returning home at the end of the school day. Q14. Robert Fagen found that among vertebrates, only birds and _______play. These are also the parental care classes (in which immature members of the species have the protection of parents). Fish, amphibia and reptiles do not play nor do invertebrates (except, perhaps, octopi).  Q15. A characteristic which makes it possible to distinguish "play" behavior from behavior that is "not play" is the fact that play involves metacommunication signals used only in a play context. These signals convey the message "this is play."  Among humans, the vocalization known as ________ communicates this message during play.

A hospital division consists of two large nursing units, A and B. The registered nurses (RN's) in units A and B earn $26 and $24 per hour, respectively. Overtime is paid at time-and-a-half. There is also the possibility of assigning some of the hours from nurses assigned to unit A to meet requirements in unit A. The division wants to develop a 6-month staffing plan. The minimum number of labor hours required in each unit each month are:     January February March April May June   Unit A 2700 2300 2100 2600 3100 3300   Unit B 2400 2800 2900 2600 2400 2300    The number of regular-time hours allocated for any individual unit should be the same in each of the 6 months (i.e., regular-time hours in unit A might be more or less than unit B, however the number of regular-time hours assigned for A in January must be the same number in A for Feb, March, etc.). Overtime can be used as needed in any unit, but cannot exceed 18% of regular-time hours in any month. In any given month, up to 15% of the total number of regular-time plus overtime hours available from nurses assigned to unit A can be used to meet nursing requirements in unit B. Develop a linear programming formulation that will determine the assignment of regular-time and overtime nursing hours to each nursing unit each month. The objective of the model is to minimize total staffing costs for the division during the 6-month period. Constraints of the model should guarantee that nursing hours meet or exceed the labor hours required in each unit each month, and that the overtime and substitution (i.e., using hours assigned to A to meet requirements in B) conditions are satisfied.

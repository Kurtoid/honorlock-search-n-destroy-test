If you answer more than two questions, only the first two will be graded. (5 pts. each) 1) Describe how eutrophication works.  Specifically, how an increase in nutrients can ultimately result in little to no dissolved oxygen in that water and what the environmental and potential economic effects are from eutrophication. 2) Describe what acid deposition is, how acid deposition can form, and how people in neighboring areas can be affected by acid deposition even though they might not be associated with the initial causes of acid rain formation. 3) Discuss the differences between primary and secondary pollutants and how a reduction of primary pollutants could result in a decrease in secondary pollutants.  Provide one real-world scenario where a reduction in a primary pollutant could reduce a secondary pollutant. 4) Discuss what a thermal inversion is, how they relate to increased temporary pollution, and why it is important to know an areas susceptibility to thermal inversions when it comes time for city planning. 5) What is the difference between unconfined and confined aquifers?  Why can artesian wells only occur in confined aquifers? 6) Humans can alter the flow of water to suit are many "needs" or "wants".

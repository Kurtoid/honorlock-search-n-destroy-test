Outcome           1        2        3        4        5       6 Frequency        62     45      63      32      47     51   Do these data indicate that the die is unfair ? Use a 1% level of significance.                              How do you calculate expected frequencies for cells in a contingency table in a test of independence ? How are the degrees of freedom calculated ?                       Samples of US Congress members were taken. One sample was Democratic and the other Republican. The number of dollars spent on federal projects in each congressperson's home district was recorded.

Pearson's correlation coefficient, r, takes values in what range ? If the x and y labels on the variables are switched when calculating r, is it true or false that the value of r will change ?               Consider the following data on study time (x) and subsequent test score ( y).  x  20     15  12  10    7    4 y  100   85  75  72   64  40 Calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient for this data.

Calculate and interpret the coefficient of determination for the data and regression from question 5.                       a) For the regression in question 5, find the predicted test score for a       student who studies for 12 hours             b) Is the calculation in a) an example of interpolation or extrapolation ?       Why ?              For the regression line in question 6, interpret the slope and y intercept of the line.                     In a study of 1228 medical malpractice lawsuits, 856 of them were dropped or dismissed. Use a 0.01 level of significance to test the claim that more than half of malpractice lawsuits are dismissed.                                    A sample of 25 workers with employer provided health insurance paid an average premium of $6600 with a sample standard deviation of $800. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean premium amount paid by all workers who have employer provided health insurance.                             Interpret the confidence level in question 11.                                   Assume that IQ scores are normally distributed with mean 100 and standard deviation 15 points. If 100 people are randomly chosen, what is the probability that the sample mean will be between 98 and 104 points ?                             It is known that about 64% of people who are murdered knew the person who murdered them.  .  ( p = 0.64 ). 63 unsolved murder cases are examined. Use the normal approximation to the binomial distributionto find the probability that at least 35 of the victims knew their murderers.                             A company allows free returns of it's products within one week after purchase. An average of 2 out of 10 products sold are returned within one week. Using the Poisson distribution, find the probability that exactly 7 out of 40 products sold on a given day will be returned within one week.                           In a village in Hawaii, about 80% of the residents are of Hawaiian ancestry. Let n be the number people you meet until you encounter the 1st person of Hawaiian ancestry in the village. Write a formula for the probability distribution of the random variable n. Compute the probability that n=4.                     In January in Hawaii, 60% of the days have surf at least 6 feet. At the start of the month, you pick 7 days randomly for vacation. What is the probability that at least 5 of your 7 vacation days have surf at least 6 feet ?

Athletes expect that the athletic trainer will educate them about their injury and what to anticipate during the rehabilitation and return-to-play process. This educational discussion often includes a return-to-play timeline, which is difficult to discuss because of many unknowns. Unknowns may include rehabilitation setbacks or changes in pain tolerance or motivation. When athletes ask when they will return to play, what will you say? How do you plan to go about this discussion?

The removeMinNode method defined for the BinarySearchTree class can be defined as follows:private BTreeNode  removeMinNode( BTreeNode  current)  {    if (current.getLeft() == null)        current = current.getRight();    else        current.setLeft(removeMinNode(current.getLeft()));    return current;}  Explain what is returned by the removeMinNode method the last time it is called recursively.  What is done with the return value when control is returned to the previous level of recursion?  Be sure to label your answers.

You are an engineer tasked with designing a gas power plant using a new fuel with a unit cost of $0.50/kg and heating value of 70 MJ/kg. Due to improvements in combustor technology, the combustor for your plant operates perfectly, with all heat released during combustion being transferred to the working fluid.  For analysis purposes you model your plant's cycle as an ideal air standard Brayton cycle with reversible compressor and turbine.  Assume the only relevant operating cost is the cost of fuel.  The specifications are as follows:   Air enters the compressor at 100 kPa and 300K with a volumetric flow rate of 50m3/s, The turbine inlet temperature is 1600 K. Remember: Mair = 28.97 kg/kmol and Rbar = 8.314 kJ/kmol-K Partially filled tables of property values are available below     Find: A. For compressor pressure ratios of 25 and 100 determine:  Net power developed in KW  The thermal efficiency Back work ratio  B. The investors in the plant are seeking to minimize the fuel cost per MJ produced. To this end:  Which pressure ratio should be chosen? Why? What are the fuel costs per net MJ produced by the cycle for both ratios($/MJ)? (Hint:  How much is Qin costing you?)  C. After consideration, the investors want to instead maximize the work output of the cycle at the given mass flow. Which ratio should you choose?

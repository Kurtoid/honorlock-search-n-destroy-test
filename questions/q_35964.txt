Two objects are moving in the xy-plane. No external forces are acting on the objects. Object A has a mass of 1 kg and has a velocity v-iA{"version":"1.1","math":"v-iA"}  = (2 m/s)i^{"version":"1.1","math":"i^"} + (2 m/s)j^{"version":"1.1","math":"j^"} and object B has a mass of 2 kg and has a velocity v-iB{"version":"1.1","math":"v-iB"} = (-1 m/s)i^{"version":"1.1","math":"i^"} + (5 m/s)j^{"version":"1.1","math":"j^"}. Some time later, object A is seen to have a velocity v-fA{"version":"1.1","math":"v-fA"} = (3 m/s)i^{"version":"1.1","math":"i^"} + (4 m/s)j^{"version":"1.1","math":"j^"}. What is the velocity of object B at that instant?

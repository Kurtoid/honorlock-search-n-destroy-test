Q#49 A common pattern of social grouping found in Old World monkeys is the female-bonded group in which females are born, live their entire lives and die in the same group (while males born into the group will leave to join another group as they reach maturity). All members of this group are in contact with each other every day. In contrast, the common chimpanzees studied by Jane Goodall live in bi-level fission-fusion social groups of related males (with females as the sex that emigrates to a new group when they reach maturity).  Among chimpanzees, daily foraging parties (2-6 individuals) have changing composition but there is a large stable community of members (30-50+ animals) who recognize each other and share a territory.  Recognition of other members of the community is maintained even without the daily contact necessary in Old World monkey groups.

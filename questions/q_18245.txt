You work in a large academic health care facility as a physical therapist supervisor of the inpatient cardiac intensive care units.  An 18 year old patient awaiting a heart transplant recently was treated by a physical therapist on your staff in the PT department.  The patient was not being monitored on telemetry during the physical therapy treatment as telemetry was only available on the cardiac unit and the exercise equipment was in the PT gym area.  The physical therapist providing the treatment instructed the patient to perform walking exercise on the treadmill. The patient indicated that she felt well and voiced that she wanted to continue the walking treatment for a full 30 minutes.  During the treatment the physical therapist monitored the patient's respiratory rate and pulse, noted some elevation in both rates but did not have concerns.  Once the patient completed the treatment exercise, the physical therapist transported the patient back to the CICU and handed off and made report to the nursing staff caring for the patient.  The patient by that time was having labored breathing and was not recovering as expected from the walking exercise.  Despite all attempts from the nursing and medical staff, the patient coded and later died.   Once the event is reported to the State Health Department and The Joint Commission, what must be performed?

In a random sample of 120 batteries produced by a certain method, the sample average lifetime was 135 hours and the sample standard deviation was 12 hours. An engineer claims that using standard statistical methods that mean lifetime is between 132.452 and 137.548 hours but forgot what alpha was.  Assume the data are normally distributed. In order to reverse engineer the interval and figure out alpha we first need to find the "critical value" that was used in the creation of the interval, i.e. a distributional percentile that is used when creating a CI  Hint: We used CI to solve for sample size n, but now we need to solve for alpha in the critical value

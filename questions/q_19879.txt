11.5   The diagram (linked to the button below) shows an outline of part of the Periodic Table.   Right-click on the button to open the image in a new tab.     Which statement about elements X, Y and Z is not correct? A All conduct electricity. B All form coloured compounds. C All are metals. D All react with oxygen.     (1)
Below are the steps in the mechanism of enzyme catalysis of a serine protease. In red-blue is the peptide bond to be cleaved in a polypeptide chain. You will need to identify the correct number(s) on the arrow(s) where the action described by each statement is occurring (the action starts in the picture before the arrow and is finished in the picture after the arrow). If there is more than one correct answer, list all the correct numbers, separated by commas (for example: 3, 5).   Blank #1: oxyanion intermediate starts forming and is then stabilized by the oxyanion hole. Blank #2: acid-base catalysis enables the activation of the serine residue to become a better nucleophile. Blank #3: acid-base catalysis enables the activation of water to become a better nucleophile. Blank #4: rebound of electrons from the oxyanion reforms the carbonyl group, causing the cleavage of the ester bond in the enzyme-substrate complex. Blank #5: rebound of electrons from the oxyanion reforms the carbonyl group, causing the cleavage of the peptide bond in the enzyme-substrate complex. Blank #6: serine acts as a leaving group, and serine's side chain protonates.  Blank #7: the enzyme-substrate complex breaks.  Blank #8: a low barrier hydrogen bond is formed.

Note: You will not do this question here in the test. So once you finish the above questions you will submit your test. There is a separate Assignment in the Tests modules for you to answer this question. It too is due by 11:59 pm on Monday June 14th. I just had a hard time with Honorlock not fussing about you trying to take a photo and upload a file. So once you are done with this part of the test submit it, and then go to Test Modules, and Open the Five Step Method Test 4 Problems and do them on your own papers. Then either scan it or take a photo and submit it to the assignment as a jpeg photo.   Use the Five Step Method to solve the following Genetic Problems: You will need to do this on your own paper and then upload the file into this question: Be sure to show all steps of the Five Step Method to get full points for each questions. You will not get credit it you do not use the Five Step Method: Question 1: Pure breeding red radishes crossed with pure breeding white radishes make pink radishes. Use the Five Step Method to show the cross and expected offspring and genotypic and phenotypic ratios of the following cross: Cross a Red radish with a pink radish: RR X RW- Show all your work for the Five Step Method on the paper you upload Question 2: In summer squash , white fruit color (W) is dominant over yellow (w) fruit color and disk shaped fruit (D) is dominant of sphere shaped fruit (d). Use the Five Step Method to show the cross, expected offspring, and genotypic and phenotypic ratios of the following cross. Cross a true breeding white disk shaped squash with true breeding yellow sphere shaped squash. WWDD X wwdd- Show all your work for the Five Step method on the paper you upload-use the same paper as Question 1
Indirect filing refers to a method for transferring files to inactive storage at predetermined intervals.

Aviary Inc purchases and places in service $950,000 of specialized equipment (7 year MACRS property) and $1,300,000 of software (5 year property) in June of the current year. If Aviary does not claim first year bonus depreciation but does use the Section 179 deduction, calculate the maximum total depreciation deduction available on the assets in the current year.

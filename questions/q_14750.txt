The chemical formula for diethyl ether is (CH3CH2)2O . Calculate the molar mass of diethyl ether. Round your answer to 2  decimal place. (If you wish, you can show math work for possible partial credit.)
(Treat all values given as having 3 significant figures.)  Box m1 = 6 kg having initial velocity v-1i=8 m/s x^+ 0 m/s y^{"version":"1.1","math":"v-1i=8 m/s x^+ 0 m/s y^"} collides with box m2 = 10 kg having initial velocity     v-2i=4 m/s x^+ 6 m/s y^{"version":"1.1","math":"v-2i=4 m/s x^+ 6 m/s y^"} .  After this partially inelastic collision, box m2 has final velocity   v-2f=4 m/s x^+ 0 m/s y^{"version":"1.1","math":"v-2f=4 m/s x^+ 0 m/s y^"}.   How much kinetic energy is lost during the collision?  (Note: you will need for find the final velocity of box 2 first.)

4. Chemotherapy is a medical procedure that's used to kill cancer cells in order to prevent cancer from continuing to grow inside a human being's body. With this is mind, which of the following is *false*?  A. If Max believes that abortion is morally wrong because the fetus is biologically human, then Max must agree to the idea that chemotherapy is morally wrong. B. If Max believes that abortion is morally wrong because the fetus is a living thing, then Max must agree to the idea that chemotherapy is morally wrong.C. If Max believes that abortion is morally wrong only after a fetus become conscious and psychologically aware, then Max is likely to think that there's nothing morally wrong with chemotherapy.  D. If Max believes that abortion is morally wrong because the fetus is a potential person, then Max must agree to the idea that chemotherapy is morally wrong.

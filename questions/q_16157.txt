Problem #4:  A current sheet with surface current   (A/m) exists at y = 0 on the x-z plane (the interface between two magnetic media).  For y > 0,  (A/m) and u = 5uo.  For y < 0, u = 9uo.  The normal component of in the region x < 0 is:
Berns et al. (2005) used fMRI to examine brain activity as Pp agreed and disagreed with members of their group (confederates) when making judgments about mental rotation of figures. The critical trials were those during which confederates uniformly offered incorrect answers. Pp displayed brain activation in which region when they disagreed with the confederates' incorrect answers?

Problem 1 (30 points): Given: Water at 70degF (density r = 62.3 lbm/ft3, dynamic viscosity m = 6.556 x 10-4 lbm/ft[?]s) flows through the system below at a rate of 0.02 ft3/s. The horizontal pipeline is 0.75 in commercial steel pipe with total length of 200 ft. The vertical pipeline is 2 in cast iron pipe with length of 8 ft. The pump is rated at 82% efficiency. Reservoir volumes are large. Required: (30 pts.) Calculate the power that must be supplied to the pump in lbf*ft/s.                      Problem 2 (20 points): Given: Water in a long pipe flows through a reducing elbow that deflects water at a 45 degree angle from the horizontal, discharging a steady flow of 40 kg/s of water to the atmosphere. The diameters of the horizontal pipe and outlet are 12 cm and 5 cm, respectively. The elevation difference between the centers of the horizontal pipe and deflected pipe outlet is 50 cm. Mass of the elbow and water is 70 kg. Flow through the pipe is turbulent and you may assume a momentum flux correction factor of 1.03. You may otherwise neglect frictional effects.      Required:  (3 pts.) Draw a free-body diagram of the elbow, indicating all forces and momentum. (15 pts.) Determine the magnitude of anchoring force needed to hold the elbow in place, in kN. (2 pts.) Compute the line of action of anchoring force in degrees relative to horizontal Bonus (2 points): Assuming the elbow is at sea level, compute the absolute pressure of water entering the elbow control volume, in units of atm.      Problem 3 (29 points): Given: For the following steady 2D flow, in which the k component is aligned with Earth's gravitational field:    Required:  (5 pts.) Prove that the flow is incompressible. Your final answer must include a one-sentence summary of how you have proven the flow is incompressible. (5 pts.) Prove that the flow is irrotational. Your final answer must include a one-sentence summary of how you have proven the flow is irrotational. (5 pts.) Identify any stagnation points within the flow field. (5 pts.) Derive an expression for acceleration as a function of x and y. (9 pts.) Derive an expression for pressure as a function of x and y.      Problem 4 (20 points): Given: The magnitude of drag force (F) a flow enacts on an object submerged within the flow is a function of fluid density (
In commercial real estate financing, it is common to assume each month has 30 days and each year has 360 days (not surprisingly, this method is called 30/360).  Suppose you are offering a commercial real estate loan to a customer with an APR of 9.00% with DAILY compounding of interest.  The loan that requires no money down and MONTHLY payments of $4,000 for five years starting one month from today.  What is the correct interest rate r to use in the annuity formula? [Answers are expressed in decimal form, so if you believe correct answer is 20%, answer below would be 0.200000000]

Most recipients of cholecystectomies have difficulty digesting fatty foods after the procedure. This is due to the lack of emulsification of lipids during the process of digestion, which makes it harder for lipase to access and break down fats. This means that ________ is/are not being efficiently released into the small intestine during digestion.

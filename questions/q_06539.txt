A 24-hour old neonate born at 30 weeks gestation has developed respiratory distress syndrome. The physician has ordered Beractant (Survanta(r)). The dose is 4mL/kg. How much should you administer? The neonate's weight is 3 pounds (Round to the nearest tenth).
Polymer B is generated from Polymer A by carrying out a post-polymerization reaction.  If the functional groups added to A were uniformly distributed to each polymer chain, B would have the same polydispersity as A.  On the other hand, if the functional group reacted with only some of the A molecules, the polydispersity would change.  If the polydispersity of A is 1.22, determine which of these two possibilities has occurred using the following data for Polymer B:    Molecular weight of x-mer Weight fraction of x-mer   65,000 0.30   125,000 0.40   155,000 0.30

Use the following experimental description to answer the dropdown multiple choice questions.             A researcher performs an experiment involving two strains of bacteria.  The donor strain is met+thr+pro+val+strs.  The recipient strain is met-thr-pro-val-strr.  He mixes the strains and takes samples out at 5 min, 10 min, 15 min and 30 min.  He spreads the cells on media containing streptomycin then tests each colony that grows for the ability to produce the amino acids of interest (met,thr, pro, val).  The results are shown below:       time (min)   %  of cells that are...         met+   pro+   val+   thr+     5 min   0   0   0   0     10 min   0   85   0   0     15 min   0   97   98   0     30 min   25   100   100   0       The experiment being conducted is a [1]. From the data you can tell that the thr gene is [2]. The correct order of the genes from the origin of transfer is [3]

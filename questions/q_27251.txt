1) You are interested to study tomato fruit development and factors that influence it. You looked at tomato genetic resource center and picked a tomato mutant with pale green fruit to study. It is an EMS single gene mutation, and you are interested to identify the gene underlying this mutation. Describe the procedure in identifying the gene underlying this mutation. Give the various details/steps involved to score full points (7.5 points). 2) You have identified the gene underlying the mutation to be GREEN. It came to big surprise that the GREEN gene is involved in chloroplast development in fruits. It is a novel discovery because previously this gene has only been reported to be involved in meristem development in plants. Describe at least 3 methods to support your result that you identified the correct gene and that GREEN gene functions in chloroplast development (5 points). 3) There are multiple genes already known to be involved in chloroplast development. How do you determine the relationship between GREEN that you identified to these other candidates? (5 points) 4) In the meantime, you found another tomato fruit mutant that is gain-of-function mutant of GREEN What is the anticipated phenotype of fruits of this dominant gain-of-function mutant?

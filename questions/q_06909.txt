For example, if a host in the private network with address 10.0.0.5:5000 sends a message to 132.239.8.45:80 then the entry in the NAT table would be filled in as below. The next time the router will use 8001 as the port to establish a new connection and so on.  All connections are TCP. Complete the NAT Table for the following events:a) 10.0.0.5:5000 sends a message to 132.239.8.45:80 (already filled in)b) 10.0.0.6:5000 sends a message to 74.125.239.33:80        Private Address Private Port External Address External Port Transport Protocol   a) 10.0.0.5 5000 132.76.29.7 8000 TCP   b) [Privateb] [PrivatePortb] [Externalb] [ExternalPortb] TCP

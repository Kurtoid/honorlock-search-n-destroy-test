Tableau Task 3       (max 12 pts)   Create a new worksheet in your Tableau workbook.  Name it "Pie Chart".   Management wants a visualization that shows how many restaurants are in each chain.   Create a pie chart as follows:  One wedge for each restaurant chain (total 4 wedges). The size of each wedge is set by the number of restaurants in that chain.   Note:  For each restaurant, we have 3 rows of data -- one each for 2017, 2018, and 2019.  So, to get the correct number of restaurants, you'll need to filter the Viz to only display one year of data, then count the rows.   Configure the visualization so that it fills the entire view. The name of each restaurant chain should be displayed on the visualization at all times, not just when you hover over a wedge. Configure the pie chart so that when you hover over a wedge, it tells you how many restaurants are in that chain.  Use this format:   has  restaurants.For example,  "Steak Masters has 297 restaurants."    NOTES:   This task will be graded manually, based on our evaluation of the TWBX file you submit.

The Chinese company contracts with a corporation from the United Kingdom (a non-CISG contracting state) for the sale of lab test kits.  The Chinese company buys the lab test kits and then supplies them to its Austrian subsidiary.  A dispute has arisen and the Chinese company decides to bring an action against the UK supplier in an Austrian court.

Accordingly, the Republic of Austria assumes no obligation to apply this provision when the rules of private international law lead to the application of the law of a Party who has made a declaration excluding application of subparagraph 1(b) of Article 1 of the CISG.

Fluorescence microscopy offers a unique approach to the study of fixed cells because of its sensitivity and specificity. During the last decade, several techniques have been developed that enable the visualization and analysis of even more complex events in fixed and live cells, organelles and sub-organelle components within the biological specimen. These techniques include fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP), and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Describe principles/concepts of FRAP, FLIP, and FISH techniques.   Q8A (3 points): FRAP     Q8B (3 points): FLIP     Q8C (4 points): FISH

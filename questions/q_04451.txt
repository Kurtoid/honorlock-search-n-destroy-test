Write a static method called insert that takes two arrays of integers and an integer index as parameters and that returns a new array that contains the result of inserting the values from the second array into the first array starting at the specified index. For example if the variables list1 and list2 contain the following values:  list1: [7, 2, 8, 9, 4, 13, 7, 1, 9, 10] list2: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Then the call insert(list1, list2, 2) should return a new array that stores:  [7, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 4, 13, 7, 1, 9, 10] | | +---list2---+ Notice that the new array has all of the values from list1 in their original order, but starting at index 2 the new array has the five values from list2. The order of the parameters matters. For example, insert(list2, list1, 3) should produce the following array as its result:  [1, 2, 3, 7, 2, 8, 9, 4, 13, 7, 1, 9, 10, 4, 5] | | +-----------list1------------+ You may assume that the index passed as a parameter is legal (between 0 and the length of the array passed as the first parameter). The method should not construct any extra data structures other than the array to be returned and it should not alter its two array parameters.

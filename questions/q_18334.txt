Question 1 (25 points): Casting  The sand casting process is being used to create a solid block of metal that can either be in the shape of a cube or a cylinder but has the same volume in either shape. For the cylinder, the diameter and height are equal. The mold cavity is being filled by pouring liquid aluminum through a pouring cup that holds molten metal 20 mm high. The cup is connected to a sprue which is 75 mm tall and has a bottom area of cross-section of 40 mm2. Filling of the mold cavity takes 1 minute. The narrowest section in the gating system has a cross-sectional area of 9p mm2. Answer the following questions. Show all work and list any assumptions. Note: Aluminum has a viscosity of u = 0.0015 Ns/m2 and a density of 2.7 g/cm3. The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s2 and the Chvorinov's constant is 100 s/cm2.     (a) What is the volumetric flow rate of metal during pouring in units of cm3/s? (5 pt) (b) Is the flow turbulent at the narrowest section in the gating system? Explain using numbers. (5 pt) (c) What would be the solidification time for the cube? (7 pt) (d) What would be the solidification time for the cylinder? (5 pt) (e) Based on pouring and solidification, which shape should one select? Explain briefly. (3 pt)

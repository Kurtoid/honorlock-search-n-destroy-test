What holiday does the family celebrate while they are staying in the house?
Some students have been told that people remember words that are written in green ink better than red ink. Therefore, I collected data from 2 sections of Psych 202. My 2:30 pm class had a list of words in green ink to memorize. My 4:00 pm class had a list of words in red ink to memorize. After a delay, student recalled as many words as they could. My 2:30 pm class with green ink had a mean of 27.5 words, SS = 720, n = 36. My 4:00 pm class with red ink had a mean of 21.7 words, SS = 610, n = 36.

State the null and alternative hypotheses using the appropriate symbols. (2 pts)c. Identify the critical value that will serve as the decision criterion. (1 pt)d. Compute the appropriate test statistic. Show your work and bold, underline, and italicize your final answer. (4 pts)e. State your decision regarding the null hypothesis. (1 pt)f. If appropriate, compute effect size (include formula!). Otherwise state N/A (2 pts)g. Interpret these results. (Remember: use "plain English" and present the relevant statistics and results in APA format.) (3 pts)

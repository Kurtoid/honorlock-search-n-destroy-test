You are a scientist in a biotech company that produces custom engineered tissues for patients. Your current project is to develop a bone replacement for a 30-year-old patient who lost part of his pelvis through cancer. At the team meeting, you propose using adipose-derived stem cells isolated from the patient for this project in combination with a scaffold made from the synthetic polymer poly-l-lactic acid.   1. To ensure that the fabricated scaffold does not degrade quickly, your team performs standard accelerated hydrolysis studies. What 2 methods will you recommend they use to monitor degradation? (4 points) 2. After the study, your team discovers that the polymer degrades very slowly, and not appropriate for bone engineering. Give 2 recommended changes to the polymer (poly-l-lactic acid) to increase the rate of degradation. (6 points)

In the late 19th century, scientists began to classify bacteria based on phenotypic markers, such as the presence or absence of cilia. The distinction of prokaryotes and eukaryotes was introduced in the 1960s, but it wasn't until 1977 that the Archaea were classified as a group separate from Bacteria. Today's scientists use phenotypes, genotypes, and phylogenic trees to determine relationships between organisms in Bacteria and Archaea. Which of the following best explains why Bacteria and Archaea were not recognized as separate groups until 1977?
Malignant tumor of the syynovial membrane
A dumbbell-shaped object is composed by two equal masses, m, connected by a rod of negligible mass and length r. If I1 is the moment of inertia of this object with respect to an axis passing through the center of the rod and perpendicular to it and I2 is the moment of inertia with respect to an axis passing through one of the masses, it follows that
Which statement about the urinary system is true?
10.1 In project 4, you implemented the following function void writeDirStruct(DirStructType *d, uint8_t index, uint8_t *e); What is the *e parameter in this function?
Elbert is a home owner and wants to sell his property. Several brokers come forward who offer to sell Elbert his home. Specifically, Francis, James, and Kevin are the potential brokers. Elbert has a hard time deciding which broker to choose from, so Elbert decides to list his property with all three brokers. On January 1, 2015, Elbert lists his property with Kevin. On February 3, 2015, Elbert lists his property with Francis. Finally, on February 28, 2015, Elbert lists his property with James.   On March 3, 2015, Francis gets an offer from a potential buyer on the home. On March 15, 2015, Kevin receives an offer on the home. On March 29, 2015, James receives an offer on the home. All three transmit their offers to Elbert, and Elbert decides to go with James's deal.   What type of broker arrangement has Elbert created?

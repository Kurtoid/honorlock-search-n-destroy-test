Engineers are interested in replacing solid-wood building material by less expensive products made from wood flakes.  They collected the following data to examine the relationship between the length (in inches) and the strength (in pound per square inch) of beams made from wood flakes.  The scientists were interested in knowing if the length of the beam affected its strength.  Interpret the scatter plot.       Be sure to include all 4 important features.
white (w), yellow (y), and cut (ct) are recessive X-linked traits. A yellow-bodied, white eyed female with normal wings is crossed with a male whose eyes and body are normal, but whose wings are cut. The F1 females were wt, while the F1 males had yellow bodies and white eyes. These F1 individuals mated and the phenotype of the F2 male progeny were tabulated as follows:         Phenotypes                          Number Observed       +    ct    y                              9       w   +     +                             6       w    ct    y                           90       +     +    +                           95       +     ct    +                        422       w     +     y                        376       +     +      y                            1       w     ct     +                           1   What is the map distances between ct and w?

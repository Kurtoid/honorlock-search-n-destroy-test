JVB Software is concerned that it current selection system for engineers may be resulting in disparate (adverse) impact for female applicants.  As an HRM consultant, you have been asked to determine whether there's evidence of adverse impact based on last year's selection data.  The prior year's selection data indicate that of the 100 male applicants who applied, 80 were hired; comparatively, of the 10 female applicants who applied, 6 were selected.  Based on this, this selection system does NOT show adverse impact.

To prevent timing attacks, Betty has changed her exponentiation implementation such that it always multiplies the result with something - with the message when the exponent's bit is 1, or with the value of 1 (thus not really modifying the result) when the exponent's bit is zero. In this code, exp, ctable[0] and ctable[1], and one are large numbers, each occupying tens of consecutive cache blocks.   // For each bit in the exponentfor(int bit_idx=nbits-1; bit_idx>=0; bit_idx--){   BN_sqr(res,res); // res=res*res;   // Get bit_idx'th bit from large number exp   bool bit= get_bit_at_index(exp,bit_idx);   if(bit)      BN_mul(res,res,ctable[1]); // res=res*msg   else      BN_mul(res,res,ctable[0]); // res=res*1} Your answer should have two paragraphs, one for part A and one for part B below. A. Explain how the updated code prevents timing attacks. B. The code shown above is still vulnerable to Prime+Probe attacks. To prevent Prime+Probe attacks, Betty can add Scatter-Gather mitigation to the code above. The first byte of the first affected large-number value was at address 0x100 in memory both before and after the Scatter-Gather was applied. Each cache block is comprised of 16 Bytes. At what address would the second byte of the first affected large-number value be after Scatter-Gather is applied? Explain your answer.

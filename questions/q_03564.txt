A schematic shown in Figure 5 of a piping system that is used to move water at 20 degC from a lower pond to an upper pond using a pump at a flowrate of Q = 0.1 m3/s. The elevation between the two ponds is 40 m. The diameter of the plastic piping with an inner diameter of D=10 cm with a roughness factor of e = 0 and a net length of l= 300 m. The loss coefficients for the entrance, exit, 90deg elbows, and valve are provided in Figure 5.   Figure 5.   Assuming steadying, incompressible flow, determine the following:  Minor losses in m; major losses using the Moody chart in m; and the required shaft work to overcome losses and elevation changes in kW .

Aspartame is an artificial sweeter that chemically is comprised of two amino acids bound through an amide bond. Conformational analysis of aspartame has provided insight into the biological receptors that allow humans to perceive bitterness and sweetness. Answer the questions below about the various conformers of aspartame.  The conformation of aspartame (through the C1-C2 bond) that provided insight into the receptors responsible for bitterness was that wherein the dihedral angle between the "Ph" group and the "NHAsp" group was 0deg. Which of the Newman structures below represents this conformation? [0deg] The conformation of aspartame (through the C1-C2 bond) that provided insight into the receptors responsible for sweetness was that wherein the dihedral angle between the "Ph" group and the "NHAsp" group was 180deg. Which of the Newman structures below represents this conformation? [180deg] Which Newman structure of aspartame (through the C1-C2 bond) shown below shows the molecule in its lowest energy conformation (assume "NHAsp" is larger than CO2CH3)? [lowestE] Which Newman structure of aspartame (through the C1-C2 bond) shown below shows the molecule in its highest energy conformation (assume "NHAsp" is larger than CO2CH3)? [highestE] What is the relationship between structures C and F below? [relationship]

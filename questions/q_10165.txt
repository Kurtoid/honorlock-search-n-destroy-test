Problem 3 An athlete is using an exercise machine as shown.  The handle where the athlete pulls is attached to a cable that wraps around two pulleys before reaching an 80 lb weight.  At the position shown, where the weight is slowly being lifted, determine the reactions at points E and F.  A, C and F are pinned connections whereas E is a built-in support.          For all components, give scalar values with units involving lbs and ft.  For any component of reaction that does not exist at a given support, enter 0. Ex = [Ex] Ey = [Ey] ME = [M_E] Fx = [Fx] Fy = [Fy] MF = [M_F]

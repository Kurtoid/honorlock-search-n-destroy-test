A turntable has a radius of 0.80 m and a moment of inertia of 2.0 kg * m2 . The turntable is rotating with an angular velocity of 1.5 rad/s about a vertical axis though its center on frictionless bearings. A very small 0.40-kg ball is projected horizontally toward the turntable axis with a velocity of 3.0 m/s. The ball is caught by a very small and very light cup-shaped mechanism on the rim of the turntable (see figure). What is the angular velocity of the turntable just after the ball is caught?

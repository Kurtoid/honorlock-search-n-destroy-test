Theo is trying to decide which of two types of motorcycle to buy. Initially he rates the two types as being pretty much the same. On a scale of 1-100 (with 100 being the best), he rates Motorcycle A as a 75 and Motorcycle B as a 70. He then reads an article that says that Motorcycle A has many mechanical flaws that make it likely to constantly need expensive maintenance. This causes his rating of Motorcycle A to shift dramatically down to a 50. He shows the article to a friend of his who is a motorcycle expert. The friend laughs and says that everything in the article is completely false and that the author of the article is known to hate Motorcycle A. This makes Theo feel a bit better about Motorcycle A.

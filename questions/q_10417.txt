Catch a bee when its legs are heavy with pollen; then it is ready for home.  It is simple enough to catch a bee on a flower: hold a cup or glass above the bee, and when it flies up, cap the cup with a piece of cardboard.  Carry the bee to a nearby open spot--best an elevated one--release it, and watch where it goes. Keep your eyes on it as long as you can see it, and hie youdeg to that last known place.  Wait there until you see another bee; catch it, release it, and watch.  Bee after bee will lead toward the honey tree, until you see the final bee enter the tree.

The baby cried.  She took a knife and cut a strip from her own thigh. She fished with the worm of her own flesh and caught a jackfish; she fed the child and herself.  Of course she saved the fish gut for bait.  She lived alone at the lake, on fish, until spring, when she walked out again and found people. 13.

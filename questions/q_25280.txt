A girl causes a merry-go-round, which is is initially at rest, to start turning by pulling with a force F=110 N while running on the ground at its edge. She pulls either by grabbing a railing at the edge (a distance R=1.80 m from the center) and pulling sideways, or by grabbing a railing closer the the merry-go-round's center (a distance 3R/4 from the center) and pulling at an angle of th=50deg to the radial direction. Assume the merry-go-round is a uniform solid disk with mass M =155 kg. a) What is the magnitude of the torque applied to the merry-go-round by the girl when she pulls on the outer railing? b) What is the magnitude of the torque applied to the merry-go-round by the girl when she pulls on the inner railing? c) What is the angular acceleration of the merry-go-round when the girl pulls on the outer railing? d) What is the final angular velocity of the merry-go-round after the girl pulls on the outer railing for 5.50 s? e) What is the final angular momentum of the merry-go-round after the girl pulls on the outer railing for 5.50 s?

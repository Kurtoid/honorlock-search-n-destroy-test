Circle Plots:  Suppose you needed to generate a Circle Plot for the student grades listed in the chart below.  Calculate the percent each grade represents of the total grades and the degree in which each grade would represent when drawn on the circle.  Round the percent and the degree to one decimal place if necessary.       GRADE   NUMBER   PERCENT     DEGREE          A          6            B         16            C          9            D          5            F          4                   TOTALS             What percent and degree represent the grade of A?   You will not be able to use symbols in your answers.  Therefore, type the word instead of the symbol.  For example:  90 percent, 252 degrees.
NASA is considering four different cities for a new research facility.  The cities are represented by W, X, Y, and Z.  A group of senior managers voted to determine where the facility will be located.                                                                                                                            Number of Ballots     6 4 8 7     1st Z Y Y X   2nd W Z Z Z   3rd X X X W   4th Y W W Y     Calculate the winner using the plurality-with-elimination method. Now suppose that city Y is removed as an option.  Recalculate the results using the plurality-by-elimination method. Does this election violate the independence-of-irrelevant-alternatives criterion?  Why or why not?

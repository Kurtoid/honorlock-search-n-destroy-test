As a young man was leaving his home, two police officers approached him and placed him under arrest for the robbery of a convenience store. As the young man was entering the squad car, he yelled to his girlfriend, "Call my lawyer and tell her what happened; I don't want to sign anything without her." The young man was given Miranda warnings on the way to the police station. Meanwhile, his lawyer called the station and told the desk sergeant that she was on her way and to have the young man call her as soon as he arrived. She told the sergeant not to allow questioning until she arrived, and the sergeant assured her that it would be several hours until the district attorney arrived and no questioning would take place until then. When the young man arrived at the station, the arresting officers immediately put him in an interrogation room and questioned him about a carjacking that had taken place two days ago. They did not inform him of the call from his lawyer, but he agreed to talk as long as he did not have to put anything in writing or sign anything without her okay. He made incriminating statements about the carjacking, and he was eventually indicted for that crime as well. Prior to trial on the convenience store robbery charge, the young man's lawyer moved to suppress the arresting officers' testimony about the young man's statements.

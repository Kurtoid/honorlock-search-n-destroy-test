A researcher designed a study to examine the effects of a biofeedback intervention on migraine frequency. She randomly assigned subjects to either receive biofeedback training in addition to standard care or to receive just standard care. She also wanted to examine if there was an interaction effect between the biofeedback intervention and the age of the patients. So, she also wanted to include in her analysis the age category of the patient (less than 12 years old, 12-17 years old, or 18 years old and above).

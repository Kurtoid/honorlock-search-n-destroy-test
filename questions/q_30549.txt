In the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), fragments of DNA are incubated with a protein of interest or protein extract containing many proteins and then analyzed on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide or agarose gel. The DNA used in the experiment is visualized either by staining with a dye or by covalently attaching a radioactive phosphate group at one end. Free DNA fragments migrate more quickly through the gel than DNA bound by protein.  Thus, a shift in migration of DNA from fast to slow in the presence of protein indicates a direct binding interaction between a protein(s) and DNA. You are interested in determining which of four proteins, A, B, C, and D, may compete with cAMP-CRP for binding to the lac operon CRP-binding site using EMSA.  You mix radiolabeled DNA fragments containing the CRP-binding site sequence with each of the four proteins and perform nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.  The results are shown in Figure 1.      Question I)   Which protein(s), A, B, C, and/or D, appear to bind to the CRP-binding site? [one] Question II) Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the band pattern seen in lane 6? [two]

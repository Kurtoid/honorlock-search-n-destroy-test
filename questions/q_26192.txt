You are interested in developing a prosthetic touch/tactile sensor and have been conducting experiments to better understand how these behave in biological systems. You've collected some data and are now ready to model and predict the function of some of these sensory organs. You conduct an experiment where you deliver rectangular pressure pulses with a simple actuator onto a patch of skin while recording from a nerve below is the actuator pressure, the spike train you record from 10 trials, and the mean spike frequency from 50 trials recordings. Choose one of the transfer functions below that best describes this sensory organ. Indicate how you would label this transfer function (axes labels with units and appropriate ranges), key point(s) on the transfer function, and where any measurements you use are derived from the experimental data plots.

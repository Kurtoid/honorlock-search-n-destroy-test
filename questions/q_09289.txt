Describe the first three stages of aerobic respiration based on the finger skit: Glycolysis happens in the [a] (part of the cell) and starts with the sugar [b], which contains [c] (give number) carbons.  This molecule breaks into 2 molecules of [d], which contains [e] (give number) carbons and then enters the [f] (part of the cell). Glycolysis produces [g] (give number) ATP (net) per glucose.  Is NADH produced in glycolysis?   [h]  Then one of the carbons is lost as [i].  How is this molecule gotten rid of?  [j]  The group left is called a [k] group.  Is NADH produced in this step?  [l]  This group enters the [m] cycle, where carbons are lost one at a time as [n].  How are they gotten rid of?  [o]  Per glucose, this cycle must happen [p] (give number) times and therefore produces [q] (give number) ATP.  Is NADH produced during this step?  [r]

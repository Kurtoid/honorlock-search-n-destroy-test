12.  Case 1: Read the case below. Explain how the three elements of the fraud triangle were present in this case.  I expect identification of the three elements and their application in this case.  Be sure to explain thoroughly for credit. The case of "Judy" is an important study in the application of the Fraud Triangle and several other fraud examination tenets. As you read the case study, think about each category and how it might apply in this case. Judy had been a bank teller for a regional financial institution for 14 years -- since her senior year in high school. Over time, she became a respected authority in her area, and bank managers and employees saw her as a good person. Her value increased when the bank promoted her to a supervisory position when she was 30.  Though she was finding success in her job, her husband was spending too much time at his work, and she turned to gambling to ease her loneliness. She soon got into significant debt, but she didn't tell her husband. She also didn't tell her family or seek mental health or financial counseling. Instead, (surprise) Judy chose to steal money from bank customers. Judy had a problem of physical and emotional isolation -- a secret to hide from everyone. She felt inhibited to talk through her situation with anybody and work on solutions. Judy targeted elderly customers -- 13 of whom were between the ages of 79 and 99 at the times of the thefts. In one year, Judy made 40 financial transactions without authorization and stole $178,710.89 from 12 different certificate of deposit (CD) bank accounts, which affected 18 customers. However, a forensic audit of her books showed that because she knew the intricacies of the banking system, Judy was actually able to steal more than $300,000 between CD accounts without customer authorization to cover for her theft. Judy withdrew multiple cash transactions under $10,000 to avoid U.S. federal government cash withdrawals reporting requirements. She also closed the CD accounts without customers' authorization to avoid detection. She identified obscure accounts and believed that:  No one would miss the funds. The stolen funds were small portions of the accounts. The bank wasn't paying attention. The victims could afford these small amounts. Insurance would cover the bank and victims.  After the bank discovered the thefts, Judy did file for divorce but later opted for counseling and therapy instead.

Choose ONE of the three short essay questions to develop into your own argument.  Be sure to completely respond to the prompt you choose in 5-7 paragraphs. In order to receive full credit, you will need to define all elements of the question, describe the scenes in which you are discussing, provide vivid examples from the text to further your claim, and expand upon and relate to the thematic issues covered in class.  Correctly identify the number of the prompt in which you are responding next to your answer.  Throughout the play, Hamlet claims to be feigning madness, but his portrayal of a madman is so intense and so convincing that many readers believe that Hamlet actually slips into insanity at certain moments in the play.  Is this true, or is Hamlet merely play-acting insanity? Be sure to cite evidence for either claim. Suicide is an important theme in Hamlet. Discuss how the play treats the idea of suicide morally, religiously, and aesthetically, with particular attention to Hamlet's important statements about suicide, specifically in the "To be, or not to be" soliloquy. Why does Hamlet believe that, although capable of suicide, most human beings choose to live, despite the cruelty, pain, and injustice of the world? Provide an insightful analysis of Hamlet's "To be, or not to be" soliloquy.  What is going on in the play at the time of the soliloquy? How does Hamlet feel while contemplating suicide during the soliloquy?  What is the reader able to learn from this? Justification of vengeance is a major theme discussed throughout the play. Choose a particular character and explain if the actions they took in the name of revenge were justified or not. Provide specific reasons and examples from the play to support your ideas.

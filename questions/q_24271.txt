Consider an ideal silicon-based MOS capacitor that consists of a uniformly doped n-type silicon (the donor concentration is 3x1015 cm-3, 100% dopant ionized), a 7-nm-thick silicon dioxide, and aluminum as the metal section. The material parameters are listed below: The work function of the aluminum is 4.1 eV; the electron affinity for SiO2 is 0.91 eV, the electron affinity of silicon is 4.05eV; the bandgap of silicon is 1.12 eV.  Let the silicon bulk is electrically grounded and the externally applied voltage (VG) is applied on the aluminum gate terminal.  Assume the system is at the room temperature (T = 300 K).  At such temperature, the intrinsic carrier concentration for silicon is 1010  cm-3 , the dielectric constant for silicon is 11.9; the dielectric constant for SiO2 is 3.9; and the free space permittivity is 8.85x10-14 F/cm.  The electric charge is 1.6x10 -19 C and the Boltzmann constant is 1.38x10-23 J/s.  Answer the following questions:  (3 points) What is the name of the MOS capacitor? [name] (3 points) What is the flat-band voltage of this device? [VFB] V (4 points) What is the threshold voltage of this device? [VT] V (4 points) If VG = 1 V, identify the biasing mode. [mode_1V] (6 points) If VG = -2 V, determine the voltage drop across the oxide layer. [Vox] V

In an effort to control native Americans in the West, the U.S. Army began to use:
Bishop has a flock of Plymouth Rock chickens. She selects the heaviest 2% of her roosters based on their own 8-week weight. Her roosters (sires) average 0.75 years of age when their offspring are born. She saves the heaviest 10% of her hens based on their own 8-week weight with a generation interval of 1.0 year. Assume the h2WT = .36, sBV = .90 lb, and sP = 1.4 lb. Average 8-week weight before selection began was 6.5 lbs.    What is the expected genetic response per year when mating the selected roosters and hens together based on phenotype?                    2. What is the expected genetic response per year in 8-week weight when selecting males based on egg weight EPD with the following information? h2EW = .45         sPEW = 4.6 g         rBVWT,BVEW = .00 Roosters that Ms. Bishop purchased ranked in the top 5% of the breed for Egg Weight EPD.                 3. Which selection strategy works the best to increase 8-week weight and why?
Heterogeneity among members of a consumption or brand community can sometimes generate conflicts and weaken communal bonds among its members. However, other studies have found that intragroup heterogeneity can actually strengthen a brand community when:

A sled on ice moves in the ways described in questions 1-7 below. Friction is so small that it can be ignored. A person wearing spiked shoes standing on the ice can apply a force to the sled and push it along the ice. Choose the one force (A through G) which would keep the sled moving as described in each statement below. Across the 7 questions, you may use a choice more than once or not at all but choose only one answer for each. If you think that none is correct, answer choice J.  Question 4: Which force would keep the sled moving toward the left and speeding up at a steady rate (constant acceleration)?

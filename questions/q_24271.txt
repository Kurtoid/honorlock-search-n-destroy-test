(Note: the symbols below MAY NOT be listed in the order in which they are calculated. Just select the appropriate blank to fill in as you work out your calculations.)  The value of "p" is  [p].  The value of "q" is  [q].  The value of "p2" is [p2]. The value of "q2" is  [q2]. The value of "2pq" is  [2pq].  The actual count for the number of individuals who are heterozygous dominant is  [heterozygousdominant].   In the Hardy-Weinberg equation,  p2 represents [Q7].

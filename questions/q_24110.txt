SPSS is to be used to construct a multiple regression model for a data set with two independent variables (x1 and x2) and dependent variable y. Before analyzing the model, diagnostics were generated to check underlying assumptions. Cook's distances were computed for each data point, and the largest (in absolute value) was found to be 1.41.      Cook's distances can be used to check for [a1].  A suggested rule of thumb is to investigate any data point with Cook's distance [a2]. Since the largest value of Cook's distance for the data points in the model was found to be 1.41, there [a3] a need for further investigation of some data points.

11.  You suspect that a particular phenotype is the result of several genes being expressed together (polygenic inheritance).  You decide to document the occurrence of the phenotype in a population, so you sample about 1,000 people.  Which of the following characteristics are you likely to document if the phenotype is indeed polygenic?  Select all correct choices.

Questionnaires are used in ____ research.
To find the moment of inertia about the base of this object, I would break this object into two parts (big rectangle and small rectangle).  If I want to find the moment of inertia for the small rectangle, I would need to use the PAT.   Complete the PAT expression for the small rectangle (do not calculate the expression).  For the small rectangle:  (Ic is the centroidal moment of inertia that we have been calling "I-bar") Ix = (1/12)*(2)*(5^3) + (2)(5)(d)2 d in this equation = [ans]

Which is not a true statement regarding a microbe's pathogenicity?
Brown et al. and Morwood et al. reported in 2004 that they had found skeletal remains of a previously unknown type of hominin, now dubbed Homo floresiensis, on the Indonesian island of Flores. These hominins were small (approximately 1 meter tall) with small braincases (approximately 380 cubic centimeters) as compared with other hominins. The remains of H. floresiensis were found alongside handmade stone tools and the remains of dwarf elephants that also inhabited the island, suggesting that H. floresiensis was able both to make tools and to coordinate the hunting of animals much larger than itself. H. floresiensis is estimated to have lived at the site where the remains were found from at least 38,000 years ago to 18,000 years ago.   It is speculated that H. floresiensis and H. sapiens may have lived on Flores concurrently. Suppose researchers obtained mitochondrial DNA samples from the H. floresiensis remains, amplified a 1,000-base-pair sequence via PCR, and compared it to that of several currently living H. sapiens native to Indonesia, North Africa, and North America. Also suppose H. floresiensis were found to differ from the average Indonesian H. sapiens in 28 base pairs, from the average North African H. sapiens in 51 base pairs, and from the average North American H. sapiens in 53 base pairs, while two randomly selected H. sapiens differed from each other in an average of 21 base pairs. What would you surmise from these data?

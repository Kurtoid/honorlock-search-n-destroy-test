Three thieves agreed to commit a series of smash-and-grab robberies of high-end retail stores. The first thief was to procure disguises, the second agreed to find a car to be used in the getaway, and the third would investigate the potential target stores and select the ones to rob. The thieves completed their tasks, with the first thief stealing masks from a costume shop. The morning of the robberies, the first thief was hit by a car while crossing the street.

She completed the program, received her certificate and graduated highest in her class.  What is the society's perception of Deaf people and what to take away from the experience.

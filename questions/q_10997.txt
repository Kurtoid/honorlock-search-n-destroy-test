Case Study #4a   Scenario Jackson is a baby whose mom, Sandy, notices that he seems to have diaper rash very often. One morning while changing him, Sandy sees that his buttocks seem particularly red and that small, bubbly blisters seem to be forming. When she cleaned him up, he was noticeably in pain from it, even though she tried hard to be gentle on his skin.Being a new mom, she decided to have Jackson's pediatrician look at the rash, and she made an appointment for the next day.   Signs and Symptoms On the morning of the appointment, Jackson was very fussy, and when Sandy checked his diaper, she saw that the blisters had spread and now appeared crusty, while the redness was moving down his legs and across his scrotum. She gently tried to clean him up, and when she rubbed with the wipe lightly, his skin sloughed off too. Now panicked, she loaded him into the car and raced to the pediatrician.The doctor looked at the rash, and also noted that Jackson had a fever. She ordered blood and fecal cultures and sent him to the hospital.   Testing Blood cultures were positive for growth overnight. The microbiology technologist prepared subcultures on new media, including a blood agar plate and a mannitol salt agar plate. Colonies grew on both types of media overnight.    Question: Based on the media used, which of the following organisms is most likely suspected?

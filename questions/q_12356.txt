Executives at QuikShrink, a weight loss supplement company, wanted to determine whether their supplements help people lose weight more quickly than more traditional weight loss methods. The executives hired Dr. Stoopid to evaluate three different weight loss programs. Plan A included only diet/nutritional requirements for all participants. Plan B emphasized a regular exercise program. Plan C involved taking QuikShrink weight loss supplements. Dr. Stoopid recruited 10 people from a local WeightWatchers meeting to use Plan A. He recruited 10 people from the local gym to use Plan B. He recruited 10 people from the local college to use Plan C. All of the participants were instructed not to engage in any other weight loss method besides the one that they were assigned to. All 30 participants followed their assigned weight loss plans for 3 months. The Plan A and B groups lost the most weight, and Dr. Stoopid reported to the QuikShrink executives that their supplements did not work as well as the other weight loss methods.   The serious threat to internal validity in this study is...

DIRECTIONS: Choose the correct answer for each question. Shark Attack [A] The morning had started out well for 41-year-old surfer Sam Edwardes. Sam was with his housemate Dane near Belongil Beach in the Australian state of New South Wales. The waves looked good and Sam was sitting on his surfboard, waiting for the right time to begin his first attempt.[B] Suddenly, horror struck. A great white shark rose from beneath the surface and pushed him off his board with great force. Edwardes felt a sharp pain in his leg and began to scream. As quickly as he possibly could, he got back on his board and began paddling toward the beach. As he paddled toward the shore, he shouted for help and warned other surfers about the shark.[C] When he arrived on the beach, his housemate and others on the sand realized how bad the damage was. The scene was extremely frightening. The shark had bitten a large piece out of his leg and blood was spilling out quickly. The shark had also taken a large chunk out of his surfboard.[D] Fortunately, Edwardes and those around him remained remarkably calm. His housemate and others on the beach called for an ambulance and helped stop the blood flow with a number of surfing ropes. Although Edwardes was confused about what was happening to him, he stayed calm enough to thank those around him for helping him. He was soon airlifted1 to a nearby hospital.[E] After surgery lasting four and a half hours, it became clear that Edwardes had been extremely lucky. The shark had missed some of the most important arteries2 and nerves.3 Because of this, not only was he able to survive, but there is a good chance that he will be able to surf again in the future. 1 To be airlifted is to be transported by airplane or helicopter. 2 An artery is a tube in the body that carries blood from the heart to other parts of the body.3 A nerve is a part of the body that sends messages between the brain and other parts of the body, allowing for movement and feeling.In paragraph A, the word housemate means ________.

Suppose a battery manufacturer claims that their batteries will give a mean of 40 hours of use.  The quality control department is concerned that the value is less than 40 hours.  They take a random sample of 10 batteries and measure the number of hours of use for each battery.  The mean lifetime for the sample of 10 batteries is 39.4 hours with a standard deviation of 3 hours. Assume that the battery life of this manufacturer's batteries is normally distributed.   Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean lifetime of the batteries made by this manufacturer.   The critical value used to calculate this interval is [a]. Round your answer to three decimal places. The standard error used to calculate this interval is [b]. Round your answer to three decimal places.   The mean lifetime of the batteries made by this manufacturer is between [c] and [d] hours. Round your answers to one decimal place.

Answer the following questions using the correct form of the Imperfect verb tense.
In a simple pendulum, the period is given by the relationship 2(pi)(L/g).5, where L is the length of the pendulum and g is the acceleration due to gravity, 9.8m/s2, and the release angle is less than 15 degrees.   If the period of a .25 kg pendulum (bob mass) is .256s, what is the period of a pendulum with a bob of .50 kg, if L remains the same?  Assume the rod holding the bob is massless and there is no friction at the pivot point.

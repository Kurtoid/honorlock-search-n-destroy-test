Hosts A and B are directly connected with a 120 MBps link over a single TCP connection. Host A is sending an enormous file over the connection. Host A can transmit at 100 MBps. No other traffic is on the link. The application at Host B reads data from the receive buffer at 60 MBps. Once the receive buffer is full, what is the average rate for sending the rest of the file from Host A to Host B?

Design an Armstrong FM modulator to generate an FM with a carrier frequency of 200 MHz, the message signal is bandlimited to B=25 kHz and frequency deviation of 100K Hz. A narrow-band FM generator is available at a carrier frequency of 100 KHz and a frequency deviation of 125 Hz. The stock room has an oscillator with frequency up to 5 Mhz, a BPF with adjustable central frequency up to 5.5MHz and bandwidth up to 1MHz, and four frequency multipliers (three double (2) and two (10)s). Fill in the blanks for Frequency multipliers M1[M1],  M2[M2] ,   Modulation index=[index],  Carson bandwidth=[Band] KHz. {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 20, 40, 50, 100, 250, 500 }  Sketch the following  design and spectrum and submit them in Question 5, 3 pt total.  Draw diagram and show all design parameters for example, central frequency and bandwidth for BPF, frequency of oscillator, and frequency multipliers (2pts) Sketch spectrum of this FM signal for input signal of m(t)=

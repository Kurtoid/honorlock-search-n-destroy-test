Mr. Rickey and the Game "Some honors have been tendered," he said, "some honorary degrees offered because of my part in bringing Jackie Robinson into the major leagues." 5 He frowned and shook his head vigorously. "No, no, no. I have declined them all. To accept honors, public applause for signing a superlative ballplayer to a 10 contract? I would be ashamed!" He turned to look out the window and turned back. "Suppose," he demanded, "I hear that Billy Jones down the street has attained 15 the age of 21. Suppose I go to Billy and say, 'You come up with me to the polling place.' And then at the polling place I take Billy by the arm and march up to the clerks and say, 'This is Billy Jones, 20 native American, 21 years of age,' and I demand that he be given the right to cast a ballot!" Rickey leaned over the desk, his eyes flashing. 25 "Would anyone but a lunatic expect to be applauded for that?" It immediately became clear that although Rickey deprecated his right to applause, he had never minimized the 30 difficulties of bringing the first Negro into organized baseball. "I talked to sociologists," he said, "and to Negro leaders. With their counsel, I worked out what I considered to be the 35 six essential points to be considered." He started to count on his fingers. "Number one," he said, "the man we finally chose had to be right off the field. Off the field. 40 "Number two, he had to be right on the field. If he turned out to be a lemon, our efforts would fail for that reason alone. "Number three, the reaction of his own race had to be right. 45 "Number four, the reaction of press and public had to be right. "Number five, we had to have a place to put him. "Number six, the reaction of his fellow 50 players had to be right. "In Jackie Robinson, we found the man to take care of points one and two. He was eminently right off and on the field. We did not settle on Robinson until after 55 we had invested $25,000 in scouting for a man whose name we did not then know."

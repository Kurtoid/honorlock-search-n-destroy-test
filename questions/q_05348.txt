Remember, once time runs out, it is too late to upload your Simio file without significant penalty in points.  You should stop you modeling efforts around 11:00 since at 11:05 you will no longer be able to upload your file. Only two pages of single-sided notes are allowed.  The only scratch paper are the two pages you have for notes.  Handheld calculators are allowed, but not your cell phone.  Do not use the Math.If( ) function. When you are finished, close Simio, then upload the Simio (.spfx) file before time runs out.  Only one upload is allowed. Problem Description There are four truck arrivals (make these green colored entities) per day scheduled to arrive at at 6AM, 10AM, noon, and 4PM each day.  The actual arrival times of the trucks are not always exactly at their scheduled times but can be as much as 5 minutes early or as much as 15 minutes late; however, the trucks are most often on time.  Each truck delivers exactly 3 parts.  To model this truck arrival process, use the "Arrival Table" Mode in a source.  Also, for your simulation, let TimeNow=0 refer to 6AM.  In addition to parts arriving by truck, there are individually arriving parts (make these blue colored entities) that have exponentially distributed inter-arrival times where the mean inter-arrival time depends on the time of day (in other words, the arrival process of blue entities is a non-stationary Poisson process).  Specifically, between 6AM and noon the mean time between arrivals is 20 minutes, between noon and 6PM the mean time between arrivals is 10 minutes, and between 6PM and 6AM the mean time between arrivals is 30 minutes. All parts first go to a batch processor.  This batch processor services two parts at a time and the processing time has a Pert distribution with parameters 20, 25, 30 minutes.  Both parts in the batch must have the same color (i.e., truck arrivals are always paired with truck arrivals and individual arrivals are always paired with other individual arriving parts).  For verification purposes, you should animate the batches so a visual check can be made that the batches sizes are two and both parts in the batch are the same color.  Hint:  to keep parts from being backed up, it helps to initially release two parent entities for the batch processor. After the batch processor, all parts are processed through a single-server processor that treats each part individually (i.e., the batches do not stay together as a unit after the batch processor).  The processing time for each individual green entity is exponentially distributed with mean 15 minutes.  The processing time for each individual blue entity is exponentially distributed with mean 12 minutes.  After the single-server processor, all parts leave the system.  The following travel times are 5 minutes:  (1) from green source to the batch processor, (2) from blue source to the batch processor, (3) from the batch processor to the single-server processor, and (4) from the single-server processor to the exit of the system. All assignment statements and tallies must be done through Processes.  Thus, assignments and data placed in tallies not from within Processes will be ignored. Run the simulation for 50 days with only one replication (i.e., no experiment and no warmup period) and estimate the following based on the 50 days:  (1) The average total number of blue parts in the system at 7AM, (2) the total daily throughput of parts for the system (throughput includes both blue and green parts, i.e., one number), and (3) the average time (in minutes) that a blue part that arrives between 6PM and 6AM spends in the system.  (Note that (3) is the time in system averaged only over those parts that are blue and arrive to the system at night.)  These three values must appear in the Results tab. In a floor label, give the expected (i.e., theoretical) value for the daily throughput.

Departmental Neuromuscular Junction Quiz                        Jarrod was an active man who was extremely interested in physical fitness.  Running, going to the gym, and being outdoors were a major part of Jarrod's life.  When Jarrod became unable to complete a run or his weight exercises, he became worried.  He was experiencing muscle weakness and fatigue more and more frequently in his daily life.  Where Jarrod had once been able to go to the gym three days a week for weight training and lift one hundred sixty pounds, he was now lucky to lift seventy-five pounds for just one full repetition before his muscles were no longer able to continue.    His doctor told him he had an autoimmune disorder called Myasthenia gravis where the body's immune system attacks the skeletal muscle cells, making them respond slower to the nervous system and present weaker contractions.  Jarrod didn't understand what any of that meant so the doctor proceeded to explain to him the importance of the nerves and muscles working together. The neuromuscular junction is an important communication point in the human body.  This junction illustrates how the nervous system and the muscular system use electric and chemical signals to communicate.  This communication allows for our conscious control of skeletal muscles, so it's vital to our daily functions. For this junction to work we must first produce an action potential in a motor neuron.  This action potential will propagate down an axon and cause voltage-gated calcium channels to open.  The calcium ion will enter the presynaptic terminal and initiate the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  The acetylcholine will be released by exocytosis and diffuse across the synapse and bind to ligand-gated sodium channels on the postsynaptic membrane (skeletal muscle).  This will cause the ligand-gated sodium channels to open and allow sodium to enter the cell membrane of the skeletal muscle.  Once threshold is passed, an action potential is generated along the cell membrane of the skeletal muscle.  Muscle contraction will occur soon after.   This figure is associated with the related text information and to answers to questions 1 - 10 following.      For the muscle to relax, acetylcholine must be removed from the sodium channels by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.  This will break down the acetylcholine into acetic acid and choline.  The choline will be transported back into the terminal end of the axon and the acetic acid diffuses away from the synapse. The doctor proceeded to explain that in individuals with Myasthenia gravis, the person's immune system attacks and destroys the ligand-gated sodium channels on the postsynaptic membrane of the skeletal muscle cell.  With fewer ligand-gated sodium channels, it takes longer for the threshold to be met to generate an action potential and weakens the contraction strength of the muscle. Jarrod was shocked to learn that it was his own body that had caused the disease and to also learn that his condition was incurable.  His doctor informed him that he could use corticosteroids and immunosuppressant medicines to prevent any further attacks, but the current damage was permanent.  Jarrod would be unable to continue living as physically active as he had previously been, but in time he would learn the extent of his physical capabilities and slowly define a new normal for his life.   Action potentials must propagate down what structure of a neuron to reach the appropriate ion channels?

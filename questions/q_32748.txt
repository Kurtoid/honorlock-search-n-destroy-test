Draw one elementary step per reaction arrow. Be sure to draw all electron lone-pairs; show all formal charges; and use curved-arrow notation to show the movement of electrons. Write neatly and clearly. Ambiguity will be assumed to be incorrect. Third, use the reaction coordinate graph below to calculate the activation energy (Ea) for the rate-determining step (RDS) as well as the enthalpy of reaction ([?]H). Write answers and show work in box C. Fourth, draw the structure of the TS-B (transition state B) in box D. Use dashed lines to indicate partial bonds. Use the delta symbol to indicate partial positive ([?]+) or partial negative ([?]-) charge on atoms. Include all lone-pairs of electrons.

Yeast growth can be modeled using the following two balanced chemical reactions:   Reaction 1:       C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2 - 6 H2O + 6 CO2 Reaction 2:       11 C6H12O6 (glucose) + 2.1 O2- C3.92H6.5O1.94 (biomass) + 2.75 CO2 + 3.42 H2O   Reaction 1 uses glucose to generate energy by breaking glucose down into water and carbon dioxide.  Reaction 2 uses glucose to produce more yeast (i.e., biomass).   In an open-flow reactor operating at steady-state, 360 lb / day of glucose is fed to the reactor.  Oxygen is fed to the reactor in a separate stream at 96 lb / day. The gases (O2 and CO2) exit the reactor in an "off gas" stream. All other compounds exit in the product stream. The fraction conversion of oxygen is 0.80. The fraction conversion of glucose is 0.90.    Please perform a complete DOF analysis of the system. What is the mole ratio of biomass to glucose in the product stream? What is the total mole flow rate of "off gas" stream?    SHOW ALL YOUR WORK.

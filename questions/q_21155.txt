Daniela, an unmarried individual, operates an independent, privately owned company, MOVE YOUR TAIL-INGS(r). She contracts independently with corporations engaged in large mining and drilling projects. Daniela's business hauls mining-debris and other refuse to offsite disposal areas. In July 2017 Daniela purchased a new Caterpillar 797F. The 797F is an off-highway, ultra-class, two-axle, mechanical powertrain haul truck manufactured by Caterpillar Inc. It is used for high production mining and heavy-duty construction applications worldwide. The 797F is Caterpillar's largest, highest payload capacity haul truck, with 4000 horsepower. Fully loaded the weight of the 797F can reach 1,375,000 lbs. Each tire on the 797F is 13 ft. high and weighs 11,680 lbs. Six tires are required per truck (replacement cost per tire $40,000). The initial set of six tires is included in the purchase price Daniela paid. As stated above, in July of 2017, Daniela purchased and placed in service a 797F for $3,400,000. She sold the 797F this year, in January 2020, for $3,600,000. (797F production costs had caused the value to increase.) The 797F has a 10-year recovery period and Daniela's taxable income from her business apart from any deductions allowed for the purchase and depreciation of the 797F was $3,000,000 each year. She placed no other items in serviced in 2018. 1) Apply any available SS 179, and regular SS 168 deductions to this equipment (disregard SS 168(k)), and calculate her adjusted basis in the 797F for determining gain on the 2020 sale. Assume the SS 179 limitations for 2020 apply for 2017. (15 points). 2) Calculate her total gain, if any, on the 2020 sale, and characterize it for tax purposes. (15 points) 3) Alternatively, assume that she purchased the 797F in 2020 for $3,400,00 and the current 2020 version of SS 168(k) applied. How much of a deduction would she have been allowed for 2020 under SS 168(k)? For this question, do not apply SS 179. Assume Daniela's business income can absorb any SS 168(k) deduction she is allowed. (15 points), END OF EXAM
A man obtained a bank loan secured by a mortgage on an office building that he owned. After several years, the man conveyed the office building to a woman, who took title subject to the mortgage. The deed to the woman was not recorded. The woman took immediate possession of the building and made the mortgage payments for several years. Subsequently,  the  woman  stopped  making  payments  on  the  mortgage  loan,  and  the  bank  eventually  commenced foreclosure proceedings in which the man and the woman were both named parties. At the foreclosure sale, a third party purchased the building for less than the outstanding balance on the mortgage loan. The bank then sought to collect the deficiency from the woman. Is the bank entitled to collect the deficiency from the woman?

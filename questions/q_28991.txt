A large mass m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"} is on a horizontal, frictionless surface as shown in the figure. A smaller mass, m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"} is hanging from the pulley. The pulley has mass M{"version":"1.1","math":"M"} and radius R{"version":"1.1","math":"R"} and is in the shape of a solid sphere (moment of inertia 25MR2{"version":"1.1","math":"25MR2"}) and is able to rotate about its center of mass without friction. Let T1{"version":"1.1","math":"T1"} be the tension pulling m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"} and T2{"version":"1.1","math":"T2"} be the tension supporting m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"}. Symbolically set up the THREE equations you would need to find the magnitude of the acceleration of m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"}. There should be an equation based on the motion of m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"}, an equation based on the motion of m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"} and an equation based on the rotation of the pulley. You do not need to actually solve the system of equations, simply set them up. The equations should only contain variables given to you in the problem (m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"}, m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"}, M{"version":"1.1","math":"M"} and R{"version":"1.1","math":"R"}), three unknowns (two have already been mentioned) and universal constants or numbers. It is possible that some listed variables will cancel out.

Which of these is the oxidizing agent in the reaction shown? HINT: Think of 2H2  + O2 a 2H2O(l). Cu(s)     +   NO31-   a  Cu2+    +  NO2(g)
On October 15, the owner of a local tree farm telephoned the owner of a small gas station and offered to sell the gas station 100 cut evergreen trees for resale as Christmas trees in the gas station's parking lot for $2,500, not including delivery charges. The gas station owner accepted immediately. On October 17, the gas station owner sent the tree farm an e-mail confirming the deal for the sale of 100 trees for $2,500, and stating that it anticipated a waiver of the delivery charges because of the size of the order. On December 3, the tree farm owner again telephoned the gas station and stated that, due to a tree loss caused by a recent storm, the tree farm would not be able to supply any trees to the gas station. If the gas station brings suit against the tree farm and the tree farm asserts the Statute of Frauds as a defense, will the gas station prevail?

Kamala works for a large manufacturing company. She is a Democrat, an activist, and a labor union member. Kamala had no problems at work until she got a new boss who seemed to strongly believe that communications in the office should be limited to work-related topics only: the business of producing, selling, and delivering the company's goods. After Kamala chatted with her coworkers about work schedules and pay scales, Kamala's boss muttered, "You're lucky they outlawed the yellow dog contract." Kamala's boss is - in effect - referring to a company's ability to fire Kamala for:

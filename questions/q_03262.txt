Cells modulate their local microenvironment through autocrine and paracrine signaling. For example, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) play important roles in promoting cell proliferation. The resulting distribution of secreted factors in the microfluidic cell culture model may therefore induce different cell behaviors depending on the concentration of factors present. In autocrine signaling, _________. 1) the cell producing the messenger that will bind to receptors on its surface that can respond to that messenger 2) the messenger molecules travel only short distances through the extracellular space to cells that are in close proximity to the cell that is generating the message 3) the messenger molecules reach their target cells via passage through bloodstream 4) the messenger molecules are usually limited in their ability to travel around the body because they are inherently unstable or they are degraded by enzymes or they bind to extracellular matrix

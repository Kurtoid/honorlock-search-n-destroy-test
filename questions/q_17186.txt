Examine the graph investigating the effect of different lights on photosynthesis.  Based on what you know about reactants for photosynthesis, which light condition resulted in the greatest amount of photosynthesis? **NOTE: the y axis is NOT O2 produced, but rather CO2 available**
Use the quotient rule to find the derivative of the function g(x)=23x3-3x2-3x3-x+1{"version":"1.1","math":"g(x)=dfrac{dfrac{2}{3}x^3-3x^2-3}{x^3-x+1}"} at x=-1
Use this description for the next two questions: Problem:  Write a program that randomly generates 20 integer values one at a time each between 17 and 37, and then stores those values in an array of size 20 and returns the total sum of all the unique values (the program simply ignores duplicate numbers). To accomplish this, you will need to write two functions as well as a main. First, write a function (name it whatever you like) that accepts an integer array and an integer representing the size of the array as parameters. This function then randomly generates 20 numbers from the user and stores each in the array only if it is not a duplicate of another number already in the array.  (Implication: some of the values in the array may be "empty").  Carefully consider this function's return type. Second, write a function (name it whatever you like) that accepts an integer array and an integer representing the size of the array as parameters. This function then uses a for loop to sum the values in the array and returns that sum. Carefully consider this function's return type. Your main function should simply declare a 20 element array of integers, call the first and then the second function, and then print out the sum of the unique values (as returned from the second function). For simplicity, put all of your code in a single .cpp file and submit that file.

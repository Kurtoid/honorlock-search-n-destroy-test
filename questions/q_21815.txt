Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove. O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark 5 That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wand ring bark, Whose worth s unknown, although his height be taken.

In her Ted Talk "On Marriage," Stephanie Koontz stated "...in the last 35 years, all of those obstacles to the radical implications of the love match have been overturned and the result has been a tremendous paradox...

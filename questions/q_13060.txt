First, discuss the rhetoric employed by Casas: in his writing, how did he attempt to convince his audience that the exploitation of indigenous Americans should be ended? Cite as many examples as you can remember, always noting the effect these examples had on his writing. What other rhetorical strategies did he employ? Then, compare his work with the Narrative of Mary Rowlandson. What were their differing attitudes towards Indigenous Americans? How did this manifest in their language?

(If you forget the name of a specific work, you can describe it.)     Remember: extra credit may be offered to students who write an especially specific, thoughtful, well-constructed essay.

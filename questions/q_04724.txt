In your own words, explain the physiology behind thresholds.  Make sure you include physiology that is specific to each threshold (lactate, anaerobic, and ventilatory thresholds).
The following questions are True/False. Please use a T for true and an F for false. [blank1] Functional assessment is the process of gathering information about the antecedents and consequences that are functionally related to the occurrence of a problem behavior. [blank2] Information about the function of behavior will help you identify the antecedents that serve as establishing operations for the behavior and the reinforcing consequences that maintain the behavior. [blank3] Direct observation methods (ABC observations) do not demonstrate functional relations.   [blank4] Indirect and descriptive assessments identify functional relations.  [blank5] In the Iwata et al. (1982/1994) study, the "social disapproval" condition was designed to provide negative reinforcement for SIB.  [blank6] In a functional analysis, responding in each test condition is compared to responding in each control condition.

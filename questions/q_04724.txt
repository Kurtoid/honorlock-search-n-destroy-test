Consider the following project.     Activity  Predecessor  Optimistic   Most likely   Pessimistic     1  --  2   5   10     2  1  6   8   10     3  1  5   7   13     4  3  3   8   10     5  2,3  1   4   8     6  2  2   2   4     7  4,5,6  5   8   13     1. Perform the PERT analysis to find the expected project completion time, variance of project completion time, and probability that the project is completed on or before due date which is 32 days (5 points). The company has the following policy:  If a project cannot be finished within the specified time, the managers either try to allocate resources to improve the time estimates thereby the probability of project completion by the due date or try to negotiate a longer time to finish to project. After evaluating the current resources on hand and their relationship with the client, they have gathered following information:  shortening most likely time of activities 4, 5, and 6, by one day costs $650 each ( For each activity 4,5,6, you can reduce as many days as possible). Other activities cannot be crashed. Further extending the due date by one day costs the company $1000 per day in penalty.  If the company wants to improve the probability of project completion to 99%, calculate the following: 2. What is the cost of achieving 99% probability by improving the activity times. Clearly indicate the following: Project completion time and variance to achieve 99% probability assuming due date is 32. (4 points) By how many days each activity time is reduces, (6 points) total cost to reduce the activity time (2 points) Z value corresponding to 99% probability is 2.33 3. Assuming the activity times are unchanged (no crashing), what should be the negotiated due date for you to achieve 99% project completion? What is the associated cost? (2 points) 4. Which method would you recommend to the management? (1 points)

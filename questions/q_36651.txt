Answer questions 21 through 28 using the following paragraphStatic ElectricityMost of us remember a painful incident when sparks blasted our hands after touching metal objects. Or, remember the game we used to play as kids where we would rub a balloon against a wool sweater and then see how it sticks to the wall? These are examples of "static electricity".Though static electricity is a common phenomenon its cause is quite mysterious and often unknown.Static electricity is ususally caused by the friction of two objects against each other, like the sole of your shoes against the carpet. However no friction is required in order for static electricity to occur. A need for friction to create static electricity is a common misconception held by many people. It is true that friction can increase the likelihood of static electricity, however it is not the cause. The true cause is the separation of negative and positive charges.Every  object is composed of a collection of positive and negative electric charges. Usually the number of positive charges and the number of negative charges is equal. Static electricity (more correctly called "net electric charge") occurs whenever the number of positive and negative electric charges is not perfectly equal.How does it happen? Let's take the example of walking across a carpeted room. Whenever we walk, the soles of our shoes absorb some negative charge found in the carpet. We leave behind electric positive footprints and our bodies acquire some negative charges. This process goes on for sometime until our body achieves a high level of negative charge. The next time that we touch someone or something else we will get zapped, as the imbalanced charge is shared between us and the other person or object. The spark is painful because it is extremely hot. It creates tiny burned areas on our skin that hurt for  couple of secondsThere is a simple way to avoid shocks caused by static electricity. Before touching a doorknob, a car door, etc, first touch it with a car key. The electric static sparks will blast the key rather than your hand, and it will painlessly dscharge your body. After being discharged you can safely touch metal object. However, you might want to be aware of the fact that if you walk around some more you will acquire new static electricity and need to discharge yourself again.Why is touching a door knob with a key considered a simple way to avoid static electricity?

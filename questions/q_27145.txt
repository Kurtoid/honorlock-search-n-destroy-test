In the late 90's the Russian default triggered a global crisis that affected an important number of emerging economies. Investors faced significant uncertainty, so they left emerging economies and went to locations with safe and riskless assets, such as the US. Chile was among the emerging economies that started experiencing significant capital outflows and a depreciation of the peso against the dollar. The governor of the Chilean Central Bank at the moment took an unprecedented action: he sharply increased the interest rate from roughly 6 percentage points to 13 percentage points (this increase was very large for common standards). Why would the governor engage in something like this? Provide an explanation through the lens of what we have studied in the course so far.

Question IIB The County of Mobile in the state of Alabama owns a parking garage located at a public Community College whose first floor is rented out to local food service businesses for the sale of prepared food items to students and members of the general public.  All of the restaurants are privately owned and maintained.  They pay for their own utilities and lease the space from the College.  Patrons do not have to pay to park. Other than the rents, the College does not receive any monies from the profits of the restaurants.  At a previous time, all of the original owners of the restaurants had organized and formed a "Tenant's Association" and signed a covenant agreeing not to serve food in their restaurants to any black or Japanese persons.  The agreement also provided that the covenant would be part of and apply to any future sale of the businesses.  One of the original owners of the restaurants sold his restaurant to a Japanese individual, Mr. Fujisaki.  Mr. Fujisaki's new business opens its doors to all races and nationalities.  The other existing original owners of the restaurants in the building sue in state court for an injunction to prevent the new owner from selling to blacks or Japanese and requesting that the court nullify the sale as a violation of the covenant.  The state court agrees with the original owners and issues the injunction.  Several appeals later, the case reaches the Supreme Court of the United States.  Mr. Fujisaki claims the covenant and enforcement thereof is unconstitutional and seeks protection through the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. QUESTION:  IS THERE STATE ACTION OR AN EXCEPTION(S) TO THE STATE ACTION DOCTRINE THAT WOULD APPLY IN THIS CASE TRIGGERING CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY THE 14TH AMENDMENT?    EXPLAIN WHY OR WHY NOT.  USE CASES AND LAW DISCUSSED IN CLASS IN YOUR ANALYSIS.

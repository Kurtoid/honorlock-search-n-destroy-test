Title of essay: "Letter from Birmingham Jail"Author: Martin Luther King, Jr.  I would agree with St. Augustine that "an unjust law is no law at all." . . . How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? . . . An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with moral law.

Hence segregation is not only politically, economically, and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation and existential expression of man's tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right, and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.King's assumption, based in part on Augustine's observation that "an unjust law is no law at all," can be paraphrased correctly to mean that

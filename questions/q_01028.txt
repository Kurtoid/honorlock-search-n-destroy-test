You are a dairy farmer and interested in boosting milk production from your herd of 1000 milk-producing cows. You classify your cows as low, and high milk producers based on monthly records that you've kept over the last 10 months. You decide to genotype all of them, and find the following haplotypes on 1 mega-base regions on three different chromosomes that appear to be significant in terms of milk production in your stock.                   A            C             T         T     haplotype 1 Chr1 ____________________________                  G            C             A         G    haplotype 2                C               A         A        haplotype 3 Chr5_______________________                C               G         C        haplotype 4                             C     T                haplotype 5 Chr 18_____________________                            A     A                haplotype 6 You find that all of the low milk producers have haplotype 2, 3 and 5 on Chromosomes 1, 5 and 18. 60% of the high milk producers have haplotypes 1, 3 and 6 and the other 40% have haplotypes 1, 4 and 5. Which 1 mega-base region(s) would you sequence to find the genes involved in milk production?

A jigsaw puzzle consists of straight edged (including the four corners) and non-straight edged pieces.  When a jigsaw piece is randomly selected from the box, there is about a 12% chance of selecting a straight edged piece.  You take a simple random sample of 6 jigsaw pieces from the box.  Let X = the number of pieces that have a straight edge.  The distribution of X is binomial with n = 6 and p = 0.12.   a. How would you write the distribution of X using symbols? [symbols]   b. What is the sample space of this distribution? [sspace]   c. What is the probability of getting 2 or 3 straight edged pieces from the 6 randomly selected pieces? [or]   d. How many straight edged pieces would you expect to get out of the 6 randomly selected pieces? [expected]

You can use HTML editor to build Punnett Square. Click on the 3 dots in the upper right hand corner of the answer space.  Then click on the table and insert a table that is 3 x 3.  Put the Dad's genotype on one side and the mom's genotype on the top.  Recreate this table.   Fill in the table and answer the question.  Try, I want to see a table.  Show your work. Please clearly indicate your answer, like Answer: Z.  In humans, Brown eyes, B, are dominant and blue eyes, b, are recessive. If Dad is homozygous dominant (BB) and mom is heterozygous (Bb), which best represents the genotypic ratio of the offspring?  Do the Punnett square and see what you get for the pairs of alleles. A. 1BB : 1Bb B. all Bb C. 1Brown : 1 Blue D. All Brown E. All Blue Answer:

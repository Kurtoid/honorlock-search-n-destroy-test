Input pattern abc = 101 is applied to the circuit shown in Figure 3, and concurrent fault simulation is used. Submit everything on-line.             (a) List all faults detected by test pattern abc = 101, and drop all faults detected.              (b) Test pattern abc is changed from abc = 101 to abc = 111.

(c) Which bad gate(s) will be converged to good gate(s) due to the input change  in (b)?         (d) Perform bad gate divergence due to the input change in (b) and list all faults detected.

You want to run a gel to check if the PCR product contains the desired product. Draw the gel electrophoresis results, assuming the PCR worked perfectly. Include a DNA ladder (with 2000 bp, 1000 bp, 500 bp and 100 bp bands), positive control, Super_Agility1 sample, and negative control. Label each lane accordingly. (4 points).  Also indicate the expected size of the amplified fragment. (1.5 points)

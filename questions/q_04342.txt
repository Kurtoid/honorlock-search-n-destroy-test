For the fading channel in the previous question: Assume that a signal with a 50 kHz bandwidth is being transmitted at 2 GHz through this channel to a mobile that is traveling at 21 m/s. Assume that the data rate on this channel is 4kbps and the modulation is BPSK.  What is the maximum Doppler frequency , fm, for this channel? What is the coherence time with correlation >=0.5 for this channel (i.e. using the restrictive, conservative time coherence definition )? Is this a slow fading channel relative to correlation >=0.5 ?  What would the answer to 3. be if the modulation were changed to 256QAM (8 bits/symbol) but the bit rate stays the same? (Justify your answer)

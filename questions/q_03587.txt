In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Shands Hospital at UF has decided to expand its hospital room capacity with an additional 72 upgraded patient care rooms to the main building. Rooms are approximately 500 square feet (sq ft) in size and are expected to cost $600/sq ft fully equipped at buildout.

What is the estimated final cost based on progress through Month 5? 7. What is the estimated total time of completion (in months)? 8.

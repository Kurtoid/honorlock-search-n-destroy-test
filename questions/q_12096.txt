At the end of the 4-week period, each individual takes a standardized memory test (large numbers indicate better memory). The scores from the sample produced a mean of M = 32. In the general population, the standardized memory test is known to have a mean of u = 30 and s = 4. Do the sample data support the conclusion that the herbal supplement influenced memory? To answer this question, go through the 7 steps for hypothesis testing and use a = .05 (critical value = +-1.96).

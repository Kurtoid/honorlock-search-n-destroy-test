Use this information for the following five questions. Suppose that an investor has a 3-year investment horizon. The investor considers purchasing a bond with the face value of $1,000, the maturity of 10 years, and the coupon rate of 8%. This bond is selling at par. The investor's expectations are as follows:   The first two semi-annual coupon payments can be reinvested from the time of receipt to the end of the investment horizon at 7%.  The last four semi-annual coupon payments can be reinvested from the time of receipts to the end of the investment horizon at 11%. At the end of the investment horizon, the 7-year bond will be selling to offer a YTM of 9%.  We assume flat term structure and semi-annual compounding here. We want to calculate the total rate of return based on these expectations.

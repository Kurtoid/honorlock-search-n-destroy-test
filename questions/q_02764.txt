A new game, Headless Hockey, is being developed for the emerging sports-horror genre. The AI is built with a nondeterministic finite state machine. This state machine is evaluated every frame of the simulation. The game is to be released on both PC and PS4. The PS4 version runs at an average frame rate of 30 fps and the PC version can be configured to run at up to 120 fps. With the partial state machine presented below, consider how the behavior of the same agent on the PC (120 fps) and PS4 (30 fps) may differ. State Hold Position involves the hockey player maintaining an assigned position on the ice. State Fist Fight involves the hockey player fighting with an opponent hockey player (and then going to the penalty box). For update of the state machine that involves T1, the variable p is assigned from a random number generator a value between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). FIGHT_THRESH is a constant between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive).    Consider the scenario above for the next questions.

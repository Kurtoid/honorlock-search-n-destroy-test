Diagnostic tests of medical conditions have several results. The test result can be positive or negative. A positive test (+) indicates the patient has the condition. A negative test (-) indicates the patient does not have the condition. Remember, a positive test does not prove the patient has the condition. Additional medical work may be required. Consider a random sample of 131 patients, some of whom have a medical condition and some of whom do not. Results of a new diagnostic test for the condition are shown.     Condition Present Condition Absent Row Total   Test Result + 111 20 131   Test Result - 20 60 80   Column Total 131 80 211   Assume that the sample is representative of the entire population. For a person selected at random, find P(getting test result - and condition absent). Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.

There are two questions remaining on this exam, but you can choose which one you will answer. Your options for which question to answer are shown below. Read these questions, then take mental note of which one you prefer to answer: Option A: Suppose that a new disease has swept across Washington state. Those who are infected with this disease develop lesions on the skin. Many scientists suspect that the new disease is caused by a pathogen called Bobo Virus. Scientists have found that this virus is relatively easy to grow in the laboratory using cell culture. There is also a nice animal model for studying the pathogenic effects of this virus (Bobo Virus causes the same symptoms in mice as they do in humans). Through their work, scientists have found that Bobo Virus causes respiratory illness (instead of skin lesions) in 3% of the animals infected. (a) In correct order, list all of Koch's postulates. (b) Based on the information provided above, do you see any problems with identifying Bobo Virus as the cause of the new Washington State disease? Why or why not? Option B: Suppose a new strain of bird flu is infecting people in Australia.  Suppose also that you're an epidemiologist who is interested in determining which risk factors increase the likelihood that someone will become infected with Australian bird flu.  Describe a prospective study you could perform to determine the risk factors.  As part of your answer, discuss which control group you'd use, and what you'd look for in the control group.  Also discuss what results you'd look for to indicate that a presumed risk factor does indeed increase the likelihood of acquiring Australian flu.

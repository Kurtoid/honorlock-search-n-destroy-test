Background Imagine you manage a team of salespeople. For every sale, a salesperson earns a percentage of the total sale as a commission. There may also be fees associated with a sale that go to the salesperson. A salesperson's total earnings for a given sale are the sum of the commission and the fees. You have a CSV file with the following columns:  Transaction_id (an identifier representing one sale, an integer) Year (the year in which the transaction occurred, an integer) Salesperson (the name of a salesperson, a string) Commission (the commission earned by the salesperson for this sale, a float) Fees (the fees earned by the salesperson for this sale, a float)  Your CSV file contains data from 2015 to the present. Instructions Write a function that takes one argument, a string containing a path to a CSV file like the one described above. Your function should return a Pandas Series object containing the average (mean) total earnings per salesperson for all sales in 2020 only. You can assume Pandas was imported as pd. For full credit, your solution should not use any loops. You may not use any module other than Pandas.

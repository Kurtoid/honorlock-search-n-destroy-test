Considering still the elastic solid, you may generate state variables from the energy, temperature, entropy, stress and strain. Recalling that we say something is a natural function of other variables when its infinitesimal is described as a linear combination of infinitesimals of those variables, give (you don't need to name them, just give the algebraic expressions) state variables that are natural variables of i) temperature and strain, ii) entropy and stress and iii) entropy and strain. Make sure to indicate which is which.

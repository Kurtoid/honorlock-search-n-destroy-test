Calculate the following pH, [OH-], and/or [H3O+ ] given the following information below. Place all numbers for [H3O+] and [OH-]in proper scientific notation. The scientific notation is broken down by significant digits (first box) and exponents ( x 10^) in separate boxes. Remember the rule for significant figures and logarithms. They will be enforced on this problem (i.e. - if your answer is correct but significant figures are wrong, you may only get partial credit which will be awarded after the instructor reviews your answer).    A pH = 3.350 [H3O+]= [A] x 10^[B] [OH-] = [C] x 10^[D]   B pH = 7.6231 [H3O+]= [E]  x 10^[F] [OH-] = [G] x 10^[H]   C pH = 9.91 [H3O+]= [I] x 10^[J] [OH-] =  [K] x 10^[L]   D pH = [M] [H3O+] =  5.234 x 10-4 pOH =  [N]   E pH = [O] [H3O+] =  5.4 x 10-8 pOH =  [P]   F pH = [Q] [H3O+] =  4 x 10-12 pOH =  [R]
The current price of oil is $50 a barrel.  Assume I can buy oil and store it in an oil tanker for a total storage three month storage cost of $2 per barrel.  The storage costs include all costs associated with transport and insurance of oil.   There is a 3 month T-bill that guarantees a return for 3 months.  The price of the T-bill is $990.099 and pays $1000 in 3 months.  So, the guaranteed return = 1% over 3 months, since (1 + Rf) = (1.01) = 1000/990.099. What would be the highest possible forward price (in dollars) for delivery of a barrel of oil in 3 months that insures there is no arbitrage incentive to sell T-bills, buy oil, store the oil, and agree to deliver the oil in three months at the forward price. Just answer in number of dollars and cents  (example;  if answer was $80.25, put in 80.25)

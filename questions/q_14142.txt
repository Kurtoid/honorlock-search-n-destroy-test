You can borrow/invest at most $1,000,000 or the equivalent euro amount, i.e., EUR952,381. Design an arbitrage trading strategy using the concept of covered interest arbitrage. How would you start implementing the arbitrage trading strategy? Would your first transaction be to borrow in USD (and then invest in the other currency) or to invest in USD (and to borrow in the other currency)? Assume you are a dollar based investor.

Hint 2: We know from covered Interest Rate Parity (IRP) that: FUSD/EUR / SUSD/EUR = (1+rUSD) / (1+rEUR)

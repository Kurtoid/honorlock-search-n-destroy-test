If a jury finds that Frank's services were below the standard of care, all three plaintiffs can recover because they were all harmed by Frank's actions. C. If a jury finds that Frank's services were below the standard of care, only Cleo and Eleanor can recover because Frank did not have a duty to Hank. D.

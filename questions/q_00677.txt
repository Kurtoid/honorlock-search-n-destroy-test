Woodworth & Baines is a retail chain that has taken up numerous measures to improve employee attitude, motivation, and organizational performance. New training programs, employee engagement initiatives, and an employee welfare council were the three main strategies implemented as part of the employee empowerment program. Norman Kilner was one of twenty employees nominated to the employee welfare council where they were required to interact with the management to promote the interests of the employees. Additionally, the job roles of these twenty employees were vertically enhanced to give them more autonomy in the organization. However, six months into the employee empowerment program, a survey by HR revealed no actual change in employee attitudes. Similarly, a survey conducted by the production manager revealed that work productivity had not increased by any substantial measure either. Which of the following, if true, would best explain this outcome?

As a promising ACG 5815 student at the University of Florida, you face many exciting possibilities for your future (GO GATORS!).  One exciting possibility is setting up a Florida CPA firm of your own.  Yes, with your rigorous accounting knowledge and business acumen, you could be your own boss one day!  But, there are so many things to think about before you start measuring the drapes for your executive suite. Note: For the purposes of the case, assume you have the same best friend for each question and you only have one best friend.    First things first, you need to get your CPA license. In order to get your license, how many total semester hours of college education are required (assume you have already passed all 4 parts of the CPA exam)?  a) The AICPA Code of Professional Conduct  i.

The Florida Statutes & Rulesiii. The Code and FL Statutes & Rules are "fairly equal" in scope    Next, you need to pick out a name for your future CPA firm. You and your best friend are thinking about creating a partnership (assume you will both receive your CPA licenses on the exact same day many years before opening your CPA firm).  Your best friend is really creative and proposes the name "Accountants & Company, CPAs" - is this an acceptable CPA firm name?   a) The AICPA Code of Professional Conduct  i. Conclusion:ii.

The Florida Statutes & Rulesiii. The Code and FL Statutes & Rules are "fairly equal" in scope    Next, you will need to attract clients so you need to think about how you will advertise. Your best friend (again, who is really creative) thinks that advertising that you are both specialists would cause new clients to start lining up at the door eager to purchase your accounting services.  You are both planning on gaining some work experience prior to starting out on your own, so your best friend thinks advertising you are specialists would be appropriate - would it be appropriate?    a) The AICPA Code of Professional Conduct  i.

The Florida Statutes & Rulesiii. The Code and FL Statutes & Rules are "fairly equal" in scope    Next, you need to figure out whether you can accept First Gator Bank as your first client (you are good friends with the management at First Gator Bank and they always have said they would switch to your CPA firm for their annual audit if you ever went out on your own). A potential problem though is that your best friend's mom is the CFO at First Gator Bank.  Would this create an independence issue for your CPA firm if you accepted First Gator Bank as a client?  a) The AICPA Code of Professional Conduct  i. Conclusion:ii. Citation:iii.

The Florida Statutes & Rulesiii. The Code and FL Statutes & Rules are "fairly equal" in scope    Next, you will need some cash for when you first start out, so you need to figure out how to get some financing. The bad news is your best friend is afraid of debt and says you will need to personally own all the debt taken on by the firm (what are best friend for, right?).  The good news is that you already have a really great relationship with a bank - First Gator Bank!  If everything goes to plan and First Gator Bank becomes your first client [assume any independence issue noted in Question 4 was magically resolved (if there was an independence issue)], would there be any issues with you taking out a really big (up to 85% of your net worth) unsecured personal loan from First Gator Bank?     a) The AICPA Code of Professional Conduct  i.

The Code and FL Statutes & Rules are "fairly equal" in scope    Next, you need to figure out how you and your best friend would update your Instagram accounts after you get your second client, Gator Company (an SEC registrant that sells and repairs vintage UF handbags). With Gator Company as your financial statement audit client, you expect that you will get confidential information about upcoming vintage handbag releases months before the public.  Your best friend loves posting on Instagram about the latest news - would it be an issue if your best friend posts about Gator Company's new releases before they are announced to the public?  a) The AICPA Code of Professional Conduct i.

The Florida Statutes & Rulesiii. The Code and FL Statutes & Rules are "fairly equal" in scope    Next, your favorite cousin will plan to start a separate CPA firm in the same city as your CPA firm, so you need to figure out how your two CPA firms could co-exist. Your cousin thinks it will be easy - you can just swap audit clients every other year.  He says that the even better part is that you can collect a referral fee each time you refer your audit clients to his CPA firm.  At this point, any type of fee sounds nice, but you want to make sure it is ok - would you be allowed to collect referral fees for recommending the audit services of your cousin's CPA firm?  a) The AICPA Code of Professional Conduct  i.

Your best friend says peer reviews might take a lot of work so you should triple check before even thinking about signing up - would you need to be enrolled?  a) The AICPA Code of Professional Conduct  i.

Specifically, it has always been your dream to assist Gator Company management in its assessment of its business risk control processes.  Would you be able to fulfill this dream with your CPA firm?  Your best friend notes that you may want to check your insurance policy first.  a) The AICPA Code of Professional Conduct  i. Conclusion:ii. Citation:iii.

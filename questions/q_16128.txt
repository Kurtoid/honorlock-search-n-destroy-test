You are hired as an ergonomist at Acme Inc. While doing a plant walk, you come across an assembly station worked by a short woman and you see her struggling to keep up. Upon asking, she complains that:  The desk is too high which is causing her some pain in both the shoulders. She is having difficulty in reaching the overhead impact driver. Her wrist hurts while putting in the 'C' clip. This 'C' clip is put in place by a straight plier.    How would you solve this problem?    After coming up with the solution, provide a justification for the investment required.  (Hint: This is similar to the "chair" example given by Dr. Thomas in class)   Constraints:  Transferring her to another job is not feasible as it will take a lot of resources to train her You have a limited budget (Think less than $2000) A stool/elevated platform cannot be used as there is a risk of her losing balance and falling.

Operative Report  Preoperative Diagnosis: Osteomyelitis, fifth metatarsal, left Postoperative Diagnosis: Same Procedure: Amputation of toe The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position. After adequate general anesthesia was obtained, the left foot was scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual manner. No tourniquet was utilized. A skin incision was made along the lateral border of the fifth metatarsal and carried down to the subcutaneous tissue in line with the skin incision. Bleeders were clamped and electrocoagulated. Dissection was carried down to the base of the fifth metatarsal, where an osteotomy was made at the base. The bone was then delivered from the wound and sent to the pathology department. There was erosion of the head of the fifth metatarsal consistent with osteomyelitis. The toe was amputated, and the entire specimen was sent to the pathology department. All of the tissues were debrided. The wound was irrigated and hemostasis assured. The subcutaneous tissue was very loosely reapproximated utilizing 4-0 Vicryl suture. The skin was not closed and was allowed to drain. A sterile dressing was applied to the wound. The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

On Friday, July 3, 2009, a fireworks show was held at a theme park in Florida. The fireworks show had been going on for about 10-years. The fireworks show was always a crowd favorite and crowds would frequently exceed 25,000. In an effort to better accommodate the guests, the park decided to build a wooden bridge across a lake. The bridge was approximately 1,200 feet in length and 15 feet in width. It was a very well-built bridge and had passed numerous inspections. The fireworks company had remained the same over the last 10-years. They started setting-up on Thursday afternoon. They set-up the same way they had set-up in the previous years. They primarily utilized barges to launch the bulk of the fireworks. Some smaller fireworks were launched from the shoreline opposite the crowd. The fireworks display started at around 9:15 pm. The crowds were located throughout the park and on the bridge, standing and seated on railings, benches, etc. About halfway through the show fireworks debris started to reach the guests on the center portion of the bridge. It was estimated that 15 people received burns requiring medical attention. Shortly after, a few guests noticed that a portion of the bridge was on fire. It caused a panic and a mad rush ensued. The majority of the guests started heading to the east side of the shoreline. This caused trampling. A total of 10 people had to be hospitalized for injuries. 10 of the burn victims were treated on scene and released. The other 5 were treated at an area hospital and released.  Please identify the fireworks standards that exist regarding the handling and display of fireworks in front of a live audience.  Considering an audience of 25,000, how many trained crowd managers should have been available to assist with crowd-related considerations.  Please describe a method that could have prevented patrons' from being injured as a result of firework debris.  Please describe the purpose of a trained crowd manager and how they could have assisted with the evacuation from the bridge.  Would the bridge and/or immediate outdoor viewing area be considered a "Special Amusement Building?" Please explain why/why not.

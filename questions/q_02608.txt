Do people blink more when looking at an LED screen? The blink rates of eight subjects were tested twice in one minute intervals and the blinks per minute were recorded. For the first test, the subjects sat relaxed in a neutral colored room with no visual stimulation. For the second test, the subjects were given a mobile device with an LED screen. Test whether the blink rates are different when looking at an LED screen at the 0.05 level of significance. (Assume the testing requirements have been met.)

Show work on your paper and submit on the last problem of this test.                                             g(x) = x3 -  2x2 - 11x + 52 Find all zeros of the polynomial (give exact values - no decimals). Show work if synthetic division was needed. List multiple zeros in each of the categories: rational first, irrational and complex. If there are none in any of these three categories, write "none" in all lower case.a) rational zeros (least to greatest with commas and no spaces): [x] b) irrational zeros (list negative before positive and use sqrt to designate square root symbol. Put commas between with no spaces.  Example: 2-sqrt(3),2+sqrt(3) ):    [y] c) complex zeros (List complex conjugates separately using "i" and listing the one with a negative imaginary part first and then the other that has a positive imaginary part.  Example: 1-5i,1+5i ): [z]d) on your work paper, write g(x) as a product of linear factors.

Cover Letters. The cover letter responds to this ad:  "CAM Technician to work with other technicians and manage some GIS and mapping projects. Also perform updating of the GIS database. Experience required."    530 Maplegrove Bozeman, Montana 59715 November 11, 2016 Mr. Bruce Hedley Adecco Technical 243 Balord Ct. Bozeman, Montana 59715   Dear Bruce   I am writing you in response to your ad on Monsterjobs.com. Would you please consider me for the position of CAM technician? I believe that my academic schooling at Montana State University, along with my work experience would make me an excellent candidate for the position. While at Montana State University, I took one class in particular that applies well to this job. It was a CAD drafting class, which I received a 97% in. The next semester I was a Teachers Aid for that same class, where I was responsible for answering questions about drafting from my peers. This gave me a much stronger grasp on all aspects of CAD work than I could have ever gotten from simply taking the class. While there is no technical aspects of either positions I have held, I believe that my experience there will shed light on my work ethic and interpersonal skills. I started out as a graveyard shift janitor, with no previous experience. All of my coworkers were at least thirty years older than me, and had a minimum of five years of janitorial experience. However after working there for only one year I was promoted to assistant manager. I liked the work that I did, but the manager did not seem to value my skills at first. One day he told me I could be more productive by stacking freight by bending my knees first which I already knew. Sometimes you get into to a groove and forget the fundamentals. Anyway, three months after I received this position, I was informed that my job was going to contract out the janitorial work and that all of us would be losing our jobs. I decided that I wanted to stay within the company, and I was able to receive a position as head of freight. The enclosed resume provides an overview of my education and work experience. I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you at your convenience to discuss my qualifications for this position. Please write me at the above address or leave a message any time. If you would like to contact me by email, my email address is kbradley@montanastate.edu.   Sincerely,   Ken Bradley In the final body paragraph, Kenneth should include which of the following examples of contact information?

A student wants to measure the amount of HRP in their sample using a spectrophotometer. They followed all the steps in the protocol including completing 2 ml washes with PBS-BSA, then adding 1000 uL of Triton-X to their cell plate sample, and afterward adding 700 uL of substrate into a new Eppendorf tube. To this new Eppendorf tube that will be used to quantify the amount of HRP, they then added 20 uL of their sample and later stopped the reaction with 400 uL of H2SO4. What would you use to create the blank before putting your sample into the spectrophotometer?

In class, we started looking at the thiele modulus, which is a non-dimensional variable that explains internal transport effects in heterogeneous catalysts. We learned that when the thiele modulus is high, this effectiveness factor is low. From the graph below, which concentration profile correspond to a slow reaction?

A respiratory care practitioner is called stat to evaluate a patient who is being mechanically ventilated.  Auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing and the patient is agitated and diaphoretic. A quick check of the ventilator reveals the following:   The ventilator settings are: mode-SIMV, VT-700ml, flow rate-50L/min, ventilator frequency-8 breaths/minute   The peak pressure is reaching 45 cm H2O and the high pressure limit alarm is sounding with each machine breath   Patient's total respiratory rate is 32/minute. The measured returned tidal volume from the mandated breaths varies from 200 to 300 ml.   These findings indicate that the:    The ventilator is pressure cycling There is a large leak in the ventilator circuit The tidal volume which is being delivered by the ventilator has been changed to 200ml

The 104.5deg bond angle in the water molecule is the result of the [1] of electron orbitals around oxygen.   The polarity of the O-H bond is caused by the [2] of oxygen relative to that of hydrogen.   Octane molecules dispersed in water tend to aggregate because that allows water molecules to be more [3].   The insolubility of nonpolar molecules in water is due to the large [4], which is the result of water molecules forming an ordered network surrounding nonpolar molecules.   A solution containing a weak acid (pK = 7.5) and its conjugate base at pH of 8.5 has a good capacity to buffer the addition of [5].

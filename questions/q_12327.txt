Drougas Enterprises had $325,000 in cash on the balance sheet at the beginning of the year.  At year-end, the company had $275,000 in cash.  We know cash flow from operating activities totaled $675,000, and cash flow from long-term investing activities totaled -$1,135,000.

Figure 4(a) shows a setup to measure the power consumption of an inverter with 3 current meters. Figure 4(b) shows the input waveform of the inverter. Answer the following questions:      (a) To measure Psc (short-circuit power) at point A of the input waveform, which meter must be used? (b) To measure Psc at point D of the input waveform, which meter must be used? (c) To measure Pdyn (dynamic power) at point A of the input waveform, which meter must be used? (d) To measure Pdyn (dynamic power) at point D of the input waveform, which meter must be used? You have to consider whether a meter is requited in this question. (e) Will meters M1 and M2 measure the same current at point B? (f) What is the power measured in question (e)? (g) What is the meter value of M3 read at point B? (h) Give the reason why Pdyn =  1/2  E(sw)CVdd2 f contains a factor of  1/2 . Just use a very simple example to explain.

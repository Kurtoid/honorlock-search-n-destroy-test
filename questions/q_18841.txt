________developed a highly successful system for classifying living organisms that placed every species within a nested series of hierarchically-arranged categories. Although he did not understand the reason why this pattern existed in nature, biologists would later explain this as evidence that all contemporary organisms are descended from a common ancestor.   A _______ is any species on the lineage leading to modern humans after the split from the common ancestor that humans share with chimpanzees.    _______tools (first found at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania by Louis and Mary Leakey) provide some of the earliest evidence of the modification of stone to produce a cutting edge. Among modern animals, only humans shape stone into a cutting tool, making ______ stone tools an early part of the hominin archaeological record.  [Note same term is used in both blanks].    Beginning about 1.7 million years ago, the ________stone tools used by later Homo erectus ergaster show more standardization and more specialization of function than the earlier stone tool traditions. The maker of these tools took more steps to achieve the final shape and had a clear concept of the shape that should emerge from his/her efforts.    The narrow waist of Turkana boy (about 1.6 Mya) suggests a short gut similar to that seen in modern humans (which is associated with the consumption of nutrient dense foods). In contrast, 3.2 million-year-old _______from Hadar had a flaring ribcage and a protruding stomach similar to that seen in modern chimpanzees and gorillas. This is associated with eating large quantities of plant foods.    Selam, the 3.3 million year old child from Dikika, Ethiopia adds new support to the idea that Australopithecus afarensis was adapted to life in the _______ (as well as life on the ground). Her scapula (the bone on the back) resembles that of a modern gorilla and suggests that suspension was important in her everyday life.    The birth canal of Homo erectuswould have restricted birth to an infant with only ______% of the brain size of adults.  This means that most brain growth took place after birth as it does in modern humans.  It suggests that Homo erectus infants were as helpless as the infants of modern humans and would have required extensive, sensitive parental care.   In their 2004 Nature article, Bramble & Lieberman have suggested that the anatomical basis for endurance _________, such as the balanced, central position of the foramen magnum, first emerged in Turkana boy's species Homo erectus ergaster. These authors conclude that ________ prey to exhaustion may have become a critical foraging strategy.  [Note same term is used in both blanks]   According to a 2000 paper by _________, human skin pigmentation is a very labile trait that is influenced by competing selective pressures. These include the destructive effects of UV radiation on body stores of folate (with dark skin emerging to protect folate stores) and the need to produce adequate amounts of Vitamin D (with light skin emerging in regions of low solar radiation to facilitate Vitamin D synthesis).  __________conclude that skin color is a very labile trait that changes easily (over evolutionary time).  Some lineages of humans may have gone through alternating periods of depigmentation and pigmentation as they moved from one UV zone to another.  [The same answer is used in both blanks].    ________is behavior which is acquired by learning from other members of the group.  In humans, the mental infrastructure for the observable behavior includes a system of shared meanings that guide perception and action.  Only humans perceive a difference between ordinary water and holy water.  Only humans behave differently toward ordinary water and holy water.

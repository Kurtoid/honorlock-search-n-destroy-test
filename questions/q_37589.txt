BONUS POINTS: Calculate the mass of water (in g) that can be vaporized at its boiling point with 155 kJ of heat. SORT   You are given a certain amount of heat in kilojoules and asked to find the mass of water that can be vaporized. GIVEN 155 Kj  FIND   g H2O STRATEGIZE   The heat of vaporization gives the relationship between heat absorbed and moles of water vaporized. Begin with the given amount of heat (in kJ) and convert to moles of water that can be vaporized. Use the molar mass as a conversion factor to convert from moles of water to mass of water. RELATIONSHIPS USEDDHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol (at 100 degC)18.02 g H2O = 1 mol H2O ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perform the following hypothesis test: An article in the San Jose Mercury News stated that students in the California state university system take 4.5 years, on average, to finish their undergraduate degrees. Suppose you believe that the mean time is longer. You conduct a survey of 49 students and obtain a sample mean of 5.1 with a sample standard deviation of 1.2. Do the data support your claim at the 1% level? (You may assume that the underlying population is normally distributed.)   Is this a test of one mean or proportion? [a1] State the claim in mathematical form. [a2] (This is the [a16] hypothesis.) Identify the null and alternative hypothesis. H0: [a3] HA: [a4] We will use the [a5] distribution because the population standard deviation is [a6]. Is this a left, right, or two-tailed test? Pick the matching graph. [a15] A. B. C. State the significance level. a = [a8] Calculate the p-value using technology. p-value = [a7] Compare the p-value to the significance level. p-value [a9] a, meaning that we will [a10] the H0. Therefore, because we [a11] the H0  and the original claim was the [a12], we find that there [a13] sufficient evidence to [a14] of the claim that students in the California state university system take longer than 4.5 years to graduate.

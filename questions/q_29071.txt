A uniform solid cylinder of mass 10 kg can rotate about a frictionless axle through its center O, as shown in the cross-sectional view in the figure.  A rope wrapped around the outer radius R1 = 1.0 m exerts a force of magnitude F1 = 5.0 N to the right.  A second rope wrapped around another section of radius R2 = 0.50 m exerts a force of magnitude F2 = 6.0 N downward. How many radians does the cylinder rotate through in the first 5.0 seconds, if it starts from rest?  (b)  What distance does a point on the outer edge of R1 travel during the first 5 seconds? (c) What is the tangential acceleration of the rope wrap around R2.

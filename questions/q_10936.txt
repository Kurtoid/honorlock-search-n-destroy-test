The current price of oil is $50 a barrel.  Assume I can buy oil and store it in an oil tanker for a total three month storage cost of $2 per barrel (or 4% of the value of a barrel of oil).  The storage costs include all costs associated with transport and insurance of oil.   There is a 3 month T-bill that guarantees a return for 0.25 years.  The price of the T-bill is $990.099 and pays $1000 in 0.25 years.  So, the guaranteed risk-free return = 1% over 0.25 years, since (1 + Rf) = (1.01) = 1000/990.099. What would be the highest possible forward price, F0.25, (in dollars) for delivery of a barrel of oil in 0.25 years that insures there is no arbitrage incentive to sell T-bills and use the money to buy oil, store the oil, and agree to deliver the oil in three months at the forward price, F0.25. Just answer in number of dollars and cents  (example;  if answer is $80.25, put in 80.25) Hint: This is just the no arbitrage forward price where convenience yield for oil = 0

It must not be (it is not possible it should be in truth) a conversion of people to the worship of the Lord Jesus by force of arms and swords of steel. So indeed did Nebuchadnezzar deal with all the world; Dan. 3. So doth his antitype and  successor the beast deal with all the Earth; Rev. 13&c. But so did never the Lord Jesus bring unto his more pure worship, for he abhors (as all men, yea, the very Indians do) an unwilling spouse, and to enter into a forced bed: The will in worship, if true, is like a free vote. . .  Jesus Christ compels by the mighty persuasions of his messengers to come in, but otherwise with earthly weapons he never did compel nor can be compelled. The not discerning of this truth hath let out the blood of thousands in civil combustions in all ages; and...the earth drunk with the blood of saints, and witnesses of Jesus. Who is this author?

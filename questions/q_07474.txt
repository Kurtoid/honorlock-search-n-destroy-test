Question 2 You have been hired to analyze the performance of the athletes participating in a regional sprint triathlon. For this initial analysis, the events are considered in pairs, and you are starting with running and swimming.  Each swimmer is given a score based on their times, where a higher score indicates a better performance (or lower completion time). The joint pmf of the scores for running and swimming is given below.     Swimming/Running   3   6   9   12         5   0.10   0.15   0.05   0.05         10   0.05   0.05   0.20   0.05         15   0.03   0.07   0.10   0.10                                     c) What is the correlation between swimming and running scores? Some intermediate values have been computed for you and are provided here. Enter your answer with 4 decimal places. You must show your work/setup on the template submitted to gradescope to receive full credit for a correct answer. E[Swimming^2] = 109                     E[Running] = 7.68 Var(Swimming) = 16.84                  Var(Running) = 9.42

Suppose you observe the price of the following bonds today (t=0). Assume that the face value of each bond is $100 and coupons are paid semiannually.  Bond A: 6-month zero coupon bond priced at $96.70 Bond B: 1-year bond with 4.00% coupon priced at $97.90 Bond C: 1.5-year bond with 8.00% coupon priced at $102.20   (a) Compute the discount curve Z(0,T) for T = 6 month, 1-year, and 1.5-year.   Z(0,0.5) = [answer1]  Z(0,1) = [answer2]  Z(0,1.5) = [answer3]   (b) Once you get the discount curve Z(0,T), you take another look at the data and find the following 1-year bonds Bond D: 1-year bond with 8.00% coupon priced at $101.72 Bond E: 1-year bond with 10.00% coupon priced at $106.12 Compute the fair values for these bonds with the discounts you found.  Are the fair values the same as the market (traded) prices above? Bond D: [answer4] Bond E: [answer5]   (c) Is there an arbitrage opportunity in part (b)? If there is an arbitrage opportunity, describe how you can take advantage of it. Assume that Bond A and B are correctly priced and you can buy and short any fraction of those bonds.  (Step 1) You [answer6] [answer7]-units of Bond A (Step 2) You [answer8] [answer9]-units of Bond B (Step 3) You [answer10] 1-unit of Bond [answer11]

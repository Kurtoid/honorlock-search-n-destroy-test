All of the following are symptoms of trauma from occlusion EXCEPT which one?
Calculate the energy of a photon in the Balmer series that results from the transition n=4 to n=2.
A novel actin-binding protein (X) is overexpressed in certain highly malignant cancers. You wish to determine if protein X caps actin filaments at the (+) end. You incubate an excess of protein X with various concentrations of G-actin under conditions that induce polymerization. Control samples are incubated in the absence of protein X. The results are shown in the figure. How can you conclude from these data that protein X binds to the (+) end of actin filaments?

The client had an endoscopic procedure performed and esophageal varices were sclerosed during the procedure.  The client experienced a small pneumothorax which was not treated with a chest tube.  The next day, the client experienced confusion and irritability.  Vital signs are temperature 100o F, pulse 104 beats/minute and regular, respirations 34 breaths/minute and labored, and blood pressure 166/76 mm Hg.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is an important thermoplastic polymer used for many applications, such as soda/water bottles. PET does not crystallize easily, so soda bottles are usually transparent even though the polymer has some crystallinity; but this is because the crystallites are nanosized and too small to scatter light. The following DSC thermograms were measured for samples of PET that were annealed for various times.           - Which direction is exothermic, up or down? [1]   - Was the sample shown in thermogram (a) more or less crystalline than the samples shown in the thermograms of (b)? [2] - Which of these processing treatments would be best for keeping the fizz in these bottles (i.e., helping to reduce gas diffusion out)? Fill in blank from choice of A thru D: [3]    (A) quenched sample shown in the top thermogram of (a)      (B) crystallized/annealed at 383K for 1 hour (thermogram in (b))    (C) crystallized/annealed at 383K for 2 hour (thermogram in (b))    (D) crystallized/annealed at 383K for 5 hour (thermogram in (b)) - The Tc peaks, which are (endothermic / exothermic) [4], seem to occur over a broad range of temperatures, as compared to the Tm peak. This is because this Tc arises from a (hot / cold) [5] crystallization process that occurs as the temperature is ramped up during the DSC scan, in contrast to Tc's that are normally measured as a melt is cooled down to crystallize. The rising temperature provides mobility such that the chains can try to organize into their lower energy conformations, which in this case would be (random coils / liquid crystals / lamellar crystallites) [6]. In both cases of Tc measurement, the Tc temperature is not a material property, as is the Tm, but simply depends on the temperature and kinetics of the phase transformation.

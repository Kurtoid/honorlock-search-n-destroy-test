A positive point charge q1{"version":"1.1","math":"q1"} creates an electric field of magnitude E1{"version":"1.1","math":"E1"} at a spot located at a distance r1{"version":"1.1","math":"r1"} from the charge. The charge is replaced by another positive point charge q2{"version":"1.1","math":"q2"}, which creates a field of magnitude E2=E1{"version":"1.1","math":"E2=E1"} at a distance of r2=2r1{"version":"1.1","math":"r2=2r1"}. How is q2{"version":"1.1","math":"q2"} related to q1{"version":"1.1","math":"q1"}?

Part II - Short Answer:  Total 30 points, 5 points per question.  Answer 6 of the questions below (there are six boxes below for each answer):  Suppose the government in response to angry voters during the summer imposes a price ceiling on cold beverages of $1.00 per can.  However, the market price is $2.00 per can.  What would you expect the outcome to be?  In the short run, under what conditions should a firm produce if its price is below average total cost? What are the conditions that it should not produce?  Explain your reasoning. Describe the law of diminishing marginal returns (product). How does that relate to cost?   How would a firm seeking to maximize profits price its services. Is there a difference between this for a competitive and monopoly market? (Consider marginal revenue and price) What is the relationship between wages and the value of marginal product? Explain positive and negative externalities. A public good is non-rival and non-excludable. Define these terms and discuss how this could be considered a market failure. Ford Motor Company made headlines in 1914 by offering autoworkers $5 per day, up from $2.50 per day. The wage payment was newsworthy because the typical market wage in manufacturing at that time was just $2 to $3 per day. What was Ford's rationale for offering a higher-than-competitive wage and how did he believe that this would improve his business. (Hint - think about value marginal product)

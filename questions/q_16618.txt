Consuela owns a catamaran that she purchased five years ago for $100,000.  When cruise ships visit her city she does snorkeling trips for the tourists.  It is being depreciated straight-line over its 10-year expected life and is currently worth $35,000.  It is expected to have no value at the end of its life in five years.  She is considering moving to a larger boat that can accommodate more people.  She has found a deal on a nice used boat for $125,000.  The new boat would be depreciated straight-line over its five year life.  Consuela expects that revenues would increase by $50,000 per year, but she will have to hire more crew to work with the drunken tourists and use more fuel, so expenses will increase by an expected $12,500.  She expects that the new boat would actually be worth $20,000 in five years.  Consuela's marginal tax rate is 30% and her required rate of return is 15%.  Should she replace her boat?

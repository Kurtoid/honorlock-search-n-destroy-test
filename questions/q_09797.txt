Individuals of a particular species of ground beetle are either light tan or dark brown. Light-tan beetles are predominant in habitats with light-colored sandy soils, and dark brown beetles are predominant in habitats with dark-colored loam soils. In an experiment designed to determine the survival rates of light-tan beetles and dark brown beetles in different habitats, 500 light-tan beetles and 500 dark-brown beetles were released in each of four habitats. Each beetle had been marked with a small spot of red paint on the underside of its abdomen before it was released. One week after the beetles had been released, any marked beetles that could be found were recaptured. The results are presented in the table below. It is assumed that differences in the numbers of beetles recaptured are directly related to differences in survival rates. If all insectivorous birds and remaining beetles were removed from habitat 2 and 500 additional dark-brown beetles and 500 additional light-tan beetles were then released into habitat 2, which of the following is the best estimate of the number of additional dark brown beetles that would be expected to be recaptured in habitat 2 after one more week?

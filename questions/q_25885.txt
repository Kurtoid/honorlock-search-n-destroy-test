DrrA is thought to interact with rab1.  The gel below shows the results from a co-immunoprecipitation experiment involving various GST-tagged rab proteins mixed with DrrA.  The rab proteins are listed at the top of the gel, including mutant rab1 proteins locked in either the GDP- or GTP-bound form.  A GST antibody was used for the co-immunoprecipitation.  A protein stain was used to visualize proteins in the top gel; a Western blot against DrrA was used to visualize proteins in the bottom gel. (i) Why was GST alone (far right lane) used for one of the co-immunoprecipitation conditions?  (ii)  Why were GST-tagged variants of rab 5 and rab7 used for this experiment?  (iii)  DrrA can be detected by protein stain, so why was a Western blot also run?

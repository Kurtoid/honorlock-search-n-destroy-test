Mrs. Pearson brings her cat, Puff, to the clinic. Puff has been anorexic and lethargic for a few days. For several weeks, Mrs. Pearson has noticed that Puff has times when he is short of breath. Also, Mrs. Pearson tells you that for over a year, she has been making food for Puff because of all the pet food recalls. You do your physical exam and take a radiograph, and the vet and you conclude that Puff has Dilated Cardiomyopathy. Based off what you know about this condition in cats, what is Puff 's homemade diet lacking that could have led to this problem?
There are two questions remaining on this exam, but you can choose which one you will answer. Your options for which question to answer are shown below. Read these questions, then take mental note of which one you prefer to answer: Option A: Suppose that a new disease has swept across Washington state. Those who are infected with this disease develop lesions on the skin. Many scientists suspect that the new disease is caused by a pathogen called Bobo Virus. Scientists have found that this virus is relatively easy to grow in the laboratory using cell culture. There is also a nice animal model for studying the pathogenic effects of this virus (Bobo Virus causes the same symptoms in mice as they do in humans). Through their work, scientists have found that Bobo Virus causes respiratory illness (instead of skin lesions) in 3% of the animals infected. (a) In correct order, list all of Koch's postulates. (b) Based on the information provided above, do you see any problems with identifying Bobo Virus as the cause of the new Washington State disease? Why or why not? Option B: Suppose a new strain of bird flu is infecting people in Australia.  Suppose also that you're an epidemiologist who is interested in determining which risk factors increase the likelihood that someone will become infected with Australian bird flu.  Describe a retrospective study you could perform to determine the risk factors.  As part of your answer, discuss which control group you'd use, and what you'd look for in the control group.  Also discuss what results you'd look for to indicate that a presumed risk factor does indeed increase the likelihood of acquiring Australian flu.

Use this copy of the HONORLOCK ROOM SCAN INSTRUCTIONS to answer the below questions Room Scan Instructions for Honorlock Proctoring The purpose of the room scan is to insure that the same testing environment requirements for an on-campus Test or Exam are being met at the student testing location.   The room must be well lit, the speed of the camera movement must be slow enough, and the video quality must be high enough so that the instructor can clearly identify what is in the room and what is on or under the desk or table at which the test will be taken on The scan must show the entire room as well as the entire desk or table at which the test or exam will be taken  Students are advised to view the How to Conduct a Proper Room Scan video from Honorlock for a visual explanation of a proper room scan. Students will have an opportunity to practice this and receive instructor feedback during the Orientation and Honorlock Quiz (O&HL Quiz). When the instructor reviews a student's room scan for a proctoring session they must be able to confirm that:  No other persons are in the room No notes or other course related materials are on the walls or within reaching distance of the desk or table at which the test or exam will be taken The desk or table on which the Test or Exam will be taken is free of prohibited items specified in the Honorlock Standard Testing Guidelines. These would include, but are not limited to, books, paper, cellphones or telephones, other computers including iPads and similar devices, extra monitors (on or off), televisions, cameras other than the room scan camera, headphones, printers, boxes  If the instructor cannot confirm that these requirements have been met then the Test or Exam score will be invalidated (grade of zero points).

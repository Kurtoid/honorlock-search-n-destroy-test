Read the excerpt below and answer the question: Colleges have a serious problem with alcohol abuse among students, and it's not getting any better.... Binge drinking--defined as the heavy, episodic use of alcohol--has persisted on campuses despite both a general decrease in alcohol consumption among Americans and an increase in the number of abstainers. Some people (including the author of a recent front-page article in the New York Times) have assumed that the latter two trends have translated into more moderate drinking on the campuses.

Our study found that 44 percent of all students in the sample were binge drinkers--50 percent of the men and 39 percent of the women.   In this passage, the authors establish the credibility of their findings by providing:

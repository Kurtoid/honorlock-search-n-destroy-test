Assume a number of branch prediction schemes have the same number of entries. Describe the difference between a 1-bit predictor and a 2-bit predictor.  Explain why a 2-bit branch predictor often has fewer branch mispredictions than a 1-bit branch predictor. Describe the difference between a correlating (global) branch predictor and a noncorrelating (local) branch predictor.  Explain why a correlating branch predictor often has fewer branch mispredictions than a noncorrelating branch predictor. Describe the difference between a tournament (local and global) predictor and a global predictor.  Explain why a tournament branch predictor often has fewer branch mispredictions than a global branch predictor. Describe the difference between a tagged hybrid predictor and a conventional tournament (local and global) predictor. Explain why a tagged hybrid predictor often has fewer branch mispredictions than a conventional tournament predictor.

Below are four Focused Questions.  Pick 2 of them to answer. You'll need to enter your answers for both of them in the single text box provided.  Remember that you need only invest 3-4 detail-laden sentences into each answer.  Endeavor to cover the main topical point while recognizing any critical details that perhaps should be tackled. Question 1:  What elements in the message of Muhammad demonstrate his concern for social equity (in other words, a social safety net)? Question 2:  How would you describe the position/role of women in the early days of Islam? Besides the Qur'anic material you may bring to this answer, consider as well notable (or not) historical evidence. Question 3:  How (and why) did the major schools of Islamic shari'ah turn against personal interpretation in legal decision-making? Question 4:  What three things would you defend (hint: I want to see a bit of that defense!) as being the most significant historical events that occurred during the reigns of the Rashidun caliphs.

Design a Behavior Tree considering the following agent behavior: Link wants an apple from a nearby tree. If he successfully obtains an apple, he will eat it. Link has the following parameterized behaviors: GoTo(location), ClimbUp(object), ClimbDown(object), Take(object), Shake(object), Throw(object), Eat(object) The environment consists of a navigable space and locations including a hill and an outcropping (exposed rock surface), which are somewhat far from each other. Within the environment is an apple tree at the top of the hill, apples (possibly on the tree and/or the ground underneath tree), and small stones at the outcropping. Link can obtain apples utilizing any of the following strategies ordered from lowest to highest action cost: take apple from the ground under the tree, shake the tree, climb the tree and grabbing one, or throw a stone and hitting one to knock it down. However, these actions can fail if there is no apple within arm's reach (with Link either below or perched in the tree), the apples aren't ripe enough to fall when the tree is shaken, the tree is too difficult to climb up (e.g., tree trunk wet from rain), or the thrown stone misses. If Link is not up the tree, he will FAIL to climb down. But if he is up the tree, he can always climb down. Further, note that Link can only eat a food item or throw an object he has taken into possession, can only eat while standing on the ground, and must be near the tree to be within reach of hitting an apple with a thrown stone. Assume Link starts at some random position in the world standing on the ground. Link can only successfully GoTo() a location if he is not perched in a tree. GoTo() will return SUCCESS if Link is already at the location he is attempting to go to. Complete the Behavior Tree such that it captures the above agent strategies for obtaining and eating an apple. Be sure that the behavior tree handles failures at any point such that the next strategy can be attempted. Some nodes are already filled in. Make selections for the following nodes.

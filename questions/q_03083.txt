Macrocystis pyrifera is a species of giant marine algae found off the coast of Alaska.  The algae create large aquatic forests that provide habitats for many marine organisms.  One of the greatest enemy of these algae are sea urchins.  These herbivorous echinoderms can destroy large areas of the aquatic forests.  Fortunately, marine otters live in these areas and are predators of these spiny echinoderms. The otters are therefore essential in protecting the aquatic forests of the North Pacific.

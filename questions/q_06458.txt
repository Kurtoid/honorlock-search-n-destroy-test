A study evaluating the amount of protein and the acquired fat in McDonald's "Big Mac" was performed in a sample of 32 "Big Mac" burgers. The researchers found that the mean protein contained in the 32 burgers was 18 grams with standard deviation 13.5 grams, while the mean fat amount was 24.8 grams with a standard deviation of 16.2 grams. Assume that the Correlation Coefficient is r= 0.76.      A. Is there a linear correlation between the amount of protein and the fat at the 0.05 level of significance? Explain.   B. What percent of the change in the response variable (fat) can be explained by the linear correlation? Explain. (Hint: That is the Coefficient of Determination ).   C. Find the equation of the regression line () where y is the amount of fat and x the protein in a "Big Mac".   D. Using the model you have constructed, what amount of fat you expect to receive if your "Big Mac" contains 25 grams of protein?

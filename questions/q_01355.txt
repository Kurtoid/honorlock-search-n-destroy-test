In which kind of societies do people have the most leisure time?
Kate is an artist, who creates beautiful jewelry, and for the last several years has operated a studio (where she designs and sells her pieces) as a sole proprietorship under the name "Kate's Creations". She wants to expand her business, but does not have additional cash to invest. Several of Kate's friends believe that she can grow the business and generate large profits, if she is able to purchase more materials and hire a part-time assistant. Sarah, Mary and Lori want to become part owners of Kate's Creations, and each agrees to contribute $2,500 to expand Kate's business. Kate's friends will not be involved in the day-to-day business operations or make management decisions for the business. They also want to limit their personal liability to the amount of their investment, so they have suggested that Kate either form a limited liability company or a corporation.

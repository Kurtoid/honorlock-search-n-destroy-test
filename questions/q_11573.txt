Determine the initial volume needed to generate 2.50 L of 1.50 M HNO3 from 5.00 M HNO3 by dilution.
Temperature sensitive E. coli mutants have been used extensively to determine the roles of various factors during DNA replication because the mutant phenotype can be kept silent (allowing the bacteria to grow) and then activated at a desired time at which point the effect of individual mutations can be described.  For each protein listed below: 1) In one short sentence briefly describe the normal role of this factor during DNA replication. 2) In one short sentence then describe how you would expect the DNA to look after one round of replication if that particular factor was mutated (inactive; couldn't function).   (i.e. would replication occur, and if so, what would be abnormal about the replicated DNA)?    Please answer question 1 and 2  for each of the following proteins: a) DNA ligase b) DNA polymerase 1 c) helicase  d) single stranded DNA binding proteins

We would like to estimate the relationship between expenditure on health care and its determinants and the variables are Exphlth (Y) = aggregate expenditures on health care (in billions of dollars); Income  = aggregate personal income (in billions of dollars)  Pop = U.S. population (in millions); Seniors = percent 65 or over. For SAS questions, ignore the libname piece. Consider Model 1: LnExphlth = b0 + b1Ln_Income +e. We would like to test whether the residuals have constant variance.   Choose the correct option.

Sampson is interested in understanding the relationship between reading and empathy. To study this, she surveyed 600 individuals asking about how often they read, as well as how connecting they feel to people. She found that those who read more, are higher in empathy.

Which of the following explains the purpose of a pressure bag around the heparinized saline with an A-Line setup? I.        To keep the heparinized saline flowing through the catheter against the high pressure of blood in the arteries           II.       To keep the line/catheter free from blood clots           III.     To anticoagulate the patient's blood to prevent pulmonary emboli IV.     The pressurized IV bag keeps the heparin warm so it flows freely into the catheter placed in the patient's artery

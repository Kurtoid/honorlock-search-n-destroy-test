Problem 1 Draw the shear force and bending moment diagrams for this beam.  Use any methods or combination of methods you find appropriate, but show your work so we can properly evaluate it. Then, enter the values requested in this form. Note:  To be considered complete, your diagrams must have (1) labels for the axes and (2) the values of x, V and M at the extremes of the beam, at points where the loading changes, and where the shear or moment are maximum or minimum.  Include the slopes of the shear force and the bending moment at the start and end of regions where these functions are non-linear.    Format:  Enter values for these quantities with units. VA = [VA] VB- = [VB_minus] VB+ = [VB_plus] VC = [VC] MA = [MA] MB- = [MB_minus] MB+ = [MB_plus] MC = [MC] Maximum absolute value of V = [V_max] Maximum absolute value of M = [M_max]

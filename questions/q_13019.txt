You are studying tail length in squirrels. Short tail (S) is dominant to long tail (l). If you cross a heterozygote (Sl) with a homozygous recessive (ll) and you obtain the following offspring: 78 squirrels: 44 long tail, 34 short tail and you apply a chi-square test to determine if the trait is Mendelian or not, What is the expected value for each phenotype?  (value with 2 decimals) expected short [short] expected long [long] what would be your CALCULATED chi-square value? (value with 2 decimals) [chivalue]   With a critical chi square value of 3.84 (with one degree of freedom and p=0.05), would you conclude your trait is Mendelian? choose from the following options and paste the answer in the blank Yes, because the observed is significantly different from the expected. No, because the observed is significantly different from the expected. Yes,  because the observed is not significantly different from the expected. No, because the observed is not significantly different from the expected. [mendelian]

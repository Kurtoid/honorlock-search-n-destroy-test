(10 points) Beth Merchant is a developer who wishes to subdivide a large piece of property into small residential lots and to build affordable houses on the lots. Under federal regulations, housing is "affordable" only if it is acquired by a family whose annual income does not exceed 80% of the median income for the area. Beth plans to meet the federal requirements for affordable housing so that she can take advantage of federal tax credits. Beth's property is currently surrounded by residential neighborhoods. Many of the lots are one or more acres in size, and the houses do not meet the definition of affordable. The latest census data show that approximately 95% of the people living in these neighborhoods identify as white. When property owners find out about Beth's proposed development, a small (but vocal) group demands that the city block it. In response, the city council rezones the relevant area to include: (1) one mixed-use zone, accounting for roughly 10% of the area and permitting high-density housing, as well as commercial and industrial uses, and (2) rural zones, accounting for roughly 90% of the area and permitting new residential development with minimum lot sizes of one acre. The zoning amendments will prevent Beth from subdividing her property into smaller lots. Without the smaller lots, Beth will not be able to build affordable houses. Beth would like to challenge the city council's zoning amendments under the Fair Housing Act. What will Beth have to prove? What arguments might the city make in response? Make sure that you clearly state the relevant legal standards and identify relevant precedent as you apply the law to the facts.

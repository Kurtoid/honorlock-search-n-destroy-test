For this question, answer it on your work paper. In the box below, type "complete" when finished. Make sure to show all of your work. Below is an equation of A and B reacting together to create compound AB.   When this equation is at equilibrium, a flask contains a combination of A2 (yellow), H2 (colorless) and HI (colorless).  The value of the equilibrium constant Kc for this reaction is 25 at a temperature of 200 kelvin.   A2(g) + B2(g)  = 2AB(g)   a)  If the yellow color of the mixture fades as the temperature is raised, is the reaction forming AB exothermic or endothermic?   b) A flask is immersed in a constant-temperature bath maintained at 200 kelvin.  The flask initially contains the following:  [A2] = 0.024 M, [B2] = 0.436 M and [AB] = 0.15 M.  Will the concentration of AB increase or decrease as equilibrium is established?   c) What is the value of Kc for the following reaction conducted at 200 kelvin?   AB(g)  =  1/2  A2(g) +  1/2  B2(g)     d)  Assume the following system is at equilibrium:  A2(g) + B2(g)  = 2AB(g)    When this equilibrium is perturbed by a stress, the system will respond in order to establish a new position of equilibrium.  Predict the specified consequence of each stress by writing "increase", "decrease" or "no change" after each sentence         Stress      I)  When AB is removed from the vessel, the amount of B2 will       II)  When A2 is added to the vessel, the amount of B2 will      III)  When the volume of the vessel is decreased by half, K will

YOU SHOULD ENTER YOUR FINAL ANSWERS IN THE ANSWER BOX BELOW.  YOU DO NOT NEED TO SHOW YOUR WORK HERE -- INSTEAD, IT SHOULD BE PROVIDED ON YOUR SCRATCH PAPER.  PLEASE SHOW ALL OF YOUR WORK TO RECEIVE CREDIT AND DON'T FORGET THAT PARTIAL CREDIT IS AVAILABLE.  ALSO, YOUR WORK MUST BE LEGIBLE OR IT WILL NOT BE GRADED!! Ness Corporation has an activity-based costing system with three activity cost pools--Machining, Setting Up, and Other. The company's overhead costs have already been allocated to the cost pools and total $25,200 for the Machining cost pool, $17,200 for the Setting Up cost pool, and $41,600 for the Other cost pool. Costs in the Machining cost pool are assigned to products based on machine-hours (MHs) and costs in the Setting Up cost pool are assigned to products based on the number of batches. Costs in the Other cost pool are not assigned to products. Data concerning the two products and the company's costs appear below:         MHs   Batches     Product R8   6,600   200     Product N8   3,400   800     Total   10,000   1,000               Product R8   Product N8     Sales (total)   $   252,600   $   172,800     Direct materials (total)   $   125,100   $   96,900     Direct labor (total)   $   95,200   $   48,100       REQUIRED: 1.  Calculate activity rates for each activity cost pool using activity-based costing. 2.  Determine the amount of overhead cost that would be assigned to each product using activity-based costing. 3.

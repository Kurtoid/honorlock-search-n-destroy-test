ABC Company has provided the following contribution format income statement. Assume that the following information is within the relevant range.         Sales (4,000 units)   $240,000     Variable expenses   $156,000     Contribution margin   $84,000     Fixed expenses   $81,900     Operating income   $2,100       The break-even point in dollar sales is closest to:
What will the nurse use to evaluate the effectiveness of a diuretic?  (Select the four that apply by listing the letters to the correct answers in alphabetical order using no punctuation or spaces) A.  Daily weight B.  Edema assessment C.  Blood pressure D.   Heart rate E.   Urine output
Solve the following system of equations. Enter your solution as an ordered triple (x,y,z). If there is no solution, enter DNE. x+y+z=82x-2y+2z=4x+y-z=12{"version":"1.1","math":"x+y+z=82x-2y+2z=4x+y-z=12"}
Which of the following should a DBA keep in mind when designing and building a database to ensure the fastest possible response to changes in business requirements?
A certain system uses two-factor authentication. Let the first method be A1 and the second one  A2. Also, assume that the guessing entropy for A1 is e1 bits and the guessing entropy for A2 is e2 bits.  If A1 and A2 are totally independent (compromise of A1 provides no help is compromising A2 and vice versa), what will be the total entropy of the two-factor method that uses both A1 and A2? (5 pts.)  Now consider the password hardening paper discussed in class. A1 is defined by the user password and A2 is defined by the keystroke timing derived hardening features. In this case, can A1 and A2 be considered independent?  Provide a brief explanation for your answer. (5 pts.)  Sensors these days can also measure the pressure with which a key is pressed. If we add such sensors to keyboards and the password hardening system, we can also define an additional feature based on the pressure measured when each key is pressed. If the password is n characters long, what would be the best case hardening entropy (entropy only due to the keystroke timing and pressure derived features) in this system. (6 pts.)  Assume as users gain more experience typing the same text string, they become faster. Assume Bob is a slow user but his password typing pattern gradually changes and he becomes fast after sufficient number of successful logins.  If  consecutive timing measurements are very close (i.e., gradual change), does the password hardening algorithm adapt to this slow change of timing values and allow Bob to log into the system on each request? (5 pts) If an attacker has knowledge of such user typing behavior, what time is better for the attacker to target Bob's account (early when Bob is slow, late when Bob is fast or in between)? (5 pts)

In humans there is a genetic disorder that results from a dominant mutation present in a gene located in the pseudoautosomal region of the Y chromosome and on the X chromosome. Which of the following statements is CORRECT?
Make sure to include proper notation - such as f'(x) - on all answers (unless otherwise indicated).  Remember, work MUST be shown for all problems.  You MUST enter your final answer in Canvas, but you should show your work on your paper.  Scan your work BEFORE submitting your test, and upload work within 5 minutes of submitting your test.  To get credit for a problem, you MUST have work, and your answer in Canvas must 'match' the uploaded work.  No credit will be awarded for problems with no work shown. If you would like to use the Desmos scientific calculator for the test, please click here.

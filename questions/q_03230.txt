On January 1 of the current year, Rhondell Corporation has accumulated E & P of $13,000. Current E & P for the year is $84,000, earned evenly throughout the year. Elizabeth and Jonathan are sole equal shareholders of Rhondell from January 1 to April 30. On May 1, Elizabeth sells all of her stock to Marshall. Rhondell makes two distributions to shareholders during the year: a total of $42,000 ($21,000 to Elizabeth and $21,000 to Jonathan) on April 30 and a total of $58,000 ($29,000 to Jonathan and $29,000 to Marshall) on December 31.   Determine the allocation of the distributions by completing the table below. Assume the shareholders have sufficient basis in their stock for any amount that is treated as return of capital.           From Current E & P   From Accumulated E & P   Treated as Return of Capital     April 30 distribution of $42,000                 December 31 distribution of $58,000

Slanted surfaces with friction: In the figure, a T-bar ski tow pulls a skier up a hill inclined at 10deg above horizontal. The skier starts from rest and is pulled by a cable that exerts a tension T at an angle of 30deg above the surface of the hill. The mass of the skier is 60 kg and the effective coefficient of kinetic friction between the skis and the snow is 0.100. What is the maximum tension in the cable if the starting acceleration is not to exceed 0.400 g?

In AutoCAD an absolute coordinate is measured relative to the _________.
An 0.80-kg block is held in place against the spring by a 67-N horizontal external force. The external force is removed, and the block is projected with a velocity v1 = 1.2 m/s upon separation from the spring. The block descends a ramp and has a velocity v2 = 1.9 m/s at the bottom. The track is frictionless between points A and B. The block enters a rough section at B, extending to E. The coefficient of kinetic friction over this section is 0.39. The velocity of the block is v3 = 1.4 m/s at C. The block moves on to D, where it stops.

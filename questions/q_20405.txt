The following experiment has been conducted: Two cell lines have been created such that each cell line expresses an integral membrane protein that can be labeled with fluorescent markers. Cell line A has a blue marker on its surface (1) Cell line B has a red marker on its surface (2) Cells A and Cell B in culture are allowed to come in contact and are stimulated to fuse (3) to form a hybrid cell (4). After some time, the distribution of the A and B markers is shown to be randomized in the hybrid cell (5).   Changing which of the following parameters of the cell culture would lengthen the time to form the arrangement in (5) (i.e., increase the time necessary to go from 4 to 5)?

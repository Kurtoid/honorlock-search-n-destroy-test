When a new disease appeared in the 1980s, doctors and officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control tried to understand why they were seeing numerous immune system failures in gay men. Initially, they named this disease: Gay-Related Immuno-Deficiency (GRID). With more evidence over time, they recognized that IV drug users and recipients of blood donations also got the disease, and concluded that the disease was caused by exchanges of infected blood, and was not exclusive to gay men. So they renamed the disease: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). They then tried to educate the public that AIDS had to do with the exchange of blood and sexual fluids, and wasn't just a problem of the gay community. This process by which societies give meanings to events and create shared understandings, is an example of:
The _____ code means a browser should create a link to the index.html file for a website using the image file named image.png as the link object.
An example of a dual relationship would be:
Ben and Claire are married and are living through a pandemic. Claire was already an anxious person prior the pandemic but staying cooped up at home has made her anxiety even more severe, causing her to be emotional and irritable with Ben. However, Ben recognizes the source of his wife's behaviors and is skilled at calming her down through reassuring communication. According to the Vulnerability-Stress-Adaptation model, Claire's anxiety can be considered...

Genetic algorithms are superior compared to other nongradient search methods in that they can effectively identify regions where potential local optima exist by generating random designs based on stochastic parameters at several phases throughout the algorithm.
Jarrod was an active man who was extremely interested in physical fitness.  Running, going to the gym, and being outdoors were a major part of Jarrod's life.  When Jarrod became unable to complete a run or his weight exercises, he became worried.  He was experiencing muscle weakness and fatigue more and more frequently in his daily life.  Where Jarrod had once been able to go to the gym three days a week for weight training and lift one hundred sixty pounds, he was now lucky to lift seventy-five pounds for just one full repetition before his muscles were no longer able to continue.    His doctor told him he had an autoimmune disorder called Myasthenia gravis where the body's immune system attacks the skeletal muscle cells, making them respond slower to the nervous system and present weaker contractions.  Jarrod didn't understand what any of that meant so the doctor proceeded to explain to him the importance of the nerves and muscles working together.   The neuromuscular junction is an important communication point in the human body.  This junction illustrates how the nervous system and the muscular system use electric and chemical signals to communicate.  This communication allows for our conscious control of skeletal muscles, so it's vital to our daily functions.   For this junction to work we must first produce an action potential in a motor neuron.  This action potential will propagate down an axon and cause voltage-gated calcium channels to open.  The calcium ion will enter the presynaptic terminal and initiate the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  The acetylcholine will be released by exocytosis and diffuse across the synapse and bind to ligand-gated sodium channels on the postsynaptic membrane (skeletal muscle).  This will cause the ligand-gated sodium channels to open and allow sodium to enter the cell membrane of the skeletal muscle.  Once threshold is passed, an action potential is generated along the cell membrane of the skeletal muscle.  Muscle contraction will occur soon after.   For the muscle to relax, acetylcholine must be removed from the sodium channels by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.  This will break down the acetylcholine into acetic acid and choline.  The choline will be transported back into the terminal end of the axon and the acetic acid diffuses away from the synapse.   The doctor proceeded to explain that in individuals with Myasthenia gravis, the person's immune system attacks and destroys the ligand-gated sodium channels on the postsynaptic membrane of the skeletal muscle cell.  With fewer ligand-gated sodium channels, it takes longer for the threshold to be met to generate an action potential and weakens the contraction strength of the muscle.   Jarrod was shocked to learn that it was his own body that had caused the disease and to also learn that his condition was incurable.  His doctor informed him that he could use corticosteroids and immunosuppressant medicines to prevent any further attacks, but the current damage was permanent.  Jarrod would be unable to continue living as physically active as he had previously been, but in time he would learn the extent of his physical capabilities and slowly define a new normal for his life. 9.

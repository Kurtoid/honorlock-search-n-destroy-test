This is the 1st Non-multiple choice question.  You must do seven of the 12.  You MUST do at least one of #1, 5, and 11 (geologic time).  However many of the Geologic Time questions you do, they count towards the seven of the 12. 1. Hypothetically, suppose we have a radioactive isotope of 99Tc, (atomic number 43).  Figure out what isotope (including atomic mass number and atomic number) will result when 99Tc undergoes each of the following types of decay: alpha decay, beta decay, electron capture.  To help, a portion of the periodic table including Tc and several nearby elements is included below.  Figure 12: Note 1: the number at the bottom of each square is the atomic weight, and will not be used in this problem.Note 2: for simplicity, just enter your answers, do not give the equation. Alpha Decay:  Atomic Mass Number: [AlphaMassNum]                                 Atomic Number:  [AlphaAtNum]                                 Element Symbol: [AlphaElement] Beta Decay: Atomic Mass Number: [BetaMassNum]                              Atomic Number:  [BetaAtNum]                               Element Symbol: [BetaElement] Electron Capture: Atomic Mass Number: [ECMassNum]                                         Atomic Number:  [ECAtNum]                                         Element Symbol: [ECElement]

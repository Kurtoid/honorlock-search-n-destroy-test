1800 Degrees Below is a new nitrogen ice cream store with not concept of how temperature is actually measured. The company want to be certain that their product is served at the right temperature and that it does not vary.  To that end they have their regional managers sample one store from there district each day and assess the temperature of the an outgoing item at random.  The data is presented below.  What is the appropriate value of the upper control limits if we do NOT know the standard deviation of the process (choose the nearest values)?

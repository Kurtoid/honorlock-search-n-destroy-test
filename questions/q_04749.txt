Sketch the total electric field change vs. time due to a typical first leader-return stroke sequence lowering negative charge to earth at 1 km, 10 km, and 100 km. Use as many time scales at each distance as necessary to show all significant waveform characteristics. Give approximate amplitude and time scales.     2 (35%). Sketch the magnetostatic and radiation components of the magnetic field vs. time due to a lightning return stroke whose current waveform is sketched below. Assume that the channel is straight and vertical, channel length H

If the price elasticity of demand for tickets to a modern dance performance in Ruby Diamond during 7-Days of Opening Nights at FSU is -1.20 at a ticket price $40, how much would ticket sales fall if the price were lowered to $39, given that the demand for tickets at $40 is 1000? Compute the total revenues that FSU would receive at both ticket prices $40 and $39. Which ticket price should FSU choose if it is only interested in maximizing profit from the performance, given that the cost of the performance is the same in both cases. (Seating capacity at Ruby Diamond is 1,170.)

Some definitions/concepts:  Select the best choice from the drop-down box in each question (A-G). Each question is worth 7 points. A. The heat change that occurs when ions in the gas phase condense into exactly one-mole of a solid ionic compound is called [lattice]. B. Which force of attraction is NEVER broken when a pure molecular substance evaporates from the liquid to the gas state? [covalent] C. An aqueous solution that contains an equilibrium concentration of solute at a fixed temperature is defined as [saturated]. D. The temperature in which water vapor in air below its equilibrium point condenses into liquid water is called [dewpoint]. E. Molecular substances like Urea (CH4N2O) are classified as non-electrolytes because they do not conduct electricity when dissolved in water. Salts like potassium nitrate, do conduct electricity in water and are classified as electrolytes. If a 3.0 m solution of urea in water freezes at -5.5 oC, then a 3.0 m solution of K(NO3)2 is predicted to freeze at [freeze] Celsius. F. Molecules with the same chemical formula in which the atoms are bonded together in different structures are called [isomers]. G. Solution properties that vary with total solute concentration regardless of the size, shape and / or charge of the solute. [colligative]

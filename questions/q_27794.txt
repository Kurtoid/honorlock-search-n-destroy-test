The Industrial Revolution led to dramatic changes in American society. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, it could take weeks to produce a single shirt. Wool had to be turned into yarn, then dyed, made into fabric, and sewn into patterns--all by hand. When machines were introduced, this whole process could be done in a fraction of the time. Many workers' lives were affected by the industrial changes. Instead of working in their homes or on farms, men, women, and children were soon working twelve- and fourteen-hour days in factories. Workers such as tailors or carpenters who previously had their own trade found themselves employed in the very places that drove them out of business. Another result was that whole villages started being built around factories, providing families with jobs, houses, schools, churches, and stores--all in one place.

Wengert Products, Inc., has a Motor Division that manufactures and sells a number of products, including a standard motor. Data concerning that motor appear below:                    Capacity in units       40,000     Selling price to outside customers   $   59     Variable cost per unit   $   17     Fixed cost per unit (based on capacity)   $   21     The Automotive Division of Wengert Products, Inc needs 8,000 special heavy-duty motors per year. The Motor Division's variable cost to manufacture and ship this special motor would be $20 per unit. Because these special motors would require more manufacturing resources than the standard motor, the Motor Division would have to reduce its production and sales of standard motors to outside customers from 40,000 units per year to 27,200 units per year. What is the total contribution margin on sales to outside customers that the Motor Division would give up if it were to make the special motors for the Automotive Division?

Suppose a firm has a monopoly over the sale of smartwatches in the U.S. The inverse demand for smartwatches in Florida is given by P1(q1) = 170 - 2q1, and the inverse demand in New York is given by P2(q2) = 280 - 5q2, where q1 and q2 are the total output of smartwatches sold in Florida and New York, respectively. The demand for smartwatches in each market is observable to the monopolist. The firm has a constant marginal cost of $50 and zero fixed costs. Assume that the firm can charge different prices in each market.  What is the profit-maximizing quantity sold to consumers in the New York market?

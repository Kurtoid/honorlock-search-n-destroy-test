Regarding the suprahyoid muscles, enlarges the pharynx
[15 points] An airport runway, used only for departures (i.e., take-offs), serves two types of aircraft: heavy, H, and light, L. Demand for service among these two aircraft types is statistically independent, such that each departing aircraft has probability PH of being a heavy one and probability PL of being a light one, and PH and PL remain fixed over time.  Aircrafts are served first-in-first-out with no attempt to control the sequences of Hand Lin the departing stream. You can assume that PH = 0.4. All aircraft (whether H or L) exhibit identical looking trajectories as they depart from the runway. Each reaches a cruise speed of 120 knots (nautical miles/hour) some distance beyond the end of the runway and then maintains this speed for a very long time.   (a) [5 points] Sketch the trajectories of two departing aircraft (of any type).  Draw these trajectories from the time they begin accelerating (at the beginning of the runway) until both reach the cruise speed. Label i) the cruise speed; and ii) the spacing and the headway once both aircrafts reach this speed.  Also designate the beginning and end of the runway on your sketch. (Show your work in the file submitted.)   (b) [10 points] Once two consecutive aircraft have both reached the cruise speed, they must maintain some minimum spacing (for safety).  This minimum spacing is 5 nautical miles (nm) whenever a heavy aircraft is followed by a light aircraft (HL).  For the three other possible sequences (HH, LL, LH), the minimum spacing between aircraft is 3 nm. Derive an expression (in terms of the variables given) for the runway's capacity to serve departures. (Show your work in the file submitted.) Alternatively, determine the runway's capacity assuming PH = 0.4.

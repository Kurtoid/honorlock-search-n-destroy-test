Carnosine (shown below) is a dipeptide molecule made up of the amino acids b-alanine and histidine bound together through an amide bond. It is highly concentrated in muscle and brain tissues and has been proven to scavenge reactive oxygen species, among other things.  Consider the different conformations of carnosine through the C2-C3 bond and answer the following questions. Which of the Newman structures below represents the conformation wherein the dihedral angle between the "Im" group and the "NH(b-Ala)" group is 180deg? [180deg] Which of the Newman structures below represents the conformation wherein the dihedral angle between the "Im" group and the "NH(b-Ala)" group is 0deg? [0deg] Which Newman structure of carnosine (through the C2-C3 bond) shown below shows the molecule in its lowest energy conformation (assume "NH(b-Ala)" is larger than CO2H)? [lowestE] Which Newman structure of carnosine (through the C2-C3 bond) shown below shows the molecule in its highest energy conformation (assume "NH(b-Ala)" is larger than CO2H)? [highestE] What is the relationship between structures B and E below? [relationship]

Note: FRQ 4 has three independent scenarios: Part (a), Part (b), and Part (c). Prepare all appropriate journal entries for each part. In this section you answer Part (A).  [FRQ4 PART (A)] On January 1, 2018, Nobel Corporation acquired machinery at a cost of $1,600,000. Nobel adopted the straight-line method of depreciation for this machine and had been recording depreciation over an estimated life of ten years, with no residual value. At the beginning of 2021, a decision was made to change to the double-declining balance method of depreciation for this machine.   [REQUIRED] What is the journal entry Nobel should record in 2021?

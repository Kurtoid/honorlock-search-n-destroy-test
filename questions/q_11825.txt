When producing unfertilized eggs, female fruit flies deposit mRNA coding for the Bicoid protein at the anterior (head and upper body) side of the egg. Following fertilization, a concentration gradient of Bicoid develops that ranges from high concentration of the protein at the anterior end to a low concentration at the posterior (abdomen and rear end) end. Where Bicoid is present, anterior structures form; in its absence, posterior structures form. Bicoid therefore plays a critical role in the development of structures in the fruit fly. Based on this information, Bicoid is therefore most likely ______.

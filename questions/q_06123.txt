Pliny, the governor of two areas in the early second century AD, wrote to the Roman emperor Trajan about his manner of dealing with Christians. In this section of Trajan's response, he gave his opinion of Pliny's actions. You observed proper procedure, my dear Pliny, in sifting the cases of those who had been denounced to you as Christians. For it is not possible to lay down any general rule to serve as a kind of fixed standard. They are not to be sought out; if they are denounced and proved guilty, they are to be punished, with this reservation, that whoever denies that he is a Christian and really proves it--that is, by worshiping our gods--even though he was under suspicion in the past, shall obtain pardon through repentance. But anonymously posted accusations ought to have no place in any prosecution. For this is both a dangerous kind of precedent and out of keeping with the spirit of our age.  Trajan's response indicates what attitude toward Pliny's actions?

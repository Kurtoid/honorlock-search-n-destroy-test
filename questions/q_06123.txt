A sample of aluminum reacts with an excess of HCl (aq), and the liberated hydrogen gas is collected over water at a temperature of 24 0C.   The volume of gas collected at a total barometric pressure of 782.4 torr is [x] liters.  (Vapor pressure of H2O at 24 0C is 22.4 torr)                        2 Al (s)  +  6 HCl (aq)    -  2 AlCl3 (aq)   +  3 H2 (g) How many grams of aluminum reacted?

Example: A company that produces motorcycles has a daily production cost of                     C(x)=2000-15x+0.05x2{"version":"1.1","math":"C(x)=2000-15x+0.05x2"} where C is the cost in dollars to manufacture a motorcycle and x is the number of motorcycles produced. How many motorcycles can be produced each day in order to minimize the cost of each motorcycle?Solution:The graph of the quadratic function is a parabola.Rewrite the quadratic function in standard form.                    C(x)=0.05x2-15x+2000{"version":"1.1","math":"C(x)=0.05x2-15x+2000"}The parabola opens up, because a{"version":"1.1","math":"a"} is positive:  a=0.05>0{"version":"1.1","math":"a=0.05>0"}Because the parabola opens up, the vertex of the parabola is a minimum.Find the x-coordinate of the vertex.                    x=-b2a=-(-15)2(0.05)=150{"version":"1.1","math":"x=-b2a=-(-15)2(0.05)=150"} Answer: The company keeps cost to a minimum when 150 motorcycles are produced each day. Exercise: The revenue associated with selling vitamins is                     R(x)=500x-0.001x2{"version":"1.1","math":"R(x)=500x-0.001x2"} where R is the revenue in dollars and x is the number of bottles of vitamins sold.Determine how many bottles of vitamins should be sold to maximize the revenue. Show your work in the box below using the Graphical Equation Editor.

A boy is pulling a box on a rough floor. The box is moving at constant velocity, and its free-body diagram is shown on the right. The symbols use the standard notation for the normal force, friction force, and gravity force. The force applied by the boy is simply named "pull". Rank the values of the work done by each of these forces after the box has moved a certain distance to the right of the figure.

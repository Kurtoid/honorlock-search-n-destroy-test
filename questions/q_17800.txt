She underwent a combined right and left heart cardiac catheterization With coronary angiography, Judkins technique, and was determined to have significant atherosclerotic heart disease. She has no history of bypass surgery. Triple coronary arte1y bypass graft (CABG) surgery was recommended for the 80 percent to 90 percent occlusion found in three native coronary vessel . The patient was an active cigarette smoker, documented as nicotine dependent. With counseling and upon consent, the patient was transferred to a medical center licensed to perform open heart surgery and scheduled for the CABG. Once the patient was _safely placed under anesthesia, the left greater saphenous vein was harvested through an open approach. Once the saphenous vein that was to be used as the bypass vascular graft was harvested, it was immediately flushed with DuraGraft Endothelial Damage Inhibitor and then placed into the DuraGraft solution until the anastomoses were performed. This new intraoperative technology was performed to prevent vein graft disease or vein graft failure. Next, the triple coronary artery bypass grafting was performed 011 the left anterior decending the circumflex, and the diagonal arteries. The origin of the bypass was the aorta. This procedure wa performed using extracorporeal circulation while the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass for the duration of the procedure. The final diagnosis documented by the provider at the medical center was triple vessel coronary artery disease, unstable angina, no myocardial infarction. Smoking cessation was strongly advised.

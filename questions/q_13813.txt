VRAAG 2     'n 5 kg-blok wat op 'n ruwe horisontale tafel rus, word met 'n ligte, onrekbare tou wat oor 'n ligte, wrywinglose katrol gaan, met 'n ander blok met massa 2 kg verbind. Die 2 kg-blok hang vertikaal soos in die diagram hieronder aangetoon. 'n Krag van 60 N word op die 5 kg-blok toegepas teen 'n hoek van 10o met die horisontaal, wat veroorsaak dat die blok na links versnel. Die koeffisient van kinetiese wrywing tussen die 5 kg-blok en die oppervlak van die tafel is 0,5. Ignoreer die effekte van lugwrywing.   Regterklik op die onderstaande blou blokkie om die diagram in 'n nuwe venster oop te maak.       2.1   Definieer Newton se Tweede Bewegingswet in woorde.

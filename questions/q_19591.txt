According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 7000 to 8000 people each year in the United States are bitten by a venomous snake, and about 20% of those bites are fatal.  Suppose we select a random sample of 240 people who have been bitten by a venomous snake this year in the US, and consider the proportion that did not survive.  The Central Limit Theorem can be applied to this situation.  Use the z-score method to determine the probability that fewer than 15% would die in a random sample of 240 venomous snake bite victims in the US.  Round your answer to the nearest thousandth.  (Do not round until you get to the final answer.)

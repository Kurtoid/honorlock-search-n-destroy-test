Consider a horizontal plate in a large enclosure. The plate is subjected to uniform irradiation on all sides as shown in the figure below. The ambient air temperature in the enclosure is [Tinf] K with a convection heat transfer coefficient of [h] W/m2 * K. The upper and lower surfaces of the plate have a radiosity of [J] W/m2 and the plate temperature is maintained uniformly at [Ts] K. Ignoring the ends of the plate and if the plate is not opaque and has an absorptivity of [alpha],  determine the emissivity of the plate. (Use the box below to answer this part of the problem) Can the plate be treated as a gray body. Give reasons for your answer.  Stefan Boltzmann Constant is  s = 5.67 x  10  - 8      W/m 2  [?]  K 4    Show all your work on the work upload (assumptions, schematics, analysis, etc.) document. Write down units in your equations. Solve symbolically and plug in numbers at the end.

Determine the limiting reactant (LR) and the mass (in g) of nitrogen that can be formed from 50.0 g N2O4 and 45.0 g N2H4.  Some possibly useful molar masses are as follows:  N2O4 = 92.02 g/mol, N2H4 = 32.05 g/mol.   N2O4(l) + 2 N2H4(l)  -  3 N2(g) + 4 H2O(g)

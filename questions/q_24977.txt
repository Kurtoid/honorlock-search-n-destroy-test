A chemist makes a solution by dissolving 0.261 g of oxalic acid (H2C2O4; molar mass = 90.0349 g/mol) in 250.0 mL of water. Oxalic acid is diprotic, so the balanced neutralization reaction is as follows: H2C2O4(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) - Na2C2O4(aq) + 2H2O(l) The oxalic acid solution was titrated with sodium hydroxide and it was determined that 73.4 mL of base was added to reach the equivalence point - what is the concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution?

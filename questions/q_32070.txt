Given a circuit in Figure 1, answer the following questions. Note: submit sub-questions (a) to (e) on-line. Draw the simplified ckt for (f) and scan+submit to the submission link.        (a) How many faults are there totally in Figure 1?     (b) How many faults are there after equivalent fault collapsing using the labeling technique? Also, list all of the faults.     (c) Identify two more faults in (b) that can be removed using fault dominance collapsing.     (d) How many faults are there if check-point faults are used in Figure 1? List all of them.          (Note: forget (b) and (c) when answering (d) and (e)).

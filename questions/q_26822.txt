The fifteen questions in this exam are based on the following information (repeated in each question for your convenience):Kimbeth Manufacturing uses process costing to control costs in the manufacture of Dust Sensors for the mining industry. The following information pertains to operations for November.   The beginning inventory was 40% complete as to materials and 30% complete as to conversion costs. The ending inventory was 20% complete as to materials and 70% complete as to conversion costs.Costs pertaining to November are as follows:Beginning inventory: direct materials, $20,930; conversion costs, $ 13,750. Costs incurred during the month: direct materials, $182,000; conversion costs, $ 222,040.(For your convenience: Total costs to be accounted for=20,930+13,750+182,000+222,040=$ 438,720)Q7. What is the total cost per equivalent unit, assuming Kimbeth uses first-in, first-out (FIFO) process costing?

Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr 2.60 liters of oxygen gas is produced at 0.25 atm of pressure. It is to be compressed and stored in a 200 mL cylinder.  If the temperature is constant, calculate the pressure, in mm Hg, of the oxygen in the cylinder.   To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem.  Show your work (equation/and units) by using the equation editor () in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use   to insert ratios. Be sure to include proper units and the final answer! Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

Question 1: Please read the attached article and answer the following questions (Hint: Please devote equal amounts of space to questions 1, 2, and 3)    Song, M., Meier, K. J., & Amirkhanyan, A. (2020). Goal ambiguity, management, and performance in US nursing homes. Administration & Society, 52(8): 1170-1208.     The article uses interaction effects to examine its main theoretical argument.    What's the article's main theoretical argument, and why do the authors use interaction effects to test it? When answering this question, please explain what interaction effects are. When using an OLS regression-based design to test interactions, what are important statistical numbers to evaluate, and how would you do this? For example, in Table 1, Model 1b, how would you interpret the numbers associated with the "Sharing power x Goal ambiguity" variable? What is the role of marginal effect plots in testing interaction effects? Compare the plots for "sharing power" and "external management" in Figure 1. Explain how you would read the plots and the conclusions you would draw from them.      Some people may argue that, rather than this being an interaction, there could be a mediation at play, where goal ambiguity affects managerial behavior, which--as a second step--affects organizational performance.    What is mediation? Would you consider testing for a mediation in the context of the Song et al. (2020) article? Why or why not? Please justify your choice. Explain how one could examine the proposed mediation effect using the data employed by Song and her colleagues.      Discuss the strength and weaknesses of the article's methodological approach. How would you improve their research design and statistical analysis?    Question 2: You are asked to complement Song et al.'s (2020) study with a qualitative study. Answer the following questions regarding this complementary qualitative study.    Assume that you will be using the case study method in your qualitative research design. What would be your rationale for using this method? How you would select your case study site(s)? Explain the process. Detail how you would collect and analyze data on your case study site(s). Make sure to discuss at least two qualitative data collection methods. Which qualitative data collection method will you utilize first and why?

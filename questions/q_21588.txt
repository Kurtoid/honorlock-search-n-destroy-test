Researchers are studying the average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline across the country.  Last year at this time, the average price at all stations nationwide was $3.17 per gallon.  But, this year, a random sample of 67 stations had an average price of $3.09 per gallon, with a standard deviation of $0.28 per gallon.  These researchers would like to test that the average price at all stations nationwide is lower now than it was last year.  What alternative hypothesis should the official use to test their claim?

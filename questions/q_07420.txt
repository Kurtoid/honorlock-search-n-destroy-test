Many processes in the biogeochemical cycles we've discussed are directly affected by pH. Discuss three examples of the importance of pH in the C, N, P, or S cycles. Be sure to include relevant chemical reactions (do not have to be balanced) and a discussion of the implications for cycling of the particular element under high and low pH conditions.

Given a non-empty Binary Search Tree (BST) and a target value, write a program in pseudocode or C++ code to find the 3rd largest element in BST in O(n) time where n denotes the number of nodes in the tree. The function prototype is given as following: int thirdLargest(TreeNode* root)  We have defined the following C++ TreeNode class for you: class TreeNode {public:   int val;   TreeNode *left;   TreeNode *right;   TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}   TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}   TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}};  Example: Given the following BST   Your method should return 9 as it is the 3rd largest element in the above BST.

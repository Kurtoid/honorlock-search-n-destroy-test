Skill B3.  (This problem is based on the port selection problem described by De Icaza et al., 2019.)  The decision-maker plans to use the weights determined as described in Skill B2 and to use linear utility functions for each attribute.  Note that larger values for depth, berths, and cranes are preferred; smaller values for traffic delay are preferred.  Calculate the total utility of each port alternative. Attribute values for the port alternatives (De Icaza et al., 2019).

Grams of Fat   Calories     19   410     31   580     34   590     35   570     39   640     39   680     43   660     Use your regression equation from the previous problem (in rounded form). Predict the calories for a burger with 35 grams of fat. Round your answer to the nearest 0.01. The predicted value is [num1] calories. Compute the residual for a burger with 35 grams of fat. Round your answer to the nearest 0.01. Be sure to include the negative sign if appropriate. The residual is [num2].

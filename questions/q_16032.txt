Professor Jones develops an instrument to measure Cultural Identity for Children in Cross-Racial Adoptions (CICRA).  The scale was administered to a group of 86 children.  Professor Jones reports a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .76 for the scores on the instrument. Along with CICRA, Prof. Smarty also administered a well-established measure, used in many studies of ethnic, racial or cultural identity, titled Personal Cultural Inventory. He also administered a measure of self-esteem, hypothesizing that his new measure should be significantly correlated with self-esteem based on theory about cultural identity development. The results of further analysis indicated that the correlation between the CICRA and the Personal Acculturation Scale was r=.33, p=.02.  The correlation between the CICRA and the self-esteem measure was r=.21, p=.18.   When Professor Jones asked a panel of adoption and race theory experts to evaluate the measure, most (7 out of 8) judged that the items of the CICRA capture all of the critical aspects of Cultural Identity that they know of.  Also, Professor Jones's colleagues were asked to read over the instrument without being told what it was evaluating beforehand. Several guessed that it was intended to measure the quality of social and familial support as well as certain aspects of cultural self-awareness; they gave some suggestions for focusing the items more on cultural identity.   A week after administering his new measure of CICRA, he re-administered it to the 86 children.  The correlation (Pearson's r) of the scores on the two administrations of the new CICRA instrument was .65 (p

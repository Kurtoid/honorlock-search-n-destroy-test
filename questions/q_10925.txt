PROMPT: Does online education help students? Supporters argue that the flexibility of the format benefits students, particularly older ones who have full-time jobs or families. The ability to review materials such as past lectures online is also advantageous. Since students use the Internet in many other ways, it is logical for them to use it to attend school as well. Another advantage of distance learning is geographical, supporters assert. Students who are kept home most of the time due to illness or disability, as well as those living in geographically isolated areas, can all benefit from online education. The fact that students already use the Internet for other purposes makes online education an ideal format, proponents contend. Particularly among younger students, they say, being online is second nature. Supporters argue that students are often more comfortable, and therefore more engaged, reading lectures and making comments online than they would be in an actual classroom. "They're very much accustomed to using [the Internet] for recreation, for communication," says Liz Pape, chief executive officer of Massachusetts-based Virtual High School. "So now, if we train our teachers properly, they can use technology as a tool for delivering engaging information." Opponents argue that taking classes online deprives students of the full educational experience, which involves relating to other people in addition to absorbing information. In addition, some classes can be difficult to convert to an online format, both for instructors and for students. Another charge leveled at online education is that it has the potential to violate students' privacy. The Higher Education Act could encourage schools to require cameras and other monitoring devices in the homes of students to prevent cheating, they note. That highlights a central problem of verifying student honesty in distance learning, they say. Critics of distance learning also contend that there are major drawbacks to taking classes online. For one thing, they say, the courses require students to be self-motivated, making it less likely that many of them will receive the full benefit of the classes. For another, they add, online students miss out on some of the experiences of a traditional classroom. It is harder for students taking online courses to connect to teachers and other students, they argue. "People who are really behind this drive to online education don't realize that the education process is more about developing a relationship than about delivering the material," says Connel Fullenkamp, an associate professor of economics at Duke University in Durham, N.C.

Stop when you reach a stable route, meaning when the last row repeats the previous row. The last two rows of your table should be identical.    Answer format:Choose "Table" in the question editing menu and enter the table values accordingly. The first column should show the set {X,Y,Z} of nodes. The entries is all of the other columns should show the cost and the path followed for that cost. Example: If there is a cost of N to get from node X to node Z through node Y, then the entry should be:  "N (X-Y-Z) ".  There should not be any blank entries.

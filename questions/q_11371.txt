"Chocolate Coated Sugar Bombs" cereal is packaged in boxes that are supposed to contain 32.4 ounces of cereal.  However, problems with the production machinery can result in boxes that are either systematically under-filled or over-filled.  A quality control engineer collects a random sample of 25 boxes from the production line and if the evidence points to an average weight that is different than 32.4 ounces, she will call a halt to production.  From her sample she obtains an average weight of 34.1 ounces with a standard deviation of 6.1 ounces.  Please answer the following questions: The standard error of the sample mean is (round to 2 decimal places) is [SE] pounds and the test statistic is (rounded to 3 decimal places is [TestStat]. The degrees of freedom for this test is (round to a whole number or write "none") [df]. The -value of the test (rounded to 4 decimal places) is [pval].   Thus at the 5% level of significance she would (type either "reject" or "fail to reject") without the quotes: [concl] the null hypothesis. Will the engineer call a halt to production?

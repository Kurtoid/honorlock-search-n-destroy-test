You have a circular coil of 40 loops of wire with an area of 0.03 m2 that you want to place into a uniform magnetic field with a strength of 0.01 T.   Make a sketch showing how you would orient the coil inside the magnetic field so that the wire would feel the largest torque if a current were flowing through it. You may choose any direction for the magnetic field, but be sure to clearly indicate the direction of the field in your sketch. [1] Add the direction of current flow to your sketch and describe with words or with a labeled arrow in what direction the loop would start to turn if current were flowing in that direction. [1] How much current would you need to pass through the wire so that the magnitude of the torque would be 1.5 N*m? [4]

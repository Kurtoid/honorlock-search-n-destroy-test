F1: Coulomb's Law Calculation Numerical Answer (2 pts) AA batteries supply temporary electricity to small devices to power them. Normally the charges within the battery cancel each-other out because they are all in positive-negative pairs.   If we were able to defy the laws of chemistry and physics to separate these positive and negative charges from each other we would end up with about [a] C and -[a] C respectively. These are impressively large charges! What would the force between these positive and negative charges if they were separated by a huge distance of [d] m?  Use k = 8.99*109 Nm2/C2 Type your answer below properly rounded to the nearest whole number! (No units! You'll add those below!)

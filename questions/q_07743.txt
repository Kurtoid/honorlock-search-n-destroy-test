So far, we have only shown it a rectangle (a positive example), and so its definition of a parallelogram is: "A closed shape with four sides, in two pairs of differing lengths, connected by four right angles." Now, imagine each of the following shapes is presented to the agent second, along with the annotation as to whether it is (+) or isn't (-) a parallelogram.

Consider the following relationship scenario: You've had some pretty good relationships in the past.  Your new friend James has introduced you to a number of wonderful interests: obscure Tarantino films, visits to museums, Thai food, and hang-gliding.  Still, if there's one thing about James that drives you crazy, it's that he never stops talking, and will actually change his position on issues just to bait you into an argument.  You argue more with James than with just about anyone else you know, and you frequently end up with your feelings hurt.

A 30.0 kg block is attached to a very light horizontal spring of force constant 500 N/m and is resting on a frictionless horizontal table. (See Figure below) Suddenly it is struck by a 3.00 kg stone traveling horizontally at 8.00 m/s to the right, whereupon the stone rebounds at 2.00 m/s horizontally to the left.

Below is a small tree with two clades, A and B. All sequences with names ending in A are in clade A and all sequences with names ending in B are in clade B. Clades A and B are paralogs. Next to the tree is a short multiple sequence alignment (MSA) arranged in the order of the tree so that each sequence corresponds to its adjacent leaf (the first sequence is for CAT_A, the second for DOG_A, etc). Some sites are conserved, some are changing in physicochemical amino acid property from one clade to the other, and some are changing in amino acid but the property is conserved. Which site changes charge from one paralog to the other?

Toby and Josh were having a disagreement on the front lawn of a home owned by Charlie. Toby ended up striking Josh three times in the head, causing Josh serious injury. Charlie witnessed this fight and did nothing, nor did Charlie call the police or ambulance after Josh was hit. Josh wanted to sue Toby, but learned Toby had no money. Therefore, Josh sued Charlie in Federal Court for his injuries. Charlie defended that #1, the owner of property cannot be held responsible for injuries that occur on that property through the actions of another person, and #2, that even if the owner of property could be liable, that Josh caused his own injuries because Toby hit Josh in self-defense (ie. That Josh was about to hit Toby before Toby hit Josh) and #3, that the federal court doesn't have jurisdiction to hear the case, only Texas court does!

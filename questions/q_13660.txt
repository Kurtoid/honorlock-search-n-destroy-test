Aerospace Manufacturing (Canvas Q16~22, Handwritten Pages Q16/19/20) Titanium is a very versatile metal, finding many uses in various forms in mechanical engineering. Building safe and long-lasting aircraft and spacecraft requires specialized materials that are strong and resistant to corrosion, yet relatively lightweight. Titanium alloys fit these requirements nicely, and are very widely used in the aerospace industry as a result; one type of titanium alloy, Ti-6Al-4V, makes up about 50% of all metal alloys used in airplanes! In order to make pure titanium metal, it must first be extracted from titanium-containing ores. The most important titanium ore, ilmenite (FeTiO3), is processed via reaction with chlorine gas as shown below. 2 FeTiO3 (s) + 7 Cl2 (g) + 6 C (s,graphite) - 2 TiCl4 (l) + 2 FeCl3 (s) + 6 CO (g)                    DHdeg = ? The standard enthalpy of formation of solid ilmenite is estimated to be DHdegf(FeTiO3) = -295.[a] kcal/mol. Calculate the standard enthalpy of reaction for the above reaction as written, in units of kilojoules.

Scenario QuestionsPlease use the following information to answer the question(s) below.Fairy rings are circles of fungi that often appear in open meadows and in forest areas. In the soil beneath the fungi is an ever-extending mycelium. As the mycelium spreads to seek out more food, it sometimes will produce the fungi we see above ground. The figure depicts the outline of a fairy ring that has appeared overnight in an open meadow, as viewed from above. The ring represents the farthest advance of this mycelium through the soil. Locations A-D are all 0.5 meters below the soil surface.All four locations are 0.5 m below the surface.

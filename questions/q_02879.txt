Case Study: Darwin's Finches In 1977 the Galapagos had abnormally low rainfall, and the seed plants on which the medium ground finch, Geospiza fortis, depend produced small crops. Only 15% of the population survived the drought, and the survivors were the mostly large birds with strong beaks, because they were able to crack large seeds. The population as a whole was shifted toward larger body size. The level of selection measured in the drought and the drastic population crash was the highest yet recorded in a vertebrate population. However, a few years later there was a particularly wet year, and enormous quantities of seeds were produced. The finches had multiple broods that year, and smaller individuals, having great numbers of small seeds available, and reaching maturity faster, raised more offspring. The effect of the wet year was to shift the average body size back toward smaller size. Similar major fluctuations in climate and food supply occur on approximately a 20-year spacing in the Galapagos as El Nino and La Nina perturbs the local climate, producing dry and wet years. Is the population of finches on this island in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium?

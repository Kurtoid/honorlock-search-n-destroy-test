Part V.  Short Answers - (20 points) YOU MUST Answer  QUESTION NUMBER ONE OR TWO and then you may select an additional question in the next box.  Therefore you will be responding to TWO essay questions in total.  DO NOT exceed 400 words for your first question box or that portion will not be graded.   (MUST ANSWER ONE OF THE FIRST TWO) - 10 points1.  Compare and contrast how the ion calcium is used to establish the cross bridge formation in your thigh, in walls of your aortic arch, and in your left atria.   2.   Compare the action potentials contained in a patient's heart with those contained in their thigh.  Be sure to compare relative refractory periods, resting membrane potentials, and ionic basis of the action potentials and how these above described differences assist in the mechanical functioning of the heart organ versus that of the leg muscle.

All of the following compounds are acids containing chlorine. Which compound is the weakest acid?
Which of the following is the best definition of generation time in a bacterium?
Interstitial hydrostatic pressure remains nearly constant and close to 0 mm Hg due to the activity of the lymphatic system, which siphons excess interstitial fluid into lymphatic vessels. Lymphatic vessels are not associated with a positive-pressure pump, so lymph in these vessels in always under very low pressure.  Like veins, lymphatic vessels possess _____ to ensure that lymphatic flow is one-way (toward the heart).
A characteristic of an autosomal recessive disorder is:
2) (25 pts) At one time, it was proposed that a total dislocation in a face centered cubic (FCC) can be decomposed into two asymmetric partial dislocations.  Points A, B, and C are the lattice points on the slip plane.  d lies in the center of line BC.  (a) If AB, BC, and AC represent the Burgers vectors of three total dislocations in this plane, please identify AB, BC, and AC with their proper Burgers vector expressed in the vector notation. Note Burgers vector notation represents both direction and magnitude. (b) If Ad, dB, and dC represent the Burgers vectors of partial dislocations in this plane, please identify Ad, dB, and dC with their proper Burgers vector expressed in the vector notation. Note Burgers vector notation represents both direction and magnitude. (c) Please demonstrate AB=Ad+dB using Burger's vector calculation. (d) Please use the vector energy calculation and notations to determine whether this dislocation decomposition AB a Ad+dB is energy favorable or not.
Cerebrospinal fluid flows within the
Analyzing the business case including SWOT analysis, analyzing internal and external project factors, conducting feasibility studies, fact-finding, and presenting a call-to-action to management are steps in which SDLC phase?
QUESTIONS 17 THROUGH 28, USE THIS NARRATIVE AND THE GRAPHIC ABOVE. You are doing Boundary Surveys of multiple parcels in Section 6, and must establish all of the dashed lines (1/4 section, 1/16 sections, and all Government Lots) shown. Distances in feet are based on your field survey wherein you properly established all 8 original USPLSS corners.   For the labeled lines (numeric), provide the field surveyed distance.  For the labeled points (alpha), provide the correct methodology (single proportionate measure, double proportionate measure, intersection or midpoint). 17. POINT A = _________

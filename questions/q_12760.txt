The drive wheel of a vehicle having mass m = 1 kg and radius of gyration kC = 1.5 m rolls without slipping against a stationary surface. The vehicle's drive train applies opposing forces P of magnitude 10 N to an inner hub of radius Ri of the wheel. The wheel's inner and outer radii are RO = 2 m, Ri = 1 m. (a)  (25 points) Find the acceleration of point C in magnitude and direction assuming that the wheel does not slip. (b)  (5 points) Do the two forces P supply a net force to the wheel? Do the two forces do work on the wheel as it rolls? Briefly explain your answers.

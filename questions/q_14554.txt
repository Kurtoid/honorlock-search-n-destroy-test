A proton is first accelerated from rest through a potential difference V and then enters a uniform 0.750-T magnetic field oriented perpendicular to its path. In this field, the proton follows a circular arc having a radius of curvature of 1.84 cm. What was the potential difference V? (mproton = 1.67 x 10-27 kg, e = 1.60 x 10-19 C)

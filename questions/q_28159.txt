The following questions are adapted from case study: Case 1-2019. The New England Journal of Medicine, 2019; 380:178-85  Unit 2 Case Study Summary.     A 36-year-old woman was evaluated in this hospital because of an episode of syncope (fainting) heightened depression, mood symptoms, nightmares, cognitive changes, and high blood pressure.  She served as a combat communication expert in Afghanistan for several tours over the course of 8 years, and had been stationed at a US base for the past 5 years following a traumatic brain injury and a leg injury in a roadside explosion during her second tour, which resulted in the death of 2 fellow servicepersons in another vehicle.  She has a recurring nightmare of the event in which she was the leader of a convoy, and waved the other vehicle to pass hers when the improvised explosive device (IED) went off, for which she feels guilty.  Since being home, she has experienced some family life difficulties related to forgetfulness, fear, emotional distancing, with episodes of yelling outbursts becoming more frequent. While she was once an avid cross fit competitor, she has not been able to work out at that level and finds herself clumsy, which is very troubling.  Her blood pressure is 155/90 mmHg (above normal), heart rate is 78 beat per minute (normal), and respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute (normal).    This patient was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a history of traumatic brain injury. This patient was referred for cardiologist follow up for further evaluation of hypertension (high blood pressure) and prescribed hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic: causing urination to reduce blood volume and pressure) and imipramine (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor for depression).    Stress and depression can cause cellular changes (neuron death, loss of synapses, loss of dendrites) in the brain, and there is some evidence that anti-depressants like imipramine (which increases serotonin and norepinephrine synaptic levels) can reverse cellular damage.  In the case of PTSD, however, while depression symptoms such as memory and concentration can be reversed with the treatment, exaggerated fear is not easily reversed.   a. Name one brain region associated with memory AND propose a mechanism for reversing cellular damage that is directly due to imipramine treatment.  8 pts, no images, 75 word limit

A woman was planning a vacation in a far away city. She was hoping to see a certain popular theatre performance while she was in town, but tickets for the show were sold in person at the theater's box office. She feared that the show would be sold out if she waited to purchase tickets when she arrived in town, so on June 1, the woman mailed a letter to an old friend who lived in the city asking him if he would purchase the tickets for her in exchange for a $100 fee. The friend replied by letter on June 5th that he would do so. But on June 6th, he decided that he didn't feel like waiting in line for the tickets after all so he sent a text to the woman telling her that her request was too much to ask of him and that he would not get the tickets for her. The woman received the friend's text immediately. She was disappointed in her friend's response and did not reply to his text. Still really wanting to see the show, she immediately purchased tickets from an online ticket broker for a $500 fee. On June 7, the woman received her friend's letter. When the woman did not contact her friend again, he began to feel guilty. On June 8, the friend purchased tickets at the box office and then called the woman to let her know. The woman told her friend that the tickets were no longer needed and she would not pay him the $100. Insulted, the friend angrily told the woman that he would sue her for breach of contract. Will the friend be successful in his breach of contract action?

A 42 year old woman comes in for her annual exam.  She is recently divorced after 23 years of marriage and had just started dating someone.  She is hopeful the relationship will become serious and anticipates potentially having a sexual relationship with this person.  She has 3 teenage children (whom she has full custody of) and works full time.  Her menstrual cycles have become somewhat irregular and heavier than in the past.  The bleeding patterns are "annoying"  to her.  She also describes occasional hot flashes, one of which occurred while she was on a date.  This caused embarrassment.  She asks if she really needs to be concerned about contraception given the changes in her cycle and the hot flashes.  She is ambivalent about the loss of fertility.  It seems that not having to worry about pregnancy would be really nice but maybe having another baby would be okay if the right person came along.  She is a nonsmoker, is normotensive, does not take any medication or supplements,  and her BMI is 24.  List 5 areas that you would counsel this woman about based upon the information provided.

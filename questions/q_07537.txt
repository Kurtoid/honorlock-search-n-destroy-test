2.2   'n Wetenskaplike het 'n studie gedoen om vas te stel of  'n  vasektomie (die afsny van die vas deferens) 'n invloed sal he op testosteroonproduksie.  Hy het twaalf volwasse, manlike Reuse Afrika rotte gebruik. Hy het hulle in drie groepe ingedeel. Aan die begin van die eksperiment was al die rotte getoets - almal het dieselfde testikulere gewig, spermtelling, sperm-beweeglikheid en testosteroonvlakke gehad.  'n Vasektomie was gedoen slegs op die regter testes van die rotte in Groep 1 en Groep 2. Hulle linker testes het onbehandeld gebly. Die rotte in Groep 3 het heeltemal onbehandeld gebly.  Na 6 en 8 weke was die testosteroonvlakke in die rotte se bloed getoets. Semen van beide testes was onttrek en geanaliseer. Die resultate word in die tabel hieronder getoon.

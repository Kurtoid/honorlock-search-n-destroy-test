The following table contains the summary statistics after a SRS was taken from each of the areas.

Use the conservative method for degrees of freedom, and do not assume equal variances.       Counties   Sample size   Average lead levels (ug/L, parts per billion)   Sample standard deviation     Control   16   0.4   0.06     Potentially Contaminated   13   9.8   1.2

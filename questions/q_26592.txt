The conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to chorismate is catalyzed by a specific enzyme.  When tyrosine is introduced to a solution containing the enzyme and a saturating concentration of PEP the rate of the reaction decreases.  Adding more PEP partially overcomes the effect of tyrosine on the reaction rate.  Further studies reveal that tyrosine binds to the enzyme at the same location where PEP binds.  Also, it binds reversibly, allowing the enzyme to be fully functional if tyrosine is removed from the solution.  In this situation tyrosine is acting as

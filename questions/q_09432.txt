After meeting with Romdos representatives at its corporate headquarters in California, Univcin agrees to sell Romdos 10 of its current models of computer work stations at $10,000 each. Romdos is unhappy with the machines because they perform sluggishly, they don't have enough useful software, and because they offer really awful graphics. Romdos threatens suit-alleging breach of warranty.  Corporate counsel for both Univcin and Romdos advise their clients that they should pursue alternative dispute resolution to save litigation costs. Which of the following would not qualify as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism?

The formula to compute the kinetic energy is given by: E = 1/2 m v2 where m is the mass in kilograms, v is the velocity in meters/second and energy is given in Joules. Your job will be to write a program that gets the mass and velocity from the keyboard, call a function, that takes in as parameters the mass and velocity, to compute and return the kinetic energy.  The main program will then display that energy using one decimal place. The main program should also write the mass, velocity, and energy to a data file named "energy.txt". The function should return 0 if the mass or the velocity are not positive numbers. Otherwise, it should use the formula given above and return that computed value. Write a complete C++ program to solve the problem.

In Hick's experiments on choice-reaction time, he presented each participant with a fixed set of lights, each with a corresponding button. Every 5 seconds, a light would turn on at random, and Hick measured the time it took for participants to push the button associated with the light. He did this for different numbers of lights (2-10 lights).   A. Calculate the expected information potential (H) of a 2 light setup, a 4 light setup, and a 10 light setup, assuming that each light has an equally likely chance of turning on. Which of these setups has the highest information content? Show all work. (4 pts) B. Hyman was interested in whether the reaction time was due to the number of lights or the amount of information, so he manipulated the probabilities that each of the lights would turn on, but kept the total number of lights fixed. For the two 4 light setups below, calculate H. Which setup has the highest information content and how does it compared to the 4 light setup from part A? Show all work.

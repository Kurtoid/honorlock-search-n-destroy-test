Gardenfine is a firm producing garden soil. No other firms can produce it because Gardenfine controls the supply of garden soil. It costs $3,000 to set up its production facility and an additional $6 to produce each bag of garden soil. The demand curve for the garden soil is: Q(P) = 3000 - 100P where P is the price of the garden soil and Q is the quantity demanded (bag) of garden soil at price P. (a) Find this firm's total cost, average total cost, and average variable cost. (b) Find the slope, x-intercept, and y-intercept of the inverse demand curve. (c) Find the slope, x-intercept, and y-intercept of the marginal revenue curve. (d) Find the profit-maximizing quantity that Gardenfine will produce, corresponding market price, and the total profit. (e) Is this profit-maximizing point Pareto efficient? Explain. (f) Suppose Gardenfine employs salespeople who are able to determine the willingness to pay of every customer. What quantity and market price of garden soil will Gardenfine sell now?

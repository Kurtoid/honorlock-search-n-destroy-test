29.  Discussion Question:  10 points.   Imagine that Jesse has promised a friend that he will pick her up from the airport when she arrives in town.  Her flight is arriving soon, and Jesse is getting ready to pick her up, when he suddenly gets a pone call about an exciting job opportunity.  Jesse has been looking for a new job for some time, and this one would be particularly good for him in a variety of ways.  However, there's a catch- the job needs to be filled right away, and so if he cannot come in right now and interview for it, it will go to someone else.  Jesus knows it is strongly in his interest for him to go to the interview but also that doing so would mean breaking a promise.  He also knows that whether or not he keeps his promise makes a relatively minor difference in his friend's life compared to the difference in his life if he gets the job.   Is this a case of conflict between moral duty and self-interest?  Do you think Kant was right that moral duty always overrides other demands?  Why or why not?

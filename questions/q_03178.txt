Nucleic acids are the types of molecules used as coding instructions for all living organisms, except for bacteria.
In a population of 100 diploid clams, two alleles at a single locus control the ability to detoxify bacterial contaminants. The allele D codes for an enzyme that can detoxify the contaminant and is completely dominant to d, which codes for a nonfunctional form of the enzyme. In a population of clams, you find 84 individuals that can detoxify and 16 that cannot. The total number of alleles in the gene pool of this population is [blank1] and the frequency of the recessive allele is [blank2]. Assuming that this population remains in Hardy Wienberg equilibrium, the expected frequency of clams that can detoxify the bacterial contaminants is [blank3]

A hexapeptide that is part of a mouse hormone was hydrolyzed to give the following amino acids (in no particular order): Tyr (Y), Cys (C), Glu (E), Ile (I), Lys (K), Met (M).  a) two cycles of Edman degradation of the intact hexapeptide releases the PTH-amino acids below. Remember that the Edman reagent reacts with the N-terminus amino acid and cleaves it off as a cyclic structure (PTH), where only the R group of the amino acid is recognizable.  b) cleaving the intact hexapeptide with cyanogen bromide yields Met and a pentapeptide c) treating the intact hexapeptide with trypsin yields a dipeptide, which contains Tyr and Glu, and a tetrapeptide d) when the intact hexapeptide is treated with carboxypeptidase A, a Tyr residue and a pentapeptide are produced.  Write the sequence of the hexapeptide in the blank below.

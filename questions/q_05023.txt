Researchers investigating the regulation of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic neurons proposed a model (Figure 1) in which CDK5, a protein expressed in axon terminals, inhibits the movement of synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic membrane. To test their model, the researchers used a modified version of green fluorescent protein . In slightly alkaline conditions, GFP exhibits a bright green fluorescence. In acidic conditions GFP  exhibits no fluorescence. Using standard techniques, the gene encoding GFP is easily introduced into living cells. By engineering the expression of GFP in laboratory-cultured nerve cells, the researchers found that a bright green fluorescence was exhibited only when a presynaptic neuron was given a certain stimulus.   Based on the model, which of the following best explains how regulation of neurotransmitter release might increase the range of responses to a stimulus in the nervous system?

It is hypothesized that early photosynthesis was anoxygenic. Think about the role of oxygen in photosynthesis as carried out by green plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria (as opposed to modern organisms that use anoxygenic photosynthesis). What would have been different in anoxygenic photosynthesis (or is different in modern organisms that use anoxygenic photosynthesis)?

Use the standard reaction enthalpies given below to determine DHdegrxn for the following reaction:             4 NO(g) + 2 O2(g)  -  4 NO2(g)        DHdegrxn =  ? Given:             N2(g) + O2(g)  -  2 NO(g)                 DHdegrxn = +183 kJ              1/2 N2(g) + O2(g)  -  NO2(g)           DHdegrxn = +33 kJ

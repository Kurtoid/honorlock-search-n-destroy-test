The bond enthalpy of the Br-Cl bond is equal to DHdegrxn for the following reaction.       BrCl(g) - Br(g) + Cl(g)       Using the following data, what is the bond enthalpy of the Br-Cl bond?       Br2(l) - Br2(g) DHdegrxn = 30.91 kJ/mol   Br2(g) - 2Br(g) DHdegrxn = 192.9 kJ/mol   Cl2(g) - 2Cl(g) DHdegrxn = 243.4 kJ/mol   Br2(l) + Cl2(g) - 2BrCl(g) DHdegrxn = 29.2 kJ/mol

Use System Verilog, don't use datatype reg, use always_comb and always_ff as appropriate for always blocks. Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables. Instantiate the multiplexer in problem 1a) to answer this question. Problem 1b)  Write a module which adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides the inputs Aluin_a, and Aluin_b using operands +, -, * and /. Opcode 2'b00 should add, 2'b01 subtract, 2'b10 multiply and 2'b11 divide.  (Hint, add is Aluin_a+Aluin_b, subtract is Aluin_a-Aluin_b, multiply is Aluin_a*Aluin_b, and divide is Aluin_a/Aluin_b) Module inputs should be Aluin_a, Aluin_b, Opcode, and output should be Result. You can make them all the same width Size which does make assumption that there is no overflow. (If you make the output twice as wide you can handle overflow for extra credit, but it will involve some extra steps, and you may have to customize 1a to accomplish this) For full credit, instantiate the multiplexer from 1a) to perform these arithmetic functions.

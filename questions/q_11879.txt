"Are we prepared for so stubborn a fight as a future war involving the great powers of Europe will undoubtedly become? The answer, we must say without evasion, is no. In addition to the military considerations, there is also the political angle. It should not be forgotten that Russia and Germany are representatives of the conservative principle in the civilized world, as opposed to the democratic principle represented by England and France. From this point of view, a war between Russia and Germany, regardless of the specific issues over which it is fought, is profoundly undesirable to both sides. Such a conflict, however it ends, would entail the weakening of the conservative principle of which the two powers are the only reliable bulwarks. Moreover, one must realize that, under the precarious conditions that now exist, a general European war is mortally dangerous to both Russia and Germany, no matter who wins. It is my firm conviction, based on long and careful study of the multitude of subversive tendencies and movements that we are presently facing, that there must inevitably break out in the defeated country a social revolution that, by the very nature of these things, will inevitably spread to the country of the victor. In our country today, there are countless agitators telling the peasant that he should demand a gratuitous share of somebody else's land, or the worker that he should be getting hold of the entire capital and profits of the manufacturer. War with Germany will create exceptionally favorable conditions for such agitations." Pyotr Durnovo, Russian Minister of the Interior, memorandum to Tsar Nicholas II, February 1914            Which development during the first decade of the twentieth century can best be explained in the context of the "weakening of the conservative principle" mentioned in the first paragraph of the passage?
MINI-CASE STUDY - Blood  Harold is a 67-year-old male who has had regular physical exams, is a non-smoker, and has been in good health for most of his life. In recent years, he has been experiencing symptoms of heartburn, nausea, and indigestion after eating certain foods. Although he experienced some relief after changing his diet to avoid those foods, the symptoms did not completely subside. Harold was eventually diagnosed with having a form of chronic atrophic gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining). During Harold's most recent visit to the doctor, he complained that he had become progressively more fatigued at the end of his workday. Difficult tasks would take an enormous amount of effort to complete, while simple tasks would make him dizzy and short of breath. He told his doctor that last month he had a period where he suffered frequent headaches and had difficulty sleeping. In obtaining Harold's vital signs, his doctor noted that Harold was experiencing mild tachycardia (an elevated heart rate). His doctor ordered some blood tests including a complete blood count (CBC) and a microscopic examination of a peripheral blood smear. The notable results from these tests, including the blood smear, are provided below. (Harold's blood smear is shown on the left. A normal blood smear is shown on the right.)       Measurement   Result   Range     WBC count   12.1   4.8 - 10.8/ul (x1000)     Neutrophils   8.5   1.1 - 8.3/ul (x1000)     Basophils   1100   0 - 200/ul     RBC count   2.6   4.7 - 6.1 million /ul     Hemoglobin   10.6   13 - 18 g/dl     Hematocrit   31.6   42 - 52 %     *Mean RBC Volume   118.4   80 - 90 fL     Platelets   232   150 - 400/ul      *Also known as mean corpuscular volume or MCV; WBC = White Blood Cell; RBC = Red Blood Cell   A. Which of the following sets of measurements from Harold's CBC does his doctor use to evaluate his body's ability to oxygenate his tissues? [Hemathemorbc]   B. Which of the following sets of measurements from Harold's CBC does his doctor use to evaluate the health of his immune system?  [wbcneutbaso]   C. Doctors have determined that Harold is anemic. Which of the following pieces of evidence directly supports this diagnosis? [fatigue]   D. Based on Harold's history of gastritis, his doctor ordered a blood test in order to measure his levels of vitamin B12. Which of the following explains why his doctor would take this action? [stomachintrinisc]   E. There are many different types of anemia. Based on the evidence in this case, what type of anemia does Harold likely have? [pernicious]   F. Harold's doctor noted that he was experiencing a mild tachycardia. Which of the following best explains why Harold would be experiencing tachycardia in this case? [troubleoxygen]

The following image shows an incident light beam in material 1 striking an interface with material 2. At this interface the light splits, with some (labeled "A") staying in material 1 and some ("B") entering material 2 at a different angle. The angles in the image may not be to scale. Material 1 has an index of refraction of 1.1 and Material 2 has an index of refraction of 1.3. The incident angle is 60deg.     Make your own sketch of the same image, including a label clearly showing the incident angle thi , the reflected angle threflect , and the refracted angle threfract . [3] Find the value of threflect . [2] Find the value of threfract . [4] Is there any angle at which light traveling from Material 1 into Material 2 can be totally internally reflected? You don't have to find the angle itself--just say whether or not it exists. Explain your answer. [2]

Read the case below and respond to the three questions that follow.  Mini-Case The executive committee of XYZ Corporation, a firm in the health care industry, is considering a policy to no longer hire cigarette smokers. (Note: assume the company is operating in a state where such a policy is legal.) Research suggests that there are multiple benefits to such a policy including lower costs for employee health insurance, increased employee productivity, and fewer days lost to employee health concerns. The committee is considering the positive financial implications of such benefits. Further, given that XYZ is in the health care industry, a policy of not hiring smokers may send a positive message to patients and the community. On the other hand, research shows that the prevalence of smoking is higher among certain racial and ethnic groups and among those with lower socioeconomic status. Thus, such a policy may have disproportionate impact on these groups, who are already underrepresented in the health care industry. Further, committee members have raised concerns about writing a policy that regulates employee behavior even when they are off work. Others have noted that smoking is an addiction.   Because of your expertise in business ethics, you have been asked to advise the committee on a course of action.  Based on a case from the National High School Ethics Bowl

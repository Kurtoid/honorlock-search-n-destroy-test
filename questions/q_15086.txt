Genes that code for the proteins that make up the mitochondria are located in the DNA of the nucleus of the host cell and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). A number of mutations in these genes cause serious clinical features in humans such as neurological problems, muscle weakness, exercise-induced cramps and fatigue.

You are assigned the job of building a very sensitive magnetic scale. Objects are hung from a horizontal rod through which an electric current is directed from left to right. The rod is loosely attached to a pair of vertical rails that allow it to slide up and down with almost no resistance. The entire scale is placed in an external magnetic field, and the current is adjusted until the rod and object levitate, balancing the downward gravitational force with an upward magnetic force.  1. In which direction must the external magnetic field point in order for your scale to work? 2. What current is needed to balance the scale if the combined mass of the rod and object is 1 kg, the length of the wire is 1 meter, and the magnitude of the external magnetic field is 0.1 Tesla?

A semiconductor manufacturer produces controllers used in automobile engines. The customer requires that the process proportion defective at a critical manufacturing step to be less than 0.05 and that the manufacturer demonstrate process capability at this level of quality. Can the manufacturer demonstrate process capability for the customer?                                                                       Two chemical companies can supply a raw material to a manufacturer company. The concentration of a particular element in this material is important. The manufacturer wants to know if there is a difference in mean concentration between the two companies.                                 A research engineer for a tire manufacturer is investigating tire life for a new rubber compound and has built 16 tires and tested them to end-of-life in a road test. The sample standard deviation is 3646 kilometers. Can it be concluded, that the standard deviation of tire life is less than 4000?

The water temperature is measured in nine randomly days, and the average temperature is found to be 98oF. Is there evidence that the water temperature is acceptable?

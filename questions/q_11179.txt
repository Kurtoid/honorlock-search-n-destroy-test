A bank wants to use simulation to study its waiting line system. In this problem, you will simulate 7 customers going through the waiting line Assume that the interarrival times and service time probability distributions are given below:       Inter-arrival time (min)   Probability     1   .25     2   .35     3   .3     4   .1         Service time (min)   Probability     1   .35     2   .3     3   .25     4   .1         a. Use the following six random numbers to determine the interarrival time of each of customers 2-7. Inter-arrival time doesn't apply to the first customer.  We will assume that the first customer shows up at the very beginning of the day, time 0. : (6 points) .32, .72, .64, .42, .17, .81   b. Use the following seven random numbers to determine the service time of each of the first seven customers : (6 points) .81, .10, .46, .95, .78, .27, .35   c. Assume there is one teller. Simulate the waiting line system for these first seven customers to determine the waiting time for each customer and the idle time for the server. Create a table with appropriate headers by clicking the table icon in the editing options above.  (13 points)

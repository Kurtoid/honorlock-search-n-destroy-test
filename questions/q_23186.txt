Above is a picture showing the distribution of seed weight over 3 successive generations.  The first column shows seed collected from two field sites (Gopher and East Humboldt; ie. Post selection) as well as the original seed source population from a managed farm (i.e. pre selection).  The black line in the center of each graph indicates the mean seed weight (x). Looking at just the first column (F1, dashed box), what type of selection is at work?    What conclusion can you make about the average mass of seeds after the first generation(F1) (HINT: look at the x in the subsequent generations)?      The second and third column show the size distribution of the seeds after plants were grown in a common garden (same environment for all seed sources) for the second and third generation.

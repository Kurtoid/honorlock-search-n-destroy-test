Case Study #2a Scenario Sara is 22 and has cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that develops when a person inherits two copies of a defective gene for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an ion channel protein. Disease symptoms are caused by an accumulation of viscous and sticky mucous in organs like the lungs and pancreas. However, the most common cause of severe illness and death in people with cystic fibrosis is infection.   Signs and Symptoms Although Sara had weathered several lung infections as a child, she was unprepared for the severity of a new onset of respiratory distress. Her breathing difficulties and coughing up of blood led to a visit to the hospital emergency room. From there she was admitted to the critical care unit. Blood and sputum samples were taken and sent to the microbiology lab for culture.   Testing Several types of bacterial colonies were noted growing on blood agar. After subculturing to new media, one of the bacteria was noted to produce a greenish-colored pigment. This colony was Gram stained and observed at 1000X with a light microscope.  Question What is the bacteriological interpretation of the Gram-stain results?

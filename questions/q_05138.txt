Imagine a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains information about a UMD football game. Each dictionary has the keys "opponent", "umd_points", and "opponent_points". The value of "opponent" is a string; the value of "umd_points" is the number of points UMD scored, expressed as an integer; and the value of "opponent_points" is the number of points the opposing team scored, expressed as an integer. Here is an example of a list of dictionaries matching this description: [ { "opponent": "Rutgers", "umd_points": 48, "opponent_points": 7 },    {       "opponent": "Temple",       "umd_points": 17,       "opponent_points": 20   },    {       "opponent": "Syracuse",       "umd_points": 63,       "opponent_points": 20    },] Write a function that takes a list of dictionaries like the one above as an argument. The function should return a list of opponents from the dictionaries, sorted in decreasing order of UMD's points minus the opponent's points. For the example list above, the function would return ["Syracuse", "Rutgers", "Temple"] because UMD beat Syracuse by 43 points, UMD beat Rutgers by 41 points, and UMD lost to Temple by 3 points. For full credit, your solution should include a list comprehension and a lambda expression.

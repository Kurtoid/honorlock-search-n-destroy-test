A balanced delta connected load of 15 + j18 ohms per phase is connected at the end of a three phase line. The line impedance is 1 + j2 ohms per phase. The line is supplied from a three-phasesource with a line-to-line voltage of 207.85 V rms. Taking Vph as reference, determine the following:(a) Current in phase a.(b) Total complex power supplied from the source.

Davis Company purchased 40% of the outstanding shares of Ocean Corporation on January 1 at a cost of $580,000. Ocean Corporation reported net income of $95,000 and paid total dividends of $25,000 for the year. At the end of the year, Ocean shares had a current market value of $590,000. After all necessary adjusting entries are made for the year, the balance in Davis Company's Long-Term Investment account will be:

In 2016, high winds developed in and near the Foothills and adjacent Plains late Christmas morning and continued into the evening.  A random sample of wind speed observations is provided below: 68    84    51   56   63   66  56   57   76   88   74   57   59   72   74   50    76 a) Compute the sample coefficient of variation. Using the empirical CDF of the sample, compute: b) The sample median. C) The probability that wind speed at a location in the region exceeded 74 mph. d) The 90% quantile of the data. Note: Use the lowest rank to adjust the estimated eCDF values for repeated observations.
The type of unemployment that economists generally associate with normal growth of the labor force and expanding job opportunities in a dynamic economy is:
A MT processor that allows instruction from 2 threads to be run concurrently,  has two functional units, only instructions from a single thread can be issued to run on any cycle. Assume we have two threads X and Y to run on these CPUs that include the following operations:     Thread X   Thread Y     A1 - take 3 cycles to execute A2 - Depends on the results of A1 A3 - no dependences takes 3 cycles to execute A4 - conflicts for a functional unit with A1   B1 - takes 4 cycles to execute B2 - conflicts for a functional unit with B1 B3 -no dependences and takes 2 cycles to execute  B4 - Depends on the result of B2     Assume all instructions take a single cycle to execute unless noted otherwise or they encounter a hazard.  Assume you have one MT CPU, how many cycle it takes to execute these two threads? How many issue slots are wasted due to hazards?

Consider a monopolist with a total cost (TC) given by: TC = 100 + 2Q + 2Q2  where Q is output.  The market demand curve faced by this monopolist is given by: P = 50 - 2Q, where P is price. Please answer below the following three questions:   (a) (6 points) Use the total cost function (TC) stated in the problem to find the average variable (AVC), average (AC), fixed (F), and marginal cost (MC) functions of this monopolist. (b) (7 points) Find the profit maximizing quantity of output for the monopoly and the price the monopolist will sell. Calculate the monopolist's profits. Explain. Here, to obtain full credit, I not only expect you to provide a numerical answer to the question, but also to describe the profit function that the monopolist attempts to maximize and the first order condition of the monopolist's problem (i.e., derivative of profit function with respect to choice variable).

Here, to obtain full credit, I not only expect you to provide a numerical answer to the question, but also to describe the equation for the deadweight loss (i.e., functional form of the equation along with a description of each of its components).

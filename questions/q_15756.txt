Inside, the police saw two individuals seated on the living room sofa, both of them listening to music through headphones. Police approached, explained their presence, and immediately arrested Stanek when she identified herself. The other person on the sofa was Patterson, a good friend of Stanek who told the officers that he had planned to spend the night at Stanek"s house.

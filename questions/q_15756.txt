Write a full program from the includes to the return 0 statement at the end of main that does the following: 1) initialize a vector with 20 random integers (range of 1 to 100). 2) output the values of the vector on one line with each value separated by a space. 3) compute and output the sum of the even index values: 0, 2, 4, 6, etc. 4) compute and output the sum of every other odd index value: 1, 5, 9, 13, etc. 5) compute and output the average of the values in the vector. use a function called average that has the following signature: double average(vector& v) Here is an example of a trial run:  71 11 54 51 63 89 100 4 60 65 2 63 65 77 84 82 87 96 71 14  657 338 60.45

Problem No. 2 Shown below is a diving board that is supported by springs at A and B.   A boy with a mass of 60-kg stands at the free end of the board as shown. The spring constant (stiffness) of both springs k=60 kN/m. The board is assumed to be rigid, i.e. it remain straight at all times (does not curve). Before the boy stepping on the board it was perfectly horizontal. Take g=9.807 m/s^2 and neglect the weight of the board.  Based on this information answer the following question: Question 2.4: What is the change in length of the spring at  A? [Enter value in mm, elongation (upwards) as positive]

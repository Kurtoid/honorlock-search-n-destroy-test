In a population of 100 diploid clams, two alleles at a single locus control the ability to detoxify bacterial contaminants. The allele D codes for an enzyme that can detoxify the contaminant and is completely dominant to d, which codes for a nonfunctional form of the enzyme. In a population of clams, you find 84 individuals that can detoxify and 16 that cannot. The total number of alleles in the gene pool of this population is [blank1] and the frequency of the recessive allele is [blank2]. Assuming that this population remains in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, the expected frequency of clams in the next generation that can detoxify the bacterial contaminants is [blank3]

How and where is ATP made in a eukaryotic cell? A) ATP can be made by direct phosphorylation of ADP in the cytoplasm, and by an enzyme complex that uses the energy from a proton gradient to drive ATP synthesis in the mitochondria. It can also be made in other locations in the cell, depending on the cell type. B) ATP can be made by an enzyme complex that uses the energy of protons moving down their concentration gradient from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytoplasm to make the ATP. C) ATP is made in all compartments of the cell in response to endergonic reactions and is used to drive exergonic reactions in the cell. D) ATP is only made in the mitochondria in response to chemiosmosis.

Skill C2.  (This problem is based on one by Pollock, 1999.)  A casting process produces batches of metal parts; each batch has 100 metal parts.  A manufacturing firm has a customer that wishes to purchase a batch of parts.  The firm must decide whether to accept the order and make the batch; the cost of making the batch is $3,000.  The batch may be "good" or "bad," which the manufacturing firm's inspection department determines before the batch is shipped to the customer.  According to the firm's manufacturing engineer, the probability that the batch will be "bad" equals 0.4.  If the batch is good, then inspection department will say that it is good, and the customer will pay the firm $15,000.  If the manufacturing firm makes a bad batch, the probability that the inspection department will correctly identify the bad batch is 0.75.  If the bad batch is not identified and it is shipped to the customer (because it was not identified), the customer will cancel this order and will pay nothing. If the bad batch is correctly identified before it is shipped, the manufacturing firm must decide whether to make another batch.  If they decide not to make another batch, they must cancel the order, and the customer will pay them nothing.  If they decide to make another batch, that will cost $5,000; on the second try, the batch will certainly be good, but the batch may be delayed, in which case the customer will pay only $14,000 because of the late delivery.  The probability of delay equals 0.3.  If it is not delayed, then the customer will pay the firm $15,000.  Which one of the following decision trees best corresponds to the decision whether to make the batch? A.   B.   C.   D.

Sequence Diagram Exercise (10 points): Develop Sequence Diagram for the following scenario. When a borrower requests for checkout of media, the librarian begins the checkout process by entering the borrower's identification information in the library system. The borrower is located and verified to be valid. For each of the media copy, the librarian then enters media copy information in the library system. Once the media copy is located, the library system then processes that item (i.e., media copy). This process is repeated at the library system for each media copy. During this process, if the number of items exceeds the limit for that borrower, the library system informs the librarian of the same. The librarian checks out only the allowed number of copies to the borrower. If the limit is not exceeded, the library system informs the librarian of the same, and all the requested copies are checked out to the borrower.

Amy entered school and was placed in a classroom for children with hearing loss during part of her day to strengthen her language skills. She spent the rest of her day in the mainstream/inclusion environment with typically developing peers. She is making progress, but is still noticeably behind her peers in her skills. Speech-Language services were provided three times per week. She had two individual sessions for articulation, auditory, and language per her IEP. She also had one session in the classroom environment (i.e. inlcusion; push-in services). Amy's parents requested a team evaluation during her first-grade year to gain input on their daughter's progress and to determine if she was ready to access a regular classroom full-time. The only concern raised by the school was Amy's tendency to "shut down" and avoid responding following some adult requests at school. What areas of assessment do you believe need to be completed?  Who is on your team? What information do you want in order to make a placement decision for Amy?

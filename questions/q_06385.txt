Dear B1408 Lecture Students:  It is mandatory for ALL students to do as instructed below. A portion of the paragraph below was included in the description for this exam and posted as a canvas announcement.  Read or re-read the details below.  List your name in the fill in blank to affirm that you have not violated the Collin College Student Code of Conduct. Remember, maintaining academic integrity is your individual responsibility. You are not allowed to use any resources (textbook, internet, ASP, people, lecture tutorials etc.).  Be advised, as always, I will notice patterns that indicate cheating (I will report any concerns to the Dean of Students office). As stated in the course syllabus, ethical behavior is important in all professions. Ethics and morals relate to right and wrong conduct. Cheating includes the aforementioned details as well as discussions of exam content after you have completed the exam if the exam has not closed. This exam is worth 100 points with 63 questions (you have about 1.6 minutes per question).  If you are fluid (continuously move though the exam without long pauses or stopping -means basically you are not trying to use resources), you have plenty of time to finish the exam. Use the internet as opposed to WIFI when you access the exam if possible to avoid being disconnected while taking the exam. Check and make sure your equipment is operational.  Copying & Pasting any of the content from the exam is prohibited. Additionally, taking images of assessment questions is also not allowed. Use a good browser like firefox etc. Do not send me images of a question or figure etc. To do so is a violation of the aforementioned mandate. A few students have done this and I have advised them that this is a violation. If a student does this after I have reiterated that this is a violation, I will consider it as a flagrant act with a dishonest intent. List your full name below (space to record your name)  as an acknowledgement that you have read  the information above and you affirm that you have not violated CC  ethical code of conduct related to cheating as outlined above

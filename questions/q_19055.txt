A profit-maximizing firm manufactures widgets (Y) using machines (K) and full-time workers (L). In any given week, its output is given by the production function:                                 Y= F (K, L) = 1200K +700L + 2KL - L2 - 2K2                 The marginal product of labor (MPL) is                                                                 MPL = 700 +2K - 2L                 And the marginal product of capital (MPK) is                                                                 MPK = 1200 +2L - 4K The firm operates in perfectly competitive market and product markets. The going price of capital (r) is $1,000 per machine per week. Moreover, the firm sells its output at the going price (p) of $2 per widget. Consider the firm's short run labor demand problem. a) If the current stock of capital is fixed at 200 units, how many full-time workers should the firm employ if the weekly salary of each full-time worker (w) is $200 per week? Compute the firm's level of output and profits per week in this short-run equilibrium. b)  Assuming the capital stock remains fixed at 200 units, what will the firm's short-run labor demand be if the weekly wage (w) increases to $300 per full-time worker? What will the firm's level of output and profits be in this new short-run equilibrium? c) What is the firm's short-run elasticity of labor demand as the wage increases from $200 to $300? Is this elastic or an inelastic response? d) Is this elasticity in line with the female's elasticity of labor demand? Explain your answer.

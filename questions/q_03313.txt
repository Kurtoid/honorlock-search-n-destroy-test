The physician orders tetracycline hydrochloride 0.5 g PO QID. The medication label reads tetracycline hydrochloride 250 mg tablets. The nurse prepares how many tablet(s) to administer?
Figure 3 shows a circuit where registers A-E are all 16 bits, each. Assume: (i) delay of the adder is the same as that of the subtractor; (ii) supply voltage can be reduced to 0.6Vdd if the delay of adder (subtractor) is allowed to be doubled; (iii) capacitance of the computing component (i.e., registers A-D, adder, subtractor) is increased by 20%, if a pipeline stage is added between the adder and subtractor; (iv) the expected (average) number of wires switched between registers D and E is 14, for each data communication between registers D and E. (a) How many percent of computing power can be saved if the component is added one more pipeline stage between the adder and subtractor, with the same circuit throughput? (b) If the bus inverting encoding technique is applied to the communication component between registers D and E, how many percent of communication power can be saved? Assume the extra wire used to indicate inversion status and the extra circuit to perform inversion for each wire consume little power and can be ignored in the power analysis. (c) How many percent of power can be saved if both (a) and (b) are implemented. NOTE: Use [ (X-Y)/X ] x 100/100 where X is P(before adding LP design)  and Y is P(after adding LP design) for computing the percentage of power saving in the above questions.

Extra credit question (2 points; it shows as 0 points in this exam so that Canvas will not count it in the denominator, I will manually add up to 2 points as appropriate when grading so that it will show as extra credit). As we have covered earlier in the quarter, the influenza vaccine and many others you may have gotten typically consist of either proteins representing the pathogen, or an inactivated ("killed") or otherwise "attenuated" (harmless) version of the pathogen.  In response to the vaccine, B lymphocytes of your body produce antibodies that bind specifically to the protein or pathogen. This effectively "trains" your immune system to be able to rapidly and powerfully respond if you are exposed to the actual pathogen, thereby protecting you. A number of the new vaccines currently for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that is causing the global pandemic are instead mRNA vaccines, meaning they consist of RNA sequences of genes from the coronavirus. For example, the ones from Pfizer and Moderna is the mRNA that codes for the viral spike protein, a protein on the surface involved in attachment and uptake by the cell. If classical vaccines rely on the injection of a protein in order for the immune system to respond to produce antibodies that bind that protein, what do you think the mechanism is of this RNA vaccine? In other words, how do you think this RNA vaccine elicits a proper immune response yielding antibody production that will bind and block the coronavirus, as clinical trials thus far have demonstrated it does? What do you think the antibodies bind to on the virus? Please explain briefly but clearly.

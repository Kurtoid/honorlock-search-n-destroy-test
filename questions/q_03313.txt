Case study #2 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is an enveloped retrovirus that has humans as its only reservoir. The spikes on HIV specifically bind to CD4 molecules of specific leukocytes and lymphocytes. After the viral genetic material is reverse transcribed by an enzyme known for its high error rate and poor proofreading, it is integrated into the host cell's chromosome. The virus then enters a period of latency. When activated, viral proteins are made using the same machinery and mechanisms as typical host cell proteins. Rapid viral replication results in the death of the host cell. A person with HIV has progressed to clinical AIDS when CD4 cells fall below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. (The CD4 count of a healthy adult/adolescent ranges from 500 cells/mm3 to 1,200 cells/mm3.)   The genome of HIV is made of _____________ monomers that are covalently linked together.

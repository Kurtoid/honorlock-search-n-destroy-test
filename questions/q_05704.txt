For your final examination, you should write a cohesive, well-developed essay that fully addresses the essay prompt. Please closely read the following CQ Researcher articles (published October 17, 2014 (volume 24, issue 37)) and then the prompt below.     "Protecting the Oceans-Should the United States Open New Areas to Offshore Drilling: Pro"by Andy Radford, Senior Policy Adviser for the American Petroleum Institute   "Protecting the Oceans-Should the United States Open New Areas to Offshore Drilling: Con"by Deval Patrick, Governor of Massachusetts     par. 1The United States has a long and successful history of producing oil and natural gas offshore, but the federal government has largely chosen to restrict activity to the western and central Gulf of Mexico and select areas in Alaska. These restrictions keep 87 percent of federal offshore waters locked away--along with the potential to develop the vast energy resources they contain. par. 2The Interior Department will soon begin developing the government's next five year plan for offshore lease sales, which will take effect in 2017. Decisions made now will have impacts well into the future. par. 3Knowing this, the department should thoroughly analyze the resource-rich areas of interest throughout the entire U.S. Outer Continental Shelf and draft an expansive leasing plan that maintains current leasing areas and seeks to unlock new areas that are currently off-limits, such as the Atlantic and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Including these areas in the next leasing plan would send a signal to the markets and to the world that America's oil and natural gas renaissance is here to stay. par. 4Accessing this bounty is also safer now than ever before. In the last four years, the oil and natural gas industry has worked both independently and with regulators to enhance the safety of offshore operations. As the co-chairs of the [National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling] recently said, offshore development is safer today because industry and the government have enhanced spill prevention, containment and response, revised existing standards and regulations and created new ones and worked hard to foster a strong industry safety culture. par. 5The Center for Offshore Safety in Houston continues to work with companies and the regulators to ingrain safety culture even more deeply into day-to-day operations. And if an incident does occur, state-of-the-art well containment technology can now be rapidly deployed from strategically placed locations. par. 6America's oil and natural gas renaissance has nurtured our economy with good jobs, affordable energy and stable prices, but if we want these benefits to last for the long term, we cannot afford to make short-sighted decisions about our energy future.   par. 1Put simply: the search for and extraction of additional fossil fuels off our coast is inconsistent with Massachusetts' and the Northeast region's policy directions, our binding commitments to greenhouse gas reductions and our leadership in addressing climate change... par. 2Since 2009, my administration has been working closely with [the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] on the planning, siting and analysis of offshore wind in two areas south of Martha's Vineyard. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that these areas have the potential to generate more than 5,000 megawatts of clean, renewable wind energy--enough to power the majority of homes in Massachusetts. Our focus is on continuing this nation-leading work, and any potential exploration or development plans for oil and gas will present a significant distraction and curtail progress for an emerging offshore wind industry at a time when the U.S. is far behind many other nations. par. 3Finally, the waters of the Outer Continental Shelf off Massachusetts contain rich natural resources and important marine ecosystems and habitats that warrant strong protections. The potential impacts from oil and gas development and the calamitous effects of spills cannot justify the risk of moving forward with this industrial activity in the North Atlantic. The scallop and groundfish fisheries around Georges Bank are regarded as the most commercially important fisheries on the Atlantic coast and are critically important to the economies and social fabric of many coastal communities. The scallop fishery off Georges Bank has contributed several billion dollars to the Massachusetts and northeast regional economy in the last decade. par. 4Some of these fish stocks are under great stress. Further impact to the fishery would be devastating to an industry which has already seen enormous cutbacks resulting from federal catch limitations intended to rebuild the fishery. These ocean waters also contain critically important habitat for endangered whales, sea turtles and marine birds. par. 5In summary, Massachusetts does not consider the exploration or extraction of oil and gas off our coast as necessary for the Commonwealth's, the Northeast region's or the nation's energy future or in the best interest of the same. Instead, we need to be focusing our energies and efforts and committing national leadership to a sustainable energy future.     _____________________________________________________________________________________ Topic: Using the above-noted articles, "Protecting the Oceans-Should the United States Open New Areas to Offshore Drilling: Pro" and "Protecting the Oceans-Should the United States Open New Areas to Offshore Drilling: Con," as reference sources, write an essay in which you analyze each author's use of one rhetorical tool or rhetorical appeal to achieve his or her specific purpose.  To start, determine what you believe is each author's specific purpose. Choose one of the following specific purposes for each author: to convince, to justify, to validate, to condemn, to expose, to incite, to celebrate, to defend, or to question. Then, determine which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Pro" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose and then which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Con" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose. You must choose both tools and/or appeals from the following list:    alliteration amplification allusions analogy arrangement/organization authorities/outside sources definitions diction (and/or loaded diction) enthymeme examples facts irony paradox parallelism refutation rhetorical questions statistics testimony tone logos pathos ethos kairos     Organize your ideas into a four-paragraph essay that includes the following paragraphs: (paragraph 1) an introduction paragraph; (paragraphs 2 and 3) two separate, well-developed rhetorical tools and/or rhetorical appeals body paragraphs (one focused on the "Pro" author's use of your chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose and the other focused on the "Con" author's use of your other chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose); and (paragraph 4) a conclusion paragraph. Your essay must include a forecasting thesis statement and effective topic and concluding sentences in each body paragraph. At least four times in your essay, you also must correctly integrate quotations, paraphrases, and/or summaries from the above-noted articles; remember to include proper in-text citations.
In commercial real estate financing, it is common to assume each month has 30 days and each year has 360 days (not surprisingly, this method is called 30/360).  Suppose you are offering a commercial real estate loan to a customer with an APR of 9.00% with DAILY compounding of interest and the 30/360 method.  The loan that requires no money down and MONTHLY payments of $4,000 for five years starting one month from today.  What is the correct interest rate r to use in the annuity formula? [Answers are expressed in decimal form, so if you believe correct answer is 20%, answer below would be 0.200000000]

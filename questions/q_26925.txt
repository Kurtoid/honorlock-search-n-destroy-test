You work for a glass manufacturing company.  The company manufactures three types of glass.  All three glasses have the same composition but different solidification processes.  The glass composition used has a melting temperature of 1000 degC and a glass transition temperature of 500 degC.   The processes are:   Glass #1: Cool from a melt of 1000 degC to 800 degC. Hold at 800 degC for 24 hrs. Then rapidly quench in an oil bath (within seconds) to room temperature.    Glass #2: Cool from a melt of 1000 degC to 900 degC. Hold at 900 degC for 24 hrs. Then rapidly quench in an oil bath (within seconds) to room temperature.    Glass #3: Cool from a melt of 1000 degC to 600 degC. Hold at 600 degC for 24 hrs. Then rapidly quench in an oil bath (within seconds) to room temperature.    Predict the relative mass densities (grams per cm3) from MOST dense to the LEAST dense for these three glasses.
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease. A couple has four children. One develops CF as shown in the pedigree. Their oldest son has molecular testing done on all of the members of the family. Two probes detecting RFLPs very closely linked (flanking) to the CF gene were used to assess the genotypes in this family. The RFLP pattern as seen on a Southern blot is shown below each individual in the pedigree. Choose the correct answer combination for both the questions below: 1. Which of his normal siblings are most likely homozygous normal?  2. From which parent did the oldest son receive the disease allele?

Nick Andrewson uses gas to heat his home. He has accumulated the following information regarding his monthly gas bill and monthly heating degree-days. The heating degree-days value for a month is found by first subtracting the average temperature for each day from 65 degrees and then summing these daily amounts together for the month.     Month   Heating Degree-Days   Gas Bill     February   850   $129     April   300   $ 52      What will be the increase in Nick's monthly gas bill per heating degree-day using the high-low method?

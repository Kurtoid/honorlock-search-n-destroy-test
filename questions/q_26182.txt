The Cerulean City Debt Service Fund accumulates resources to pay its $2 million general obligation debt (originally issued at face value on January 1, 20X1).  The debt is payable in equal annual installments of principal over 10 years with 5% interest on the unpaid principal (interest is paid annually on December 31).  The entire fund balance is classified as assigned.  Required:  Insert a table (use the formatting below as a guide) to prepare the necessary 20X1 journal entry(ies) required to record the following transactions in the Debt Service Fund.  On January 1, 20X1, the City receives a transfer from the General Fund for $400,000. On March 1, 20X1, the City invests $150,000 in Misty Corporation stock. On October 15, 20X1, the City receives a $1,000 dividend from Misty Corporation. On December 31, the debt service payments (both the principal and interest for the year) become due and payable.  The debt service payments are not paid until January 20X2. The City pays 20X1 fiscal agent fees of $5,000. The books are closed for 20X1.  Be sure to label each entry using the lettering above (A-F).

Three charges are arranged as shown below, arranged around a position marked with an "x." One +25 nC charge is 0.03 m above the x, one +25 nC charge is 0.03 m below the x, and one +50 nC charge is 0.03 m to the left of the x. Be sure to consider whether your answer for each part of this question should be a vector or a scalar.     Find the electric potential at the x. [4] Find the electric field at the x. [5] If a +10 nC charge with a mass of 0.01 kg is placed at the x and then released, find its initial acceleration at the moment it is released. [5] If a +10 nC charge with a mass of 0.01 kg is placed at the x and then released, find its final speed when it is infinitely far away from the other charges. [5]
A team of researchers has been evaluating the effects of a new intervention to help people who are re-entering their lives after an addiction treatment residential program. They are concerned with how well participants adjust back to their social lives and work lives, and their overall life satisfaction. They conducted a randomized control experimental study with 58 patients (some of whom were assigned to the treatment group and others to the control group, taking measurements before (Pre-treatment) and after (Post-treatment) the intervention. The table below shows the pre-treatment  and post-treatment scores on three outcome variables for the treatment non-treatment groups.

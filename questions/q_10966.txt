A two-kilogram mass is attached to a spring whose spring constant is 36 N/m. The entire system is submerged in a liquid that imparts a damping force numerically equal to 22 times the instantaneous velocity. Determine the equation of motion if the mass is initially released from a point 3 meters below the equilibrium point with an upward velocity of 5 m/s.
The interquartile range for the data is  10.75  what is the value of the first quartile?

A stabilization pond is to be designed for a community with a population of 3,000 people, to provide secondary treatment. Primary treatment of the wastewater is to be provided. Pertinent design data for the facility are as follows. Solve each problem to determine the design parameters.  Raw wastewater flow rate: 90 gpcd Influent BOD5: 200 mg/L Primary clarifier BOD5 removal: 30% BOD5/Ultimate BOD: 70% of stabilization ponds in parallel: 2 Pond length to width ratio = 3:1 Pond depth: 5 feet Winter operating temperature: 45 degF (=5.56 degC) Algal toxicity factor (f) = 1 Sulfate concentration is less that 500 mg/L; so f'=1 Temperature coefficient (th)= 1.07     (5 pts) Calculate primary clarifier effluent ultimate BOD (L0, unit: mg/L) (Hint: first calculate BOD5 (mg/L)). (5 pts) Determine total stabilization pond volume required (V, unit: ft3) (Hint: C=0.0047) (5 pts) Determine the total stabilization pond surface area (A) required (acres). (Hint: 1 acre = 43,560 ft2). (5 pts) Determine width (ft) of each pond in 5 ft increments. (Hint: each pond has identical width)

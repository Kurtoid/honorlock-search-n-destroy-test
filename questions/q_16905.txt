When adrenaline binds to adrenergic receptors on the surface of a muscle cell, it activates a G protein initiating a signaling pathway where the activated alpha subunit activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing cAMP levels in the cell; the cAMP activates a cAMP dependent kinase that in turn activates enzymes that result in the breakdown of muscle glycogen, thus lowering glycogen levels.  Compared to normal cells being treated with adrenaline, how would the glycogen levels of mutant cells that lack adenylyl cyclase be affected by adrenaline?

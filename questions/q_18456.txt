Since you have a bit of extra time on this exam, this bonus question will be free response. Your answers should be brief but thorough. You have an enzymatic pathway that catalyzes the synthesis of a product "C"                               E1                       E2                                                                  A          [?][?]      B      [?][?]       C       Enzyme 1 (E1) uses substrate A to catalyze the formation of product B, which is needed to make the final product of the pathway, product C. If there is an excess of product C, feedback inhibition can be used to make sure that cellular resources are not being wasted.  a. Explain in one sentence how feedback inhibition works. Explain how product C, acting as an inhibitor, could affect the activity of enzyme 1 (E1), and the events that would follow in each type of inhibition: b. competitive inhibition  c. non-competitive inhibition

German shepherds are very good at agility, yet their handlers rarely win agility competitions because of the domination of Border collies in the sport.  The German shepherd club decides to hold its own agility trial to counter this problem, and 80 shepherds and their handlers compete.  The mean running time for the shepherds on the course is 50 seconds.  Unfortunately, five handlers break the rules and bring their super-fast Border collies to the trial.  All five Border collies finish the course in less than 25 seconds.

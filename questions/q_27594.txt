The data show MD = -2.4 with a variance of SS = 750 for the sample of difference scores. Does hypnosis influence the number of cigarettes that people smoked? Use an a = .05. a. How many tails? What is the IV and DV? (3pts)b. State the null and alternative hypotheses using the appropriate symbols. (2 pts)c. Identify the critical value that will serve as the decision criterion. (1 pt)d. Compute the appropriate test statistic. Show your work and bold, underline, and italicize your final answer. (4 pts)e. State your decision regarding the null hypothesis. (1 pt)f. If appropriate, compute effect size (include formula!). Otherwise state N/A (2 pts)g. Interpret these results. (Remember: use "plain English" and present the relevant statistics and results in APA format.) (3 pts)

You are hired by multi-billionaire Thurston to fly him and his new girlfriend to the mountains in Colorado for a ski trip.

Also, unbeknownst to you, that Air Traffic Controller knows his estranged wife is on the aircraft you are flying into the Aspen Airport.  Outraged and angry at his estranged wife, the Air Traffic Controller intentionally directs your aircraft into the side of a mountain.  Everyone else is killed, except miraculously you are thrown free of the airplane and land unhurt in a snowbank.  You sue the Federal government for the loss of your aircraft, the Air Traffic Controller admits his act, and you will be able to collect under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

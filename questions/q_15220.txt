Bonus Question: Molluscs feed with a rasping __________, used to scrape up food.
Madison Construction produces two products, steel beams and wood beams.  Management desires that its product mix of beams maximize weekly total contribution margin.  Direct labor is limited to 2,500 hours per week and machine hours are limited to 1,000 hours per week.  The maximum demand for steel beams is 95 beams per week; while the maximum demand for wood beams is 100 beams per week.  Other data for the beams appear below.   Additionally, total weekly beam production cannot exceed 175 beams due to storage constraints.     Steel Beams Wood Beams   Contribution margin per beam $220 $150   Direct labor hours per  beam 130 170   Machine hours per beam 80 120    Below is a partially completed linear program model that seeks to optimize (i.e., maximizes weekly total contribution margin) the product mix of steel and wood beams.  Fill in the blanks in the partially completed model below using variables S, W and TCM which are defined as follows as well as the data provided above.  Please note: you are not being asked to solve the model, only to fill in the blanks to properly state the model.  S = number/quantity of steel beams and  W = number/quantity of wood beams and TCM = total contribution margin  The objective function is TCM = $[variable1]S + $[variable2]W  The constraints are:  Direct labor constraint is: [variable3]S + [variable4]W

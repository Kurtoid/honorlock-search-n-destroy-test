Below is a little more information about the two campaigns Zappos is considering for the new season.  Both campaigns are similar in terms of their overall look and feel, but the content within the two campaigns is different.  The ads in campaign 1 (Product-Focus) feature more detail about the new seasonal colors and styles.  The ads in campaign 2 (Brand-Focus) feature more information about why to shop at Zappos and highlight Zappos's brand promise.     The Zappos team uses secondary research to glean insights into the consumer mindset and motivations.  The secondary research indicates that generally, target audiences could have one of three potential motivations for why they would purchase their shoes online: convenience, cost, or better variety.  The secondary research also shows that typically in this industry, the probabilities (or chances) that the consumer purchase is due to one of these three motivations are 0.5, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively.    Additionally, the Zappos team uses the secondary research along with their expertise and industry knowledge to determine the payoffs associated with each decision option and associated consumer motivation.  Below is the expected payoff table, in terms of number of click-throughs to the website for the online ads, for the different online ad campaigns.        Payoff Table - (number of click- throughs)                     States of Nature         Decision   Options:   (s1) Convenience   (s2)  Cost   (s3)  Better Variety      (d1)   Campaign 1: Product-Focus   150,000   100,000   75,000     (d2)   Campaign 2: Brand-Focus   250,000   100,000   25,000     Probability   0.5   0.2   0.3        Assuming the marketing research project would yield perfect information, what is the value of the perfect information for this decision (EVPI)?

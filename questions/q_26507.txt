Re: A social work researcher, Graciela Ortiz, with a strong interest in ecology and environmental justice hypothesizes a connection between access to community green spaces and time spent outdoors on the one hand, and symptoms of stress and depression among urban dwellers on the other hand.  Examining data from a crossectional  large-scale population study, Dr. Ortiz discovers a significant inverse relationship between symptoms of stress/depression and access to and use of green spaces. Encouraged by this finding, Dr. Ortiz develops a study to test out a program consisting of outdoors/nature activities (Natural Me Program) for adults in a low-income, diverse community in Milwaukee who screen as having mild or moderate depressive symptoms. ---------------------------------------------------------------- Contrary to expectations, at 6 months, participants in the pilot Natural Me program (n=40) as a whole group did not score differently on depression symptoms relative to a comparison group of similar adults who did not participate in this program. However, when analyzing the findings for only participants with mild depressive symptoms at baseline (excluding people with moderate symptoms), the findings showed a statistically significant difference in symptoms (p=.04) between these program participants (n=24) and non-participants with comparable levels of depression symptoms. What would be the most ethical approach to reporting and publishing the findings of the Natural Me study?

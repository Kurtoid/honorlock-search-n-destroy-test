Document 2 - Expert's Letter 6th April 2021 Dear Ms Arch  'Blue Print of the Future' by Julio De Diego Thank you for asking me to review the work that you purchased, purportedly by the renowned oil impressionist Julio De Diego. I am sorry to confirm that the work you bought is not genuine, as I think is fairly obvious. I am familiar with De Diego's work, but it does not take any specific experience of him, or particular expertise, to be able to confirm that the print you bought is not genuine. I would comment that; -  Copies of original artwork are typically flat and smooth, which is yours is not; and Photo-mechanical copies can often have a "dot matrix pattern" which is visible under magnification, which I can see that your copy does. This means it is not an original painting.  I would estimate the value of the print that you have bought to be in the region of PS200.00, on the basis that whilst it was fairly widely available at one time I think it has been out of print for a long while so it would retain some value to anyone who is a collector of De Diego prints. Yours sincerely Lucille DeGrille (Ms) 'Art is in the Heart'

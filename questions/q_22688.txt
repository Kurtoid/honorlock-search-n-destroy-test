Photosynthesis is the process by which organisms such as green plants, algae, and cyanobacteria convert light energy from the sun to chemical energy stored in the bonds of carbohydrates. Chlorophyll is a pigment employed by many autotrophic organisms to absorb the various wavelengths of visible light from the sun for use in photosynthesis. A variety of photosynthetic pigments exist; they are specifically adapted for absorbing different ranges of the visible light spectrum and reflecting others. The absorption spectrum of chlorophyll and accessory pigments can be obtained through spectrophotometry and later used to gain insight into plant growth, determine the abundance of photosynthetic organisms in fresh- or saltwater, and evaluate water quality. The data in Figure 11.1 and Table 11.2 were collected by students measuring the absorption spectra of three commonly encountered photosynthetic pigments.   Using the information in Table 11.2, which of the following wavelengths of light would phycocyanin, a pale blue-colored accessory pigment, absorb LEAST?

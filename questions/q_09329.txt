Refer to the image below.  In the blank area below the image, type the following:   a: name of vertebra shown in panel a (at the top).  Be specific; give just one name if it has 2 different names. B: bone marking name (opening)  c: name of vertebra shown in panel c (at the bottom).  Be specific; give just one name if it has 2 different names.   You MUST type "A, B, C... etc" before each individual answer to get full credit.  For bone marking names, you do NOT need to give the name of the bone that the marking is on; you only need to give the name of the bone marking itself. You do need to give full names, however, to get full points.  For example, "olecranon" will only get you partial credit; "olecranon fossa" will get you full credit. Do your best with spelling.  Words spelled poorly will not receive full credit if instructor cannot identify the term based on how it is spelled.  Ignore the black lines that are not associated with a letter.  Each name is worth 2 points.

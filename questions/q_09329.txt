As your first assignment, your boss has asked you to complete a valuation of Alpine Manufacturing Company (AMC).  Another research analyst has already completed research, done preliminary analysis and made all of the necessary assumptions to complete the business valuation of AMC.  Such analysis and assumptions are as follows: The historical (2020) Free Cash Flow (available to all capital) for AMC is as follows (dollars are in 000's):    Net Sales 10,300.0    COGS 6,200.0   Gross Margin 4,100.0    SG&A, excluding depreciation 1,300.0    Depreciation 560.0   EBIT 2,240.0   Taxes 580.0   Add back: Depreciation 430.0   Cash Flow from Operations 2,090.0   NWC Requirements 1,030.0   Change in NWC 84.0   Capital Expenditures 635.0   Free Cash Flow 1,371.0    The relevant assumptions required to project AMC's FCF for the next 4 years (2021 through 2024) are as follows:  Net sales growth is projected to be 7% in 2021, 5% in 2022 and 2023, and 4% in 2024 Gross margin as a % of sales is projected to be 35% for the 4 year period SG&A (excluding depreciation) as a % of sales is projected to be 12% for the 4 year period Depreciation as a % of sales is projected to be 5% for the 4 year period The marginal tax rate is projected to be 25% for the 4 year period Net working capital (NWC) requirements as a % of sales is projected to be 10% for the 4 year period Capital expenditures as a % of sales is projected to be 7% for the 4 year period  With regard to calculating WACC, the following information has been provided to you regarding AMC:  AMC's current market value capital structure is: 42% debt, 6% preferred and 52% common AMC's anticipated target capital structure is: 50% debt, 5% preferred and 45% common AMC's cost of debt is 6% (before tax) and cost of preferred is 11% - both of which represent its current actual costs and approximate the cost of issuing new securities AMC's beta is 1.3 The appropriate risk free rate is 3.5% and market risk premium is 6.5% (per the Ibbotson Valuation Yearbook)  ___________________________________ Based upon the above information, answer the following (show all work):  Calculate the cost of common equity and the WACC for AMC (note calculating the cost of common equity requires you to unlever and re-lever the AMC beta). Prepare a Free Cash Flow (FCF) for AMC for the years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. Calculate a terminal value (using the 2024 FCF) and assuming the FCF will grow at a rate of 3% (of 2024 FCF) for all future years subsequent to 2024. Calculate the business (enterprise) value, common equity value, and per share common equity value of AMC as of 12/31/20 - note that as of 12/31/20, AMC has $10.020 million of debt, $1.150 million of preferred and 310.0 million shares of common stock currently outstanding.

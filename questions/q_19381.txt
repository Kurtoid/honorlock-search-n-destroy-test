A randomised and double-blinded study compared vitamin C supplements vs placebo in 200 patients with recurrent UTIs. The risk of patients reporting UTIs was 0.16 in the treatment group and 0.2 in the placebo group. Calculate the percentage relative risk reduction (RRR) for UTI in the treatment group. Give your answer as a %.   ARC = the absolute risk of events in the control groupART = the absolute risk of events in the treatment groupARR (absolute risk reduction) = ARC - ARTRRR (relative risk reduction) = (ARC - ART) / ARC

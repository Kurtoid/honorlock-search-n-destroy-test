Police developed probable cause to arrest Stanek for theft. They also had probable cause to search her home for the stolen item, namely a valuable pendant inscribed, "To Jo." Police secured a search warrant but elected not to get an arrest warrant. Police went to Stanek"s house, and upon knocking and announcing themselves, let themselves in after no one answered the door after several minutes. Inside, the police saw two individuals seated on the living room sofa, both of them listening to music through headphones. Police approached, explained their presence, and immediately arrested Stanek when she identified herself. The other person on the sofa was Patterson, a good friend of Stanek who told the officers that he had planned to spend the night at Stanek"s house. One officer then searched Stanek and found the pendant inside her pants pocket. Another officer searched the area around the living room sofa and recovered an unregistered gun in a closed drawer of the coffee table. After finding this gun, the police also arrested Patterson. Then they searched the adjacent rooms. They found Patterson"s shaving kit in an upstairs dresser bureau and, inside the shaving kit, they found a plastic bag containing marijuana.

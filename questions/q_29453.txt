3.  Arrivals of Type X parts occur according to a Poisson process at a mean rate of 4 per hour.  Arrivals of Type Y parts occur according to a Poisson process such that the mean inter-arrival time is 32 minutes.  Assume you are creating a Simio program using a single source to generate both Type X parts and Type Y parts and then randomly assign either a Type X designation or a Type Y designation to each entity as the entity leaves the source.  a.  Using Simio syntax, what do you write for the "Interarrival Time" property on the Source for parts assuming the time units are minutes?  [interarrivals] b.  What is the probability that an arriving entity will be a Type X part?  [probability]

Problem 2 Reynolds, Inc., a manufacturer of industrial scales and laboratory equipment, wants to investigate the relationship between length of employment of their salespeople and the number of electronic laboratory scales sold. In the first model, the managers consider a simple first-order model studying the effect of Experience on Sales.Where:Sales = number of electronic laboratory scales sold.Experience = number of months the salesperson has been employed.The following table shows the Excel output for this model (refer to this output as model 1).  The managers at Reynold's, Inc., believe that sales increases rapidly with any increase in experience. In other words, they suspect that the relationship between these variables may not be linear. Hence, the original model is modified by adding a squared term of the Experience variable. The following table shows the Excel output for this new model (refer this output as model 2).  Are the managers correct in their belief about the non-linear relationship? Justify your answer.

Allen has recently become friends with Cade and Jake. Allen isn't comfortable with their involvement in criminal activities, but he thinks they are cool and values being friends with them. When Cade and Jake tell him that they are going to do an armed robbery of a jewelry store and need his help, Allen reluctantly agrees. Allen's job is to walk in and hand the storeowner a note stating, "If you don't do anything stupid, we will let you live." Then the other two will come in and complete the robbery. Just before Allen is going to enter the store, he changes his mind and tells Cade and Jake that he can't do it. Cade then holds a gun to Allen's head and says, "You better read that note yourself." Still shaking, Allen goes inside the store and hands the storeowner the note. As Cade and Jake rush into the store, however, the burglar alarm goes off. All three run out, but they are soon apprehended. Does Allen have a valid defense of duress under the Model Penal Code (MPC SS 2.09)?

If Product J were processed further, the separable costs would be $9,000 and the final total sales value would be $60,000. For Product K, 6,000 units are produced having a total sales value at splitoff of $30,000. If Product K were processed further, the separable costs would be $3,000 and the final total sales value would be $36,000. Using the sales value at splitoff method, the portion of the total joint costs allocated to Product J is $27,000. The total joint costs are:

Integrative 2 Rainey, a Chicago native, is a big fan of major league baseball.  She regularly attends home games of her beloved Cubs, but also loves to watch reruns of classic games on cable sports channels.  Rainey realizes that watching old games on TV is fairly unusual, but wonders whether more people are watching classic games due to the COVID-19 pandemic, when no live baseball games are being played. Rainey surveys a sample of 38 baseball fans.  They report they are currently watching a mean of 7.6 hours of classic baseball games per week, with a standard deviation of 3.8.  From viewer survey records kept by a major cable sports network, Rainey finds out that the average number of hours per week watched from a population of baseball fans is mu = 5.2. Test whether the COVID-19 pandemic is linked to a significant increase in the number of hours fans watch classic games.  Use an alpha of .05. a.

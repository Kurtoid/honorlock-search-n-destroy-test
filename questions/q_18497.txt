Osmoreceptors are capable of detecting water concentration and are located on the hypothalamus next to the circulatory system. The hypothalamus (part of the brain) sends chemical messages to the pituitary gland next to it. The pituitary gland secretes anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), which targets the kidney responsible for maintaining water levels. When the hormone reaches the kidney, it alters the tubules of the kidney to become more / less permeable to water. If more water is required in the blood stream, high concentrations of ADH make the tubules more permeable. If less water is required in the blood stream, low concentrations of ADH make the tubules less permeable. This process is shown in the diagram below:

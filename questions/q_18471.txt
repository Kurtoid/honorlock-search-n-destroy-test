Use the tiles worksheet (in the data file provided for the exam). The company makes tiles for residential and commercial use (walls and floors). They produce three different grades of tile, each of which requires different amounts of materials and generates different contributions to profit.  Each week, the company receives raw material shipments, and the operations manager must schedule the plant to efficiently use the raw materials to maximize profitability. Because demand varies for the different grades, the marketing department estimates that at most 6,000 square feet of grade III tiles should be produced, and that at least 2,000 square feet of grade I tiles are required. Each square foot of tile weighs 2 pounds -- meaning that each square foot of tile needs 2 pounds of raw material.  Construct and solve an optimization model to determine how many square feet of each grade of tile the company should make next week in order to maximize profit contribution.  The square feet of tiles should be a whole number.   What is the maximum Total Profit?

The firm charges all customers the same price per dose. Demand for Medicine is given by the equation WTP = $90 - $10Q. PharmaCorp incurs a fixed cost of $50 inventing the medicine and a unit cost of $20 per dose, so its cost is given the equation C(Q) = $50 + $20Q. The table below presents consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP), the monopolist's total cost (C(Q)), average cost (AC), marginal cost (MC), total revenue (R), and marginal revenue (MR).  If the price is $50, PharmaCorp will sell ___ doses; if the price is $20, it will sell ___ doses. (Assume that a customer will purchase a dose of medicine if their WTP exactly equals the price.)

An entrepreneur purchased a boutique by taking out a $200,000 mortgage. After a year, she sold the boutique to a businesswoman. According to the terms of the agreement signed by the parties, the businesswoman took the boutique "subject to the mortgage" and agreed to "assume payment of" the mortgage. Shortly thereafter, a popular shopping center opened in the same town and the businesswoman found herself in financial trouble with the boutique. The businesswoman sold the boutique to an investor who prided himself on turning around struggling businesses. Under the terms of the agreement signed by the parties, the investor agreed to take "subject to the mortgage." All deeds and the mortgage were properly recorded. After three months, the investor concluded he could not save this business and stopped making mortgage payments. The bank that held the mortgage demanded payments from the investor, the businesswoman, and the entrepreneur, but none of them paid any money to the bank. The bank properly instituted foreclosure proceedings, and the boutique was put up for judicial sale. The new shopping mall had caused the value of smaller retail space in the town to plummet and the boutique sold for only $90,000. After the $90,000 was applied to the mortgage, $80,000 was still owing on the principal amount. The bank can seek to recover the deficiency from which of the following parties?

Read the poem (used for all poetry questions) and answer the question that follows. My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130) By: William Shakespeare 1 My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; 2 Coral is far more red than her lips' red; 3 If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; 4 If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. 5 I have seen roses damasked, red and white, 6 But no such roses see I in her cheeks; 7 And in some perfumes is there more delight 8 Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. 9 I love to hear her speak, yet well I know 10 That music hath a far more pleasing sound; 11 I grant I never saw a goddess go; 12 My mistress when she walks treads on the ground. 13     And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare 14     As any she belied with false compare.

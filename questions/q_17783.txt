Four small bags are filled with a 10% starch solution. The bag's membrane contains microscopic pores large enough to let smaller water molecules cross but not the larger starch molecules. Bag 1 is placed in a beaker of distilled water (0% starch). Bag 2 is placed in a beaker containing a 5% starch solution. Bag 3 is placed in a beaker of 10% starch solution and bag 4 is placed in a 50% starch solution beaker.Bag 1: 10% starch / Beaker 1: 0% starchBag 2: 10% starch / Beaker 2: 5% starchBag 3: 10% starch / Beaker 3: 10% starchBag 4: 10% starch / Beaker 4: 50% starchThe bags are weighed initially and at regular intervals for a specific period of time. Some bags saw a change in weight, some did not. Answer the following questions based on the expected outcomes of this experiment.Your red blood cells behave in a similar manner as the bags in this experiment. What might happen to your red blood cells if you were suddenly unable to regulate the solute concentration of your blood and it began to rise?
Which type of bilirubin is increased with hepatocellular disease or hepatocyte destruction?

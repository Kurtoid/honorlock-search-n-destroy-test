EXTRA CREDIT - The bloody CE 680 Martyrdom of Hussein occurred in and thus the Shi'ite branch of Islam was founded in present-day southeastern _____, making Shi'ite Arabs the largest ethnic group there. Suppressed and sometimes massacred by minority Sunni Arab group/Baathist Party dictator Saddam Hussein, they were itching to take violent revenge if he ever were to fall - something that our 41st president understood in 1991 but our 43rd president did not in 2003. 1 point

Choose two of the following quotes. In two separate 3 to 4 paragraph essays (one for each quote you choose), discuss the meaning and validity of the quote in the context of the course, and its applicability in companies and industries, using examples.  "Being a pioneer is a sucker's game. The shrewd strategy is to be a fast follower."  "Licensing is for fools and the faint of heart. It always involves leaving money on the table compared to bringing products (in which the technology is embedded) to the market."  "Incumbent firms always protect their base revenues ("anti-cannibalization") and this cripples their ability to innovate."  OR "The anti-cannibalization instincts of incumbent firms are their Achilles heel."    "The industrial world is long gone - physical and financial assets are no longer ascendant. The assets that really matter today are all intangibles, and without intellectual property protection, their value cannot be realized."  "One can never keep imitators at bay - absent strong patents."  Outline the limits to Professor Kathleen Eisenhardt's Simple Rules. When is reasoning from First Principles (as Elon Musk has defined them) a better guide?  In the dynamic capabilities framework, a good deal of emphasis is placed on the important of the top management team and the quality of their decisions. Is this emphasis correct? Isn't middle management critical too?  Discuss from a management and an investment perspective: "Financial accounting standards ignore the intangible assets that matter... "goodwill" is a red herring and should be either redefined or eliminated."  Discuss: "Porter's Five Forces framework is still an essential tool, which is why it is widely used. Dynamic Capabilities is merely a footnote."

[Be sure to show all work.  When doing calculations, start with the symbolic equation(s) from the equation sheet, written down just as they are on the equation sheet and then progressing from there to a solution.] A plane lands on a runway and travels for 1.50 s at a constant speed of 88.0 m/s before the pilot begins to slow the plane down at a constant rate of 5.00 m/s2.  a) Draw a motion diagram that represents all of the plane's time on the runway.  [You will upload this at the end of the exam.] b) Will the plane still be moving when it gets to the end of the 800-m long runway? [Enter your answer below and upload your written out calculations and explanation after the exam.] c) If the plane is still moving at the end of the runway, calculate what the minimum acceleration would need to have been to get the plane to stop in time.  If the plane was not moving at the end of the runway, calculate how much extra runway space it had. [Enter your answer below and upload your written out calculations after the exam.]
DOCUMENTATION Below, some relevant documentation is provided through both external and internal links. The external links are meant to provide access to a more complete version of the relevant documentation, whereas the internal links are meant to provide access to a minimal amount of documentation, so that the relevant content may hopefully be loaded more quickly. (Also, it was not possible to provide a reliable external link for some documentation. For such documentation, an internal link is provided.) When accessing documentation via an external link, another tab should be opened within your web browser. It is likely that you will need to use a keyboard shortcut to switch between multiple open tabs. The keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+Tab" should rotate the active tab to the right, and "Ctrl+Shift+Tab" should rotate the active tab to the left. If these keyboard shortcuts do not work for you, contact some relevant course staff member(s). When accessing documentation via an internal link, select the down arrow () and then select "Preview".  To search for some keyword within some document, select anything within the relevant window and type "Ctrl+f" (or "Cmd+f", if MacOS is utilized) on the connected keyboard.

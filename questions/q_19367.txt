A semi-tractor-trailer truck consists of a tractor unit (mtractor=8,000 kg) and two semi-trailers to carry freight (mtrailer=10,000 kg). The tractor is capable of exerting 7.00 x 105 N force on the road to accelerate the truck forward. What is the maximum amount of cargo (in kg) that can be added to the truck so that the truck will be able to move up a hill with 20o of inclination? Consider that the truck is stationary.   Useful information: The static friction coefficient between the truck and a dry road is mS=0.9 The kinetic friction coefficient of the truck on a dry road is mK=0.7 The surface area of the front of the truck is A=10m2 The drag coefficient of the truck is C=35.5 The density of the air is r =1.21 kg/m3

Question 4 d - distribution selection A cosmetology school runs a hair salon that is staffed by students and is very popular because of their low prices.  Students working at the salon are classified as underclassmen or upperclassmen, and 65% of the student employees are upperclassmen.  Each customer is randomly assigned a stylist when they arrive for an appointment. At the end of each appointment, the customer completes a short survey and provides a rating out of 5 stars (where 1 is low and 5 is high) for the service they received.  The pmfs of the ratings received by upperclassmen and underclassmen over the past year are given below.       Underclassmen           Upperclassment         Probability   Score       Probability   Score     0.15   1 star       0.05   1 star     0.10   2 stars       0.10   2 stars     0.25   3 stars       0.20   3 stars     0.40   4 stars       0.40   4 stars     0.10   5 stars       0.25   5 stars       d) Franklin is an upperclassman stylist.

Consider a single-span greenhouse with measuring 60 feet wide and 150 feet length. Fans are installed along the length of the greenhouse. The greenhouse is located at an elevation of 1000 feet. The maximum PPFD in the greenhouse is 7000 f.c.. A 4 oF rise in temperature can be tolerated from pad to fans. Determine the rate of air removal for the fan-and-pad cooling system.    Tables: Elevation (ft)    Light intensity (f.c.)       Temperature rise (degree F)    Correction factor (pad-to-fan distance, ft)    Formulas:   Standard cfm = L * W * 8  Fhouse = Fele * Flight * Ftemp   Total cfm = standard cfm * (Fhouse or Fvel)

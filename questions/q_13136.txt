Midea manufactures microwave ovens in Shunde, China (>80% of the world's microwave ovens are made in that city), loads them on 40 ft ocean containers and ships them to the US and other markets around the world. Midea manufactures  three main types of microwave ovens  Countertop microwaves are designed for smaller apartment kitchens, offices and hotel rooms Integrated Exhaust Microwaves are designed to fit above the stove and integrate with the exhaust fan for the stove In-Cabinet microwaves are the largest type. They are typically sold in combination with wall-mounted ovens, steamers, etc.    Table 1: Details of microwaves destined for the US market     Cost/unit % of units sold lbs/unit cu ft/unit   Countertop $100 60% 16 2   Int. Exhaust $300 20% 50 6   In-Cabinet $800 20% 100 11    You can download this table in Excel here. The factory in Shunde loads microwaves into 40 foot ocean containers and ships them in mixed containers to the US distribution center in City of Industry, CA. A 40 foot ocean container can hold up to 2,300 cubic feet and up to 44,000 lbs. Ignoring the details of wasted container space caused by the challenge of loading boxes, how should Midea load a 40 foot container in Shunde destined for the US market in order to minimize transportation costs while keeping cycle inventories reasonable.

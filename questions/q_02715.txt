A civil engineer wanted the water to drain away from his completed construction project, so the design of the project needed to include the creation of a slope/angle away from the project.  The engineer was also concerned that with a slope significant soil erosion that might occur.  Soil erosion is the washing away of soil caused by water flow over its surface.   He designed an experiment in which he set up 5 trays with equal amounts of the same type of dry soil at different slopes.  He poured an equal amount of water over each tray, simulating rainfall that would be normal for the area.  He then collected, dried and weighed the amount of soil that ran off of each tray.  He repeated the experiment several times. The following is a data table showing the average of the results of his experiment.     Tray   Slope/Angle   Soil Runoff (g)     1   0o   0 g     2   10o   8 g     3   20o   12 g     4   30o   50 g     5   40o   65 g       Write a hypothesis for this experiment.

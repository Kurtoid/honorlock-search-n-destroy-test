The picture here will be used for problem 6a-6d. For each question I will give you a situation and you need to choose whether the average induced current will be in the clockwise direction, the counter clockwise direction or if the average induced current is 0. For all cases the magnetic field described in the problem is ONLY present inside the square loop. It does not exist outside the loop. The magnetic field will also have the same magnitude everywhere in the loop. Assume the change is happening smoothly over a period of time. You do not need to show your work, just write down your answer clearly indicating which part you are answering. Each part is 3 points each.  6a) The magnetic field is in the +z direction and has its magnitude increased by a factor of 3. 6b) The magnetic field is in the -z direction and rotates to the +x direction. 6c) The magnetic field is in the -y direction and rotates to -x direction. 6d) The magnetic field is in the -z direction and the loop moves in the +x direction while the field stays in the same location. (Remember that the field does not exist outside the original location of the loop)

A 2-year-old female infant was transferred for admission to the Children's Hospital after being noted to be hypoxemic soon after birth.  She was a full-term infant from an uneventful pregnancy.  A transthoracic contrast echocardiogram of the pediatric heart done on admission did not reveal any major cardiac defects.  however, there was right-to-left shunting suggestive of primary pulmonary hypertension in a newborn or persistent fetal circulation.  The physicians were concerned about her episodes of significant hypoxemia.  during the morning of day 2 the infant required significantly increased inotropic medication support to maintain her hemodynamics.  Given the lability as well as the increase in inotropes, it was felt that she would benefit from ECMO support.  Neurologically, some movements had been noted earlier today, and the liver function and renal function tests were within normal range, suggesting to that there was no significant end-organ injury related to the hypoxia.  The infant was taken to the operating room and sedated with fentanyl, Versed, and vecuronium.  A transverse skin incision was made 2cm above the medial aspect of the clavicle and extended down through the subcutaneous tissues and platysma.  The internal jugular vein and the carotid artery were identified.   Two Ethibond ties were passed proximal and distal around each of the vessels.  Intravenous heparin of 50 units/kg was administered.  The distal carotid artery was ligated and the proximal carotid cannulated with a 10-French Biomedicus arterial cannula.  A longitudinal venotomy was performed, and a 12- French Biomedicus cannula was inserted into the superior vena cava while a 12-French polystan cannula was introduced cephalad, and both were secured to the vessel with a 2-0 tie.  The ECMO circuit was brought into the field and tubing divided.  The arterial cannula was connected to the arterial end of the circuit, taking care to avoid air entry, and the venous cannulae were connected to the venous end of the circuit.   ECMI flows were initiated.  The patient tolerated the procedure, and no complications were encountered.  The sternocleidomastoid was reapproximated with a 3-0 Vicryl suture and skin was closed with multiple interrupted 3-0 nylon sutures.  Dressings were applied in standard fashion.  The physicians provided a final diagnosis of persistent fetal circulation or primary pulmonary hypertension of newborn.   The continuous veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was successful in treating the patient's symptoms of hypoxemia due to the primary pulmonary hypertension of newborn.

Decide if each of the statements below is true or false. Give a brief explanation (i.e., one or two sentences) for why you chose your answer. To receive any credit at all you must provide an explanation. (h) Consider the following feature selection algorithm (called The Uninformative Feature Function, or TUFF): remove features in your data which have entropy below some suitably low threshold and keep the rest. TUFF is an effective feature selection algorithm for the task of classification because it throws away the least informative features.

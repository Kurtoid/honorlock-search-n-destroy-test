Dan is a chemist working with a nuclear power plant, and is tasked with determining the viability of a new ore for uranium extraction. He plans to do some on-site titration analysis to determine the concentration of uranium in the ore.

You set up a titration with 0.1[conc1]0 M KMnO4 as the titrant, and a 25.00 mL aliquot of a U4+ solution with unknown concentration. During the titration, the volume level in the buret starts at 6.[Vi] mL and ends at 3[Vf1].[Vf2] mL. (I've given you the balanced reaction above.) What is [U4+] in the analyte?

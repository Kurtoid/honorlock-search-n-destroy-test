A 4-year-old patient presents to the ER after a sudden onset of high fever and chills, a productive cough, and shortness of breath. The parents indicate that the child had been healthy up until that morning. An initial assessment of the child shows an elevated temperature (103oF), rapid pulse rate (140 bpm), and low oxygen saturation level (82%). Supplemental oxygen and acetaminophen are administered immediately, and specimens are obtained from the patient for microbial analysis. The specimens are Gram-stained and analyzed microscopically. The laboratory technician observes spherical purple cells arranged in short chains. Based upon this evidence, which of the following microbes is potentially the pathogen affecting the patient?

Calculating GPA Create a C function called gradeValue(). This function accepts one input argument with a single character type. The function gradeValue() should be able to determine the value of a letter grade and return a floating point number which represents the value of the input letter grade.    Letter Grade Value   A 4.00   B 3.00   C 2.00   D 1.00   F 0.00   Others -1.00    Use switch-case statement within the function gradeValue(). Assume that the user always enters a capital letter. If the value of the input argument is not one of the valid letter grades as listed above, the function gradeValue() must return -1.00 Complete the given C code below to create a C program that can display a list of 4 courses along with their corresponding credits and letter grades. Then, the program should be able to calculate Grade Point Average (GPA) of those four courses. (Hint: Call the function gradeValue() within the for loop to convert letter grade to grade value. Declare additional variables if necessary.) #include #define N 4int main(){    char name[N][30]={"Physics","Calculus","Programming","Spanish"};    int credit[N]={4,4,3,3}, i;    char letter[N]={'A','B','A','C'};        printf("%-13s %6s %6snn","Course","Credit","Grade");    for(i=0; i

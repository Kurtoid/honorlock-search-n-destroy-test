HYPOTHETICAL: Lask week, IKEA, a swedish furniture store, announced they would open a new location in Gainesville by the end of the year. The Independent Florida Alligator got the scoop and wrote a story with all of the details of the new development. Immediately, several other Florida newspapers picked up the story. In the Gainesville Sun's republication of the article, the newspaper copied 90% of the story from the Alligator word for word. The Alligator did not register the story with the U.S. Copyright Office, however, they have determined they would like to sue the Gainesville Sun for copyright infringement. Please  analyze the elements of copyright and give your opinion on the merits of the copyright infringement lawsuit. Use the facts I've included, and if more information would help your analysis, let me know what that might be.  (5 pts, 200 words)

On a seashore in California, succession starts with little brown barnacles that colonize bare rock. Eventually, larger acorn barnacles replace the little barnacles. Eventually macroalgae also becomes common. To study the mechanism of succession, researchers scrape multiple sites clear of all organisms. Each site then received one of five manipulations: (1) no subsequent removal of any organisms, (2) removal of little brown barnacles that colonized, (3) removal of acorn barnacles that colonized, (4) removal of all barnacles that colonized, or (5) attachment of empty acorn barnacle shells. The density of the macroalgae was then monitored for 2 years. The figure below shows the growth of algae on the experimental plots.    a) Which of the mechanisms of succession (facilitation, inhibition, or tolerance) likely contributed to the growth of macroalgae? Explain your reasoning. b) Choose a mechanism of succession that was not supported by the data. How would you expect the data from the experiment to have differed if this mechanism had caused the growth of macroalgae? To ensure accurate grading, label you answer to each part (a-b) and separate with a blank line.

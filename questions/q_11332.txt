Reading Selection One Long before I began Dumpster diving I was impressed with Dumpsters, enough so that I wrote the Merriam-Webster research service to discover what I could about the word Dumpster.   I learned from them that it is a proprietary word belonging to the Dempster Dumpster Company. Since then I have dutifully capitalized the word, although it was lower cased in almost all the citations Merriam-Webster photocopied for me. Dempster's word is appropriate. I have never heard these things called anything but Dumpsters. I do not know anyone who knows the generic name for these objects.  From time to time, I have heard a wino or hobo give some corrupted credit to the original and call them Dipsy Dumpsters.   I began Dumpster diving about-a year before I became homeless.                              I prefer the word scavenging and use the word scrounging when I mean to be obscure. I have heard people, evidently meaning to be polite, use the word foraging, but I prefer to reserve that word for gathering nuts, berries, and such, which I do also according to the season and the opportunity.  Dumpster diving seems to me to be a little too cute and, in my case, inaccurate because I lack the athletic ability to lower myself into the Dumpsters as the true divers do, much to their increased profit.   I like the frankness of the word scavenging, which I can hardly think of without picturing a big black snail on an aquarium wall. I live from the refuse of others. I am a scavenger. I think it is a sound and honorable niche, although if I could I would naturally prefer to live the comfortable consumer life, perhaps - and only perhaps - as a slightly less wasteful consumer, owing to what I have learned as a scavenger.   While Lizbeth and I were still living in the shack on Avenue B as my savings ran out, I put almost all my sporadic income into rent.  To get necessities of daily life I began to extract from dumpsters.  Yes, we ate from them.  Except for jeans, all my clothes came from dumpsters. Boom boxes, candles, bedding, toilet paper, a virgin male love doll, medicine,books, a typewriter, dishes, furnishings, and change, sometimes amounting to many dollars, I acquired many things from the Dumpsters.

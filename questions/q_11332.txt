Receptor tyrosine kinases, which bind to peptide/protein hormones, may exist as dimers or dimerize during binding to ligands. Ligand binding leads to activation of the kinase activity of the receptor and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in its cytosolic domain. What is the immediate result once most receptor protein-tyrosine kinases bind to their ligand?

Combustions (Canvas Q6) In Ch. 4.5, we discussed complete combustions, in which all carbon contained in a compound is converted to CO2. The complete combustion of methane (natural gas) is shown below. CH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) - CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g) However, in low-oxygen conditions (such as when a generator is run indoors for long periods of time), an incomplete combustion occurs instead, where the carbon content is converted to CO. Incomplete combustions are not ideal: carbon monoxide is highly toxic and can cause severe injury or even death (this is one reason why you should never run a generator indoors!). The incomplete combustion of methane is shown below. CH4 (g) + 3/2 O2 (g) - CO (g) + 2 H2O (g) Consider a furnace that is being used to heat a home up via the combustion of methane. From a thermochemical perspective, which combustion reaction is more efficient at heat production: the complete combustion, or the incomplete combustion? Briefly explain and justify your choice (using complete sentences) in the context of DHdegf and q. Optional: You may use the scratch space in the Handwritten Pages to draw a diagram or write some equations to supplement your answer if it makes your explanation clearer or demonstrate your argument. Make sure to say that you've included stuff in the scratch space, or else I won't know to check it! ( Scratch )

Receptor X (XR) is a transmembrane protein. This protein has been engineered as a fusion protein containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) at its C-terminus.  XR-GFP is a functional protein and can replace XR in the cells.  Cells expressing XR-GFP or artificial lipid vesicles (liposomes) containing XR-GFP are subjected to fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP).  The intensity of the fluorescence of a small spot on the surface of the cells (solid line) or on the surface of the liposomes (dashed lines) is measured prior to and following photobleaching (arrow).  Explain the different behavior of XR-GFP in lipsomes vs. in the plasma membrane of the cell.

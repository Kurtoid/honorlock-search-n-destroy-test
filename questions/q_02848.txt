Mycotoxins (Canvas Q17, Handwritten Pages Q17ab) Background: Fungi, neither animal nor plant, are abundant in our natural world: many living things we see in our everyday lives are classified as a fungus, ranging from the mushrooms we eat, to the mold found on rotting food, to the mildew commonly found in warm humid regions. Many types of fungi produce compounds known as mycotoxins as a defense mechanism. Some of these compounds are highly toxic to humans, causing severe harm or even death. Others target bacteria or viruses selectively and can be used medically as antibiotics or antivirals. Still others are promising as anti-cancer treatments, as they target rapidly-dividing cells. Mycotoxins are thus an active area of medical research in the hunt for new medications. Question: While studying a newly discovered fungus, a biochemist has managed to isolate a new mycotoxin that shows promise as an antiviral drug. To characterize this new mycotoxin, the biologist wants to determine the molecular formula of this substance. Elemental analysis indicates that this compound contains only carbon (47.1%), hydrogen (5.9%), and oxygen (47.0%). An accurate molar mass could not be measured, but the compound is estimated to have a molar mass close to 200 g/mol. What is the empirical formula of this compound? [emp] What is the molecular formula of this compound? [molec] (Enter your formula with C and H first, followed by the other elements in alphabetical order. The blanks will not allow you to enter subscripts; type them in as normal numbers. For example, water would be entered as just "H2O". You should still be using proper subscripts on your work, though!) (Additional 10 points) On your Handwritten Pages, show all of your work for finding the empirical formula ( Q17a ) and the molecular formula ( Q17b ). Box your final answers.

Today is May 15, 2017 (t=0). You observe the following term structure of interest rates (semiannually-compounded, with maturity T) today.    T-t r2(t,T)   0.5 3.67   1.0 3.91   1.5 4.17   2.0 4.49   2.5 4.62   3.0 4.81      (a) What are the prices of 1-year zero coupon bond and 2.5-year zero coupon bond? (Face value: F =  $100) 1-year zero coupon bond:        [answer1] 2.5-year zero coupon bond:    [answer2]   (b) Suppose you consider buying 2.5-year zero coupon bond today. What is the expected 1-year holding period returns (HPR, annual compounding frequency) for this bond, if you believe that the expectation hypothesis would hold? [answer3] (c) Suppose you have purchased 2.5-year zero coupon bond on May 15, 2017. One year later (on May 15, 2018), you observe that the term structure of interests actually stays exactly the same as in 2017. What is the realized one-year holding period returns (HPR) for the bond? [answer4] (d) If you are planning to hold the bond to the maturity (2.5 years),  do the changes in the term structure of interest rates matter to you? [answer5]   (e) Suppose you observe that a bank offers the following forward rate: f2(0, 1, 2.5) = 3.80%, which allows you to invest/borrow $100 million dollars at the quoted forward rate for the 1.5 years after 1 year from now (from May 15, 2018 to November 15, 2019). Is there an arbitrage opportunity? If there is, how would you take advantage of it? Describe the exact transactions that you need to make in order to obtain an arbitrage profit. First, assume that all zero-coupon bonds are traded at their fair values. Second, assume that you would like to generate positive cash-flows today and no other cash flows in the future.  (Step 1) You [answer6] $100 million dollars at the bank's quoted forward rate (3.80%) (Step 2) You [answer7] 1-million units of 1-year zero-coupon bonds.  (Step 3) You [answer8] [answer10]-million units of 2.5-year zero-coupon bonds.    (f) With increasing term structure of interest rates, do you think Yield-to-Maturity (YTM) of 5-year 4% coupon bond should be higher than that of 3-year 4% coupon bond? [answer9]

The following question will only be shown in the actual exam, so it is important to collect all the data/information before submitting/disconnecting from your exam.  NOTE: The essay question will be graded separately and it is worth 20 points. Complete your work on a blank piece of paper.  You will have 30 minutes after you finish your test to finish and submit all the answers for this question to the "Exam 2 Part 2" assignment on the "Exams" link. Submit BOTH SIDES of each paper as a single PDF file (preferred) or jpeg file.  A population of birds called the founder generation - consisting of 200 Black (AA) individuals, 200 Grey (Aa) individuals and 600 White (aa) individuals- is established on the remote island of Hope. Mating within this population occurs at random, the three genotypes are selectively neutral and mutations occur at a negligible rate. Questions:  (a) What are the frequencies of alleles A and a in the founder generation? Show your calculations. (4 points).   Frequency of allele A =__________________ Frequency of allele a = __________________ (b) Calculate p2, 2pq, q2 and the expected number of AA individuals, Aa individuals, and aa individuals in the population, assuming that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Show your calculations. Hint: use the p and q values you found above. (6 points). p2=  2pq=  q2= Expected number Black (AA) = Expected number Grey (Aa) = Expected number White (aa) = Is the founder generation at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? Find ALL the values needed to complete the table below and write them down on your sheet. Last row can be left as fractions. The X2 value was kindly provided by Dr. Holechek's Grad TA. Hint: The expected frequencies and expected values are the ones you estimated in (b). (4 points).     Use the provided kh2 table below to determine whether this population is in HWE at the A locus.   (c) What is the P value that corresponds to this Chi-square (kh2) value? (1 point). _______________ (d) Is the population in HWE? Briefly explain your answer. (2 points). ___________________________________________ (e) Mention 3 reasons why most populations are not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. (3 points). 1. 2. 3.

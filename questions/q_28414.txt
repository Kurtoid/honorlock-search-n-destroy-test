Dazzle Magazine Miranda recently switched careers. Previously, she was a college professor, but she felt she needed more real-world experience to help her business students more fully. She became a manager at Dazzle Magazine, where she was in charge of the layout. Always open to new ways of doing things, Miranda let her staff implement their ideas at times. Miranda learned firsthand the different roles she had to play as a manager. It always got stressful when the publication deadline neared. At one point, there was a major mix-up in the layouts for the front cover. Miranda was not sure of the correct layout because she had allowed one of her employees, Joseph, to modify and run with his idea on this matter. However, she could not ask for Joseph's help with the covers because he happened to be out of town at the time. Miranda quickly looked over the layouts but felt that they still needed some work. She decided to ask the design manager for her help. The design manager did not feel comfortable making a decision on the issue, so she did not give Miranda an answer. Miranda then went to an employee within her department for advice. That employee suggested some ideas, but Miranda was still not satisfied. Finally, Miranda called one of her top graduate students with whom she had kept in contact and asked her if she could offer some ideas. The graduate student quickly came to the magazine's office and helped Miranda decide on the alternative that should be implemented. Miranda greatly appreciated the assistance and the suggestion. The final cover design went to press, and that issue of the magazine was successful. This helped Miranda realize that considering the big picture was good, but equally important were the little details.Refer to Dazzle Magazine.

Use the following scenario to answer questions 1-2. (5 points total). Chagas disease is caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi. This disease is common in South American countries such as Bolivia and Paraguay.  In fact, in some communities, over 70% of the population is infected with the parasite.  In approximately 30% of the population, the parasite infection will lead to chronic cardiac symptoms.  Figure 1 below is an EKG from a patient infected with Chagas.  Each small square corresponds to a .2 sec interval.    How does a Chagas patient's EKG compare to a normal EKG? Provide at least two differences between this EKG and a normal EKG.

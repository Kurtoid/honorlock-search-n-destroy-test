As you walk into the kitchen there is a very strong smell of bleach that almost stings your eyes and you see a container of open bleach sitting on the floor next to three compartment sink. You check the temperatures for the dishwasher and notice for the past 4 days the temperatures for the wash cycle has been below the 120 F regulation. As you inspect the dishwasher room there is water all over the floor and you can see steaming water coming out of a pipe under the dishwasher. When questioning the staff why the low wash temperatures were recorded, you are told because that is what the thermometer read. You proceed further into the kitchen and notice the cook putting baked fish into a serving pan at 2:30pm. The cook tells you the fish is for dinner, covers the pan and puts the cooked fish back into the oven. As you inspect the menu for the week, you notice several items are crossed off with a substitution written in by the dietary staff. All of the staff were wearing hairnets, one of the male staff did not have a beard net on, everyone was wearing gloves as appropriate. In the walk-in refrigerator, part of the floor has come loose and sticking up as you walk in and you notice the fan cover is dirty.   61.

Show work on your paper and submit on the last problem of this test.          f(x) = 2x4 - 5x3 - 2x2 + 11x - 6 Find all zeros of the polynomial (do not use fractions - use decimals and do not round). Show work if synthetic division is needed.  List multiple zeros in order from least to greatest using commas to separate and no spaces. If a zero has a multiplicity other than one write in parentheses (mult 2, or mult 3,...)after you list the zero with no space.  i.e. -7(mult 2),-5,1(mult 3)  a) Zeros: [z]   Parts b)-e) are only on your "graph paper". No answers are entered here. b) Write each function as a product of linear factors.  c) Write the domain of f(x) using interval notation on the paper. d) Write the range of f(x) using interval notation on the paper. e) Graph the polynomial function on the graph paper you printed prior to the test. Be sure to include exact ordered pairs (dots) for zeros, intercepts, maximums or minimums.

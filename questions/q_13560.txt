The patient is a 46-year-old female, gravida 3, para 3, admitted to the hospital for a scheduled vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The patient has an extensive gynecologic history and was most recently seen for dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. She stated she was having prolonged, heavy menses with disturbing premenstrual syndrome that was lasting three to four days before the onset of the menses. Six months ago, an outpatient laparoscopy was performed and extensive endometriosis of the uterus ovaries, tubes, and pelvic peritoneum was found. Lysis of adhesion and ablation of the endometriosis was attempted, but due to the extensive nature of the disease, it was known the procedure would not be entirely successful. In addition, the patient has been diagnosed and treated for cervical dysplasia described as mild to moderate that was investigated with 11 different biopsies. All subsequent pap smears have been normal. Despite continued treatment, the patient still suffers from chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia. After discussing her treatment options, the patient consented to a vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy to treat the extensive endometriosis of the various sites previously described. The surgery was accomplished without difficulty, and the patient was able to go home on day three. An additional diagnosis was added to the record when the pathology report was reviewed by the surgeon. The pathologist'. report confirmed the endometriosis as well as a small lesion of the cervix that was found to be carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

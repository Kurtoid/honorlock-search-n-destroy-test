If needed, the special case formulas for electric field due to charge distributions are provided if you click the Show Instructions button on the top of this quiz. In the figure a small, nonconducting ball of mass m = [m] kg and charge q = [q] x 10-12 C (distributed uniformly through its volume) hangs from an insulating thread that makes an angle th with a vertical, uniformly charged nonconducting sheet (shown in cross section). The surface charge density of the sheet is s=[sigma] C/m2. Considering the gravitational force on the ball and assuming the sheet extends far vertically and into and out of the page, find the angle theta, in degrees, where the ball hangs at equilibrium. Take the gravitational acceleration on Earth to be g = 10 m/s2.

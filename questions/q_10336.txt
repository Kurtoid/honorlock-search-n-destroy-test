Solve the following problem on paper and scan and upload your solution as a pdf. Solutions must be clearly readable for full credit. Show your work. Show units in your answers. Show any formulas used. Report final answers with accuracy of two decimal places, unless answer is an exact whole number. Round up or down as appropriate for whole machines or workers. (5 pt.) A flexible manufacturing system consists of a load/unload station and two machining workstations. Station 1 is the load/unload station and uses one server (material handling worker).  Station 2 performs drilling operations and consists of three servers (three identical CNC drilling machines). Station 3 has two servers that performs thread tapping (two identical CNC drill presses). The stations are connected by a part handling system that has two work carriers. The mean transport time is 2.2 minutes. The FMS produces two parts, A and B. The part mix fractions and process routings for the two parts are in the table.  Operation frequency fijk = 1.0 for all operations. Determine (a) (2pt) workload (in minutes) for each station (including the material handling), (b) (2pt) WLi/si ratio for each station (including material handling), and (c) (1pt) identify the bottleneck station.

Problem 3.2 A simple model of the horizontal vibration of a four-story building has each floor modeled as a lumped mass and the walls are modeled as providing horizonal stiffness. As shown, this model is illustrated by 4 lumped masses in series with 4 springs.  Ground (base) motion is  .  First floor motion represented by coordinate , second floor motion represented by coordinate , etc. This 4-DOF system has natural frequencies and mode shapes as follows where first term in modal vector is for floor 1.  I.e., modal vector  is   where   is 1st floor displacement amplitude for mode  , etc.        Questions: 3.2 a) Describe the motion of the fourth mode, identifying locations of zero motion.

A group of students has been trained to increase their score on the math segment of the S.A.T.  For the general population, S.A.T.-Math scores are distributed N (495,105). It is reasonable to assume that the shape of the distribution is unchanged by training effects, but is shifted, hopefully to the right. It follows that we assume that s=105.

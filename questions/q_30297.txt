Ben is an 8 year old boy with autism. His supervisor had his team of therapists teach him to say, "hello, how are you?" as a greeting. Every time Ben now meets anyone, he responds with, "Hello, how are you?" Ben's parents are concerned that their son's language seems stilted and parrot-like. Although Ben was using his new greeting skill appropriately, its restricted form was not serving him well in the realworld. The supervisor failed to program for:

Read the following passage from "A New Home for NASA's Biological and Physical Sciences Research."  Then, based on your reading of the passage, choose the most appropriate answer to the question that follows the passage. You may be asked other questions about the same passage. BPS RESEARCH IN ACTION: A SAMPLING OF CURRENT STUDIES Whether you know it or not, quantum science touches our lives each day. Quantum mechanics refers to the branch of physics that focuses on the behaviors of atoms and subatomic particles, and it is a foundational part of many components in many modern technologies, including cell phones and computers, that employ the wave nature of electrons in silicon. One example of quantum research supported by BPS is the Cold Atom Lab (CAL), the world's first multi-user facility for the study of ultra-cold atoms in space. A "mini-lab" in space, CAL gives researchers a suite of tools to cool, tune and probe ultra-cold atoms. In low gravity, cold atom clouds essentially "free float" inside a high vacuum chamber. Under these conditions it is possible to reach lower temperatures and to create experiments not possible on Earth. As atoms get colder, they move more slowly and become effectively larger. Ultracold atom facilities like CAL cool atoms down below a billionth of a degree above absolute zero, the temperature at which they would theoretically almost stop moving entirely. At these low temperatures, the atoms can form unique quantum states of matter. Development of quantum science and technology is still at the discovery stage. Physicists are just beginning to build practical quantum computers, and experiments with the quantum properties of matter have only been possible at all because of research technologies developed in the last 20 years. NASA is currently partnering with outstanding physicists from around the world to advance quantum science through space-based research. This research could enable new opportunities on a ten-year horizon, possibly including: the development of quantum processors which may enable limited computing applications; new sensors for biotechnology and defense; next-generation positioning, navigation, and timing systems for military and commercial applications; new approaches to understanding materials, chemistry, and even gravity through quantum information theory; novel algorithms for machine learning and optimization; and transformative cyber security systems including quantum-resistant cryptography in response to developments in quantum information science.

Branding efforts rely on simple images, icons, logos, words, and brief taglines to communicate enormous amounts of meaning about the organization or its products and services. The meaning depends on context. Branding magic happens when communication strategists successfully align an organization's actions, communication, and culture with the cultural contexts of key publics. This type of branding context is the application of ___________.

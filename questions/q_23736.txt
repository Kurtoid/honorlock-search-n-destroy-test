Figure 1 shows three different loops in the program and how they progress over time in the frequency domain.      Frequency of the first loop is f1=150 MHz, frequency of the second loop is f2=200 MHz, and frequency of the third loop is f3=100 MHz.  Calculate how much time it takes to complete one iteration of each of three loops.

After the mother's death and with the daughter's permission, the son took sole possession of the farm and agreed to pay the daughter a stipulated monthly rent. Several years later, the son defaulted on a personal loan, and his creditor obtained a judgment against him for $30,000. The creditor promptly and properly filed the judgment.

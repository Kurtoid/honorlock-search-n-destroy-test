False Claims of Performance: False claims for work that has been submitted by a Student. Grade Alteration: Alteration of any academic grade or rating so as to obtain unearned academic credit. Deliberate Falsification: Deliberate falsification of a written or verbal statement of fact to a Faculty member and/or Institute Official, so as to obtain unearned academic credit. Forgery: Forgery, alteration, or misuse of any Institute document relating to the academic status of the Student. Distortion: Any act that distorts or could distort grades or other academic records.  While these acts constitute assured instances of academic misconduct, other acts of academic misconduct may be defined by the professor.

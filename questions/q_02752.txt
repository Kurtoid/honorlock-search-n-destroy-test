Woods: Women's Health A 38-year-old female presents to the pharmacy requesting a medication for a "yeast infection".  She reports that she has had yeast infections in the past and she is pretty sure this one is the same thing.  Upon questioning her about her symptoms, she states that she has vaginal discharge and itching, however, now upon thinking about it, the discharge is "green and like a foam or something".  What do you recommend for MH?

Question 2 (20 marks) Using the knowledge of fracture mechanics, answer the following questions:  Explain the difference between stress intensity factor K and fracture toughness KC. What we can predict based on Fail-Safe Design criterion?        (12 marks) The stress intensity factor for a partial-through thickness flaw is given by K=Yspa{"version":"1.1","math":"K=Yspa"}, where a is the depth of penetration of the flaw through wall thickness t. The shape factor can be calculated with equation (Y=1cos(pa/2t){"version":"1.1","math":"Y=1cos(pa/2t)"}). The flaw is 5 mm deep in a 12 mm thick plate. Under an applied stress of 172 MPa, determine if the plate will fail by fracture if it is made from 7075-T6 aluminium alloy. The plane strain fracture toughness KIC of 7075-T6 aluminium alloy is 24 MPa m1/2, the yield stress sy of 7075-T6 aluminium alloy is 500 MPa. (8 marks)

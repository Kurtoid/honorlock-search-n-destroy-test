For Questions 17-20, consider the following situation: Alcohol abuse researchers wanted to determine if the number of alcoholic drinks per week drunk by a successful college student had any impact on his/her studies (and in particular, on his/her GPA).  Sixty graduating seniors were selected at random and asked what their GPA was and how many drinks they had, per week, throughout their college career.  Here are the results of the analysis of the least squares regression line for this data:      The regression equation is:                                           GPA = 3.45140 - 0.0592606 DRINKS                                                                                S = 0.386810      R2 = 31.8 %      R2 (adj) = 30.6 %    How would we interpret the slope of this equation?     For each one additional drink per week, the student's GPA should increase by .059     points, on average. For each one additional drink per week, the student's GPA should decrease by .059 points, on average. For each 3.45 additional drinks per week, the student's GPA should decrease by .059 points, on average It is inappropriate to interpret the slope for this equation, since R2 is so small.

I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man's life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener's countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: "Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!" Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.      Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing. "I agree with you," replied the stranger; "we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves--such a friend ought to be--do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I--I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew."

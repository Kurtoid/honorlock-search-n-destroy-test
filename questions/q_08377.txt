A study on the effects of osteoarthritis on the weight-bearing capacity of knee joints was conducted. The following summary data shows the stance duration (ms) for samples of both older and younger adults. Assume that both stance duration distributions are normal. Age                       n            Sample mean         s Older                  22               777                   97 Younger              18               805                  120   a. Calculate a 99% confidence lower bound for the true stance duration of Older adults. Lower bound = [LB1] b. Calculate a two-sided 90% confidence interval for the difference between true average stance duration for the older and younger adults. (Use df = 30) Lower bound = [LB] Upper bound= [UB]  c. True or False. It is plausible that there is no difference in the true average stance duration among older individuals and younger individuals. This is [plausible]

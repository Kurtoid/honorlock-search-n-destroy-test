A study looked at the number of people who chose to obtain the flu vaccine. Of the 1,000 who chose to receive the flu vaccine, 149 still developed flu-like symptoms. Of the 402 people who did not get the vaccine, 68 people developed flu-like symptoms.    Here is a partially filled-in two-way table of the given information. You will have an opportunity at the end of the exam to upload an image of your work.  Vaccine    Received the vaccine Did not receive the vaccine Totals   Number of people who had flu-like symptoms 149 68 c = [c]   Number of people who did Not have flu-like symptoms a = [a] b = [b] d = [d]   Totals 1,000 402 e = [e]       Fill in the remaining values in the table (letters a, b, c, d, and e). Determine the proportion of all people who developed flu-like symptoms. You can enter a fraction (like 23/45) or a decimal (like 0.5111)  [p-flu] Calculate the marginal distribution for the number of people that received the vaccine. [rec] For both the people who received the vaccine and those who did not receive the vaccine, calculate the conditional proportion of people who had flu-like symptoms.  Conditional proportion for people who had flu-like symptoms and received the vaccine = [convac] Conditional proportion for people who had flu-like symptoms and did not receive the vaccine = [connovac]   Calculate the relative risk of having flu-like symptoms, comparing those who received the vaccine and those did not. relative risk = [risk]

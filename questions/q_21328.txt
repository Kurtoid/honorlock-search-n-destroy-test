While skateboarding, Billy swerved to miss a pot hole and ran into the rear of parked car. It turns out, the car was in neutral and at the top of a hill with two college students talking inside. Billy is somewhat large, tipping the scales at 450lbs (its a big skateboard). The impact gives the college students whiplash. The car starts rolling and runs into a semi-truck hauling gasoline at the bottom of the hill, stalled in the intersection. The resulting explosion sends shards of metal into a house next to the intersection where a terrorist cell was just putting the finishing touches on a dirty bomb (nuclear infused bomb). The metal shards start the reaction for the bomb to go off and the town of Laramie is eliminated off the map. The wonderful Wyoming wind carries nuclear fallout to Cheyenne and 500 people develop cancer as a result. Billy took cover in the pothole and somehow survived the blast with minor abrasions. For what will Billy (or his parents) likely be held liable?

Here we go! Consider the online streaming service Disney+. They've got a large catalog of shows and movies. Some of the shows are ones that they've produced years ago. Some shows are ones that they've acquired the ownership, but didn't produce originally. And there are some shows for which they are actively producing just for Disney+. Now consider our four categories of the BCG Matrix: Stars, Cash Cows, Question Marks, and Dogs. Pick two shows or movies that you consider be in each category (so, eight shows/movies total) and defend why you think that show/movie should be in that category. If you don't subscribe to Disney+, that's okay. Check out the catalog. Read some descriptions. Here's every show on Disney Plus as of the date of writing this exam. https://www.androidauthority.com/disney-plus-movies-tv-shows-1040529/ (If you would like to consider something different than Disney+ because you aren't familiar with the service, email me and we'll discuss a new company.)

Choose one correct answer for each of the following four questions: Q4.1 (2.5 points): APC/C-CDH1______.  is a protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates CDK1 in complex with cyclin B is a protein kinase complex that phosphorylates and activates CDK4/6 is a monomeric protein that functions to activate the spindle assembly checkpoint is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates PLK1 in mitosis inhibits G1/S transition by degrading Cyclin D1, Cyclin D2 and Cyclin D3    Q4.2 (2.5 points): p27Kip1 (encoded by CDKN1B) ______.  requires hyper-phosphorylation in order to form a complex with E2F transcription factors is a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor that inhibits cell cycle progression inhibits cyclin A/CDK2 kinase activity by forming a complex with both cyclin A and CDK2 is not a regulator of the cell cycle is inhibited by p18-INK4C, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI)    Q4.3 (2.5 points): The Cyclin D1/CDK4 kinase complex ______.  is among the kinases that generally do not play a role in cell cycle regulation is activated by the CDKI p16-INK4A because they form a stable complex is active in G1 phase to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein pRb, promoting entry into the cell cycle Is most active in anaphase during mitosis blocks entry into the S phase of the cell cycle    Q4.4 (2.5 points): The spindle assembly checkpoint ______.  activates p53, which promotes p21CIP expression to induce cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase is activated when chromosome kinetochores are not properly attached to spindle microtubules before anaphase through the sequestration of Cdc20 by Mad2 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of securin and separase activates APC/C-CDC20 complex to promote mitotic progression activates the CDC25C phosphatase to activate mitotic kinases

Exam Integrity Agreement   By signing this agreement, I am acknowledging my personal responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the examination process.      I will keep all personal items, such as cell phones, iWatch or other devices securely stored during all testing procedures.

I will not attempt to access the internet, use a phone or otherwise communicate with outside resources during the exam. I will maintain the integrity of the exam process by refraining from discussing exam items with anyone other than my professor until exam grades are posted. I will follow-up with my professor(s) after the exam, if I have questions or concerns about my exam performance.  I understand that cheating is a violation of the university's code of conduct. I also understand that my exam will not be graded until I sign this agreement. By signing this agreement, I agree to these statements.

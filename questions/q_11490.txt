Sodium metal reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide according to the chemical equation shown below. When 0.0500 mol of Na is added to 100.00 g of water, the temperature of the resulting solution rises from 25.00degC to 46.23degC. If the specific heat of the solution is 4.18 J/(g [?] degC)., calculate DH for the reaction, as written.                   2 Na(s) + 2 H2O(l) - 2 NaOH(aq) + H2(g)    DH = ?

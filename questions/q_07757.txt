Several car dealers in State were accused of overcharging customers on registration fees by adding an illegal convenience fee.  Three dealers hired one lawyer to represent them in negotiating a settlement of the state investigation.  The dealers met with the lawyer and were informed about the potential conflict of interest and consented to the conflict.  The lawyer made a determination that he could offer competent and diligent representation to each of the clients and confirmed the consent to each client in writing.  One dealer maintained this practice for 3 years, another for 1 year, and the third for six months. The state made an offer to settle the cases of all 3 dealers.  Although the settlement terms for each dealer were slightly different, they were so favorable that the lawyer recommended that the clients accept the settlement.  The lawyer believes that there was a unique window to settle this case before the matter became public and that any delay in accepting the settlement jeopardized it.  None of the clients knew the terms offered to the other clients in the aggregate settlement, but they expressly waived the right to see such information in signing the settlement.  The lawyer informed the clients that they were entitled to seek independent counsel in whether to sign the waiver and the settlement.

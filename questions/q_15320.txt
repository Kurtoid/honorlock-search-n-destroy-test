Academic Honor Code Please read the following document carefully, and select the option at the end of the document.      The Chipola College Honor Code is based on the premise that each student has the responsibility to (1) uphold the highest standards of academic honesty in his/her own work; (2) refuse to tolerate academic dishonesty in the college community; and (3) foster a high sense of honor and social responsibility on the part of students.   Violations      Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to having or providing unauthorized outside help.  Any student who observes or learns of another student's academic dishonesty should report this violation to the instructor in whose class it has taken place.  A student who shall have assisted in the dishonesty mentioned above shall be considered equally guilty as the student who accepts such assistance. Consequences      Chipola College expects students to be honest in all of their academic work.  By enrolling at the College, students agree to adhere to the Academic Honor Code and understand that failure to comply with this code may result in academic and disciplinary action.

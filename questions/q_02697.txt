(Q001) Immigration has long been an important part of Texas culture. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S.-Mexico border tightened considerably. Traditionally, residents of areas near the border could cross it easily, but with increasing security concerns, crossings have become more difficult. The Paso del Norte bridge between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, the busiest cross-border footpath between the United States and Mexico, is one of several official international bridges in the state." One of Texas's ongoing debates is over the most effective ways to ensure border security while respecting the cultural diversity of the state.In the 2014 campaign for lieutenant governor, Houston state senator Dan Patrick campaigned on a platform of stopping the "illegal invasion" of immigrants into Texas by spending more state money on border security. Patrick claimed that the federal government was not enforcing border security adequately and that illegal immigration had brought third-world diseases into the state.In a debate between Patrick and then-San Antonio mayor Julian Castro about immigration reform, Castro accused Patrick of dog whistle politics, that is, using language that appealed indirectly to racism. Castro argued that there is no "invasion" of immigrants, that illegal immigration has dropped from its peak levels, and that undocumented immigrants are essential to the state's economy and should be allowed a path to citizenship, especially those in college or the military.Patrick disagreed, arguing that those in the country illegally should go to the "back of the line" for legal immigration and wait their turns. He also suggested that granting "amnesty"--the opportunity to eventually become U.S. citizens--to illegal immigrants would only encourage more illegal immigration, which would strain the state budget on education and health care. In addition, Patrick opposed letting undocumented immigrants pay in-state tuition at state colleges, arguing that citizens should be given the priority.The debate in Texas mirrors the national debate regarding how best to deal with immigration. There are approximately 11 million undocumented or "illegal" immigrants in the United States, and about 2 million of those immigrants are in Texas, mostly of Latino descent and mostly from Mexico.The policies of the Trump administration have only intensified the issues raised in the debate between Patrick and Castro. Some claim Patrick's views will drive the growing Latino population away from the Republican Party because the harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric is perceived as anti-Latino. Patrick maintained that he supports legal immigration and just wants to stop illegal immigration. Castro and others have argued that the United States is a nation of immigrants and that there must be a comprehensive way to reform the immigration system. They say that businesses in Texas greatly benefit from the hard work of undocumented immigrants and that as long as jobs are available, immigrants will find a way to make it to the United States despite expensive border security efforts.Do you agree with Dan Patrick or Julian Castro? Should illegal immigrants be given a pathway to citizenship or be sent back to their country of origin?

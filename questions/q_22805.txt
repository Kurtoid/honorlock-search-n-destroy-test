Are customers more loyal in the East or in the West? The following table is based on information from Trends in the United Sates, published by the food marketing Institute, Washington, D.C. The columns represent loyalty (in years) at a primary supermarket. The rows represent regions of the United States.      Less Than 1 Year   1 - 2 Years   3 - 4 Years  5 - 9 Years 10 - 14 Years 15 or More Years Row Total   East 32 54 59 112 77 118 452   Midwest 31 68 68 120 63 173 523   South 53 92 93 158 106 158 660   West 41 56 67 78 45 86 373   Column Total 157 270 287 468 291 535 2008   What is the probability that a customer chosen at random has been loyal from 1 to 2 years? Round your answer to the nearest thousandth.

Solve the problem. (Show all work.)Syed, who is 1.64 m tall, wishes to find the height of a tree. He walks 19.91 m from the base of the tree along the shadow of the tree until his head is in a position where the tip of his shadow exactly overlaps the end of the tree top's shadow. He is now 9.40 m from the end of the shadows. How tall is the tree? Round to the nearest hundredth.
Let A={n[?]Z | n =3r for some integer r} and B={m[?]Z | m=15s for some integer s}. 1. Prove or disprove the following: A[?]B 2. Prove or disprove the following: B[?]A

A recent randomized controlled trial in California provided support that BMI report cards are not effective in producing weight loss
The production of smart speakers uses two inputs: labor (L) and capital (K). The following production function describes how these inputs are combined to produce smart speakers.   Labor (L) is placed in the horizontal axis. The exponents for L is 1/3 and K is 2/3. (a) What is the technical rate of substitution for this production function? (b) Determine what kind of returns to scale this production function exhibits. What is the formula for that kind of returns to scale? (HINT: use f(L,K)) (c) Suppose the price of smart speakers is $60, the wage is $8, and the rental rate is $10. In the short-run, capital is fixed at 125 units. Find the short-run profit-maximizing input, output, and the associated profit.  (d) In the long-run, price, wage, and rental rate are the same as in the short-run. Find the long-run profit-maximizing inputs, output, and the associated profit.

14. A 3.00 kg block slides down a curved ramp as shown below. The work done by friction as the block slides from point A to B is 25 J. If the block starts from rest at point A what is the speed of the block when it reaches point B. The height of the curved ramp is 2.00 m.
A blood gas sample was sent to the lab on ice, and a bubble was present in the syringe.  The blood had been exposed to room air for at least 30 mins.  The following change in the blood gases will occur
In an action potential, after depolarization occurs, which cellular channels open?

Washington Irving - "Rip Van Winkle" When Rip returns from the forest, no one seems to recognize him. When he describes himself as "a loyal subject of the King, God bless him!" he sends the town into an uproar. Why is his self-proclaimed loyalty a problem?
Use the equations below to calculate the concentration of the ion and the pH of the solution. Record both answers to the tenths.  Determine if the solution is acidic, basic or neutral.  (H3O+) x  (OH-) = 1.00 x 10-14 M2                 pH  = -log(H3O+) Given:  (H3O+) = 2.7 x 10-4 M             (OH-) = [OH]              pH  =  [ph]     acidic, basic, or neutral? = [acid]

A disk has mass m = 5 kg, outer radius Ro = 3.5 m, Ri = 2m, and mass moment of inertia .  The disk rolls without slipping on its inner radius at point B.  A cord is wrapped around the inner radius and passes over a massless pulley of radius rP = 0.2 m and is connected to a hanging mass mF = 2 kg. In addition to the cord, there is a force P = 50 N acting tangentially and horizontally to the outer radius of the disk.  Give the equations that must be solved in order to determine the initial acceleration of the disk, aC, when released from rest. You need not solve the equations, but give all force and moment balance relations and all kinematic equations necessary to describe the system.  Clearly indicate the unknowns in your equations.

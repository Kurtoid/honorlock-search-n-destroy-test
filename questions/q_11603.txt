6. Methodology (12 points) Several algorithms that we've studied are binary classifiers; that is, they tell you whether an instance belongs to a specific class or not. This is in contrast to a multi-way classifier that can tell you which of many classes an instance is in. (a) How might you use one of these binary classifiers to distinguish multiple classes? Note: you should not modify the algorithm itself. Instead, consider how you might use it as a component inside a larger algo- rithm. Do you think your approach would work well? (b) Suppose you wanted to test the performance of one of these classifiers. You write some code and calculate its predictive accuracy (in whatever way you'd like). You get a very high accuracy, but Chipmunk (that's the name of a perky underclassman who works for you) points out that your results may not actually be that impressive (the student becomes the teacher!). What are some useful baseline algorithms to compare the algorithm's performance against and convince Chipmunk? Describe two such baselines and justify their inclusion in your evaluation. Clearly mark your answers with (a) and (b).

In this question, we are going to use a naive model to create the cross-validation process. A naive moving averaging filter forecasting can be done using the average of the m observations before time t to estimate the out-of-sample Xt:      Given the historic data below:    2020_01_20 2020_01_21 2020_01_22 2020_01_23 2020_01_24 2020_01_25 2020_01_26 2020_01_27 2020_01_28 2020_01_29   10 11 12 13 14 13 12 11 10 9      Apply one-step forward rolling cross-validation for the historic data to calculate MAE for a naive MA filter model with m=3, use the initial split size =8 (train size starts with 8).  A. For each step of the cross-validation, write down    The train set of the current step  The forecast value using MA filter m=3  B. Calculate the MAE_validation using the forecast values and actual values.

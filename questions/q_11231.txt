Choose 3 of the 5 following questions to answer and please answer extensively. You should use the entire exam time period to write as much as possible.  If you finish early, then you have not really answered the questions completely.   Many important clarinet pieces have been inspired by relationships between composer and performer, for example Mozart and Stadler or commissions by 20th century performers (ex. Benny Goodman or Richard Stolzman). Identify and discuss several of these pieces, placing them in the composer's output and also in the time and place of their composition.     Each student is different. Having said that, there are a number of things an undergraduate needs to learn in 4 years. Describe a typical undergraduate program, identifying important skills and repertoire for each year, differentiating if you wish between Mus. Ed and Performance. Specific books/pieces are good, but the focus should be on building technical and musical skills.     Orchestral excerpts are a part of every clarinetists training. Provide a list of standard excerpts and discuss them with an emphasis on skills needed to perform them and ways to help a student learn those skills.     Discuss, with appropriate examples of literature, the development of the clarinet from 1700 to about 1850. How did additional keywork allow composers and performers to play more complicated and chromatic works? How should this influence performances on modern instruments?    -OR-   Discuss the major differences in fingering systems since 1850. Compare advantages and drawbacks of the 2 major fingering systems with appropriate examples.    Take a modern concerto or important chamber work (ex. Adams' Gnarly Buttons or Golijov's Dreams and Prayers of Issac the Blind). Include a discussion of how it is representative of the composer's output. Also, discuss how it might affect future writing and development of repertoire for the clarinet. Who premiered the work and how was it received? How do the style and  the writing for clarinet differ from other works written in the same decade? How would you go about teaching the work to a Master of Music clarinet student at CCM?

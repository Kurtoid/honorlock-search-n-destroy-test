Ligands interact with proteins in target cells, which are cells that are affected by chemical signals; these proteins are also called receptors. Ligands and receptors exist in several varieties; however, a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds only that ligand. Base your answers to the questions below on the following information: You have isolated a factor from the blood of a space alien and named it ACF (for A-Cell Factor). Based on preliminary data, you think that ACF could be one of three compounds normally found in human blood:  epidermal growth factor (EGF), epinephrine, or estrogen. You obtain two different preparations of ACF, one of which contains the receptors for ACF. You perform a binding assay and obtain a standard curve. Based upon this data, what value would reflect the affinity of the receptor for the ligand? (Assume a one ACF-to-one receptor interaction.)

1. Sketch how light propagates in an optical fiber. The core and cladding of an optical fiber have refractive indices of 1.55 and 1.43 respectively. Determine the maximum acceptance angle for propagation of light in the fiber. Why are wavelengths 1.55 um and 1.3 mm used in long-distance telecommunication? An optical fiber has a 30% loss for propagation of light through a 5 km distance. Determine adB. Briefly discuss how optical fiber is produced (use a diagram).

Please write a policy on one of the following case studies: Case Study  "It just can't be done; it will never work. What does Susan think she is doing?" said Sam, the head cook at the Grayville Widget Company, an account managed by the Good Times Food Service Management Company. He was talking to Abhijit, the assistant cook. Good Times had won the food service management account for the Grayville Company about two years ago. It had successfully negotiated the contract emphasizing high-quality food at reasonable prices for the employees with no required company subsidy. In fact, many of the menu items were high quality, but they were also convenience foods, and that was alleged to be the reason for a slow but steady decline in the employee participation rate. Susan, the unit manager, analyzed responses from numerous surveys, focus groups, and suggestion box memos, and also conducted many face-to-face conversations with the employees. The conclusion was almost unanimous: the employees wanted freshly prepared foods or, at least, a lot more of them than were now available. The head cook was responding to Susan's announcement about fresh food preparation at the meeting earlier in the day: "We don't have the staff, we don't have the time, we don't have the necessary storing and preparing equipment, we don't have the recipes, and many of our staff members don't have the skill. We just can't do it!" "If I was neutral about this," said Abhijit, "I would say that I could see both sides of the situation. The employees want what they want, and we want what we think we can do. I'm glad I'm not Susan as she figures this out." -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Case Study  "Look, " said Adrian, " I really like it here. It's great. But the Downtown Inn is paying three dollars more per hour. I have a family. I have to take it for them."  "It" was a banquet manager's job that had been offered to Adrian, a young and talented banquet manager at the Uptown Inn. Adrian was meeting with LeeAnn Krenshaw, his boss and the director of banquet services at the hotel where he had worked for two years.  "Are you sure the tips will be the same?" asked LeeAnn. "They said their service charge was 20 percent, same as ours," replied Adrian.  LeeAnn thought about the situation before she approached Tim Thatcher, the hotel ' s HR director. She told Tim about Adrian ' s pending resignation.  " That ' s really unfortunate, " replied Tim. " Adrian is a great worker, and we really don ' t have anyone on staff ready to move up to his position. Do you have any active applicants for the job? "  " No, but I do know the banquet supervisor at another local property, " replied LeeAnn. " She 's good, and makes about the same money there as Adrian does here. " " Do you think she would want to work here? " asked Tim. " If the money was right, I think she would, " replied LeeAnn.  " How much do you think it would take to make her consider the move? " asked Tim.  " Well, she wouldn ' t likely move for the exact same pay, " replied LeeAnn. " She ' ll want a raise to move. I think it would need to be in the three - dollar range or so per hour to make it worthwhile for her. "

Please complete the following explanation of greenhouse effect by selecting the best response from the drop-down options. Some of the electromagnetic energy from the sun passes through the Earth's atmosphere as [ultraviolet] radiation, which has a(n) [short] wavelength and high energy. The Earth absorbs some of this energy, while a portion of the energy is reflected back up towards space as [infared] radiation, which has a(n) [longer] wavelength and lower energy than the incoming radiation. This reflected radiation is then trapped, unable to penetrate an atmosphere with greenhouse gases, consequently [warming] the troposphere.

It has been stated during the course of the semester that literature doesn't necessarily present a "moral to the story" or even answers to questions that arise, but is very good at asking those questions that should be considered.  What is at least one piece of literature that posed a question that prompted you to think further about the ideas that it posed or that presented ideas (aka questions) that you had not considered before?  (Rewording the question:  What story or poem made you think or reflect more?  And what was the question it asked that made you think?)  You may use any literature we have studied over the course of the semester to answer this question, not just what we've studied since the last exam.   [Answers for this question will largely be graded on evidence of thought and quality of explanation, not on the literature selected.  Answers along the lines of "Didn't learn anything" or "None of it" will not be credited.]

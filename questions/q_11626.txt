You are the CEO of PepsiCo. You are trying to decide upon a pricing strategy for your soft drinks for the summer. You can set a high price, a medium price, or an aggressively low price. Your one competitor is Coke Cola. Coke has the same three pricing options. Both you and Coke will make your pricing decisions simultaneously. You and your team have made the following estimates of your profits and Coke's profits (the profits are in millions of dollars) and have placed them in the following payoff matrix:           Pepsi             High price   Medium price   Low price     Coke      High   price   P:  $400C:  $500   P:  $500C:  $400   P:  $200C:  $200        Medium   price   P:  $200C:  $700   P:  $300C:  $500   P:  $100 C:  $100        Low   price   P:  $0C:  $900   P:  $100C:  $400   P:  $0 C:  $100       Presuming that your estimates for Pepsi's and Coke's profits are correct, if Pepsi has an optimal choice, what is it? (If the optimal choice is a mixed strategy, tell what prices--high, medium, low--are in the mix. Do NOT work out the probabilities with which Pepsi would play the different prices.) Presuming that your estimates for Pepsi's and Coke's profits are correct, if Coke has an optimal choice, what is it? (If the optimal choice is a mixed strategy, tell what prices--high, medium, low--are in the mix. Once again, do NOT work out the probabilities with which Coke would play the different prices.) Briefly explain how you arrived at your answers.

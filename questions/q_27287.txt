Part II: Case Study Questions (30%) Campaign: Heineken Connects (Ireland) The Challenge:To eliminate the gap between the management team and the rest of the organization in knowing, understanding and living the Heineken vision, Heineken needed a strategy, framework and channels to deliver the company objective and live up to the managing director's view that internal communications is the key enabler in moving the company forward. The Approach:First, a clear objective was established to inform, engage and inspire its employees to play an active role in its vision journey. Next, they set measurable KPIs to ensure the objective was achieved and to be able to report back to business. Then they employed a four-step process -review, strategy, plan, measure and evaluate. They conducted desk research, which included a climate survey, organizational overview, reputation survey, communications survey, company vision review, and review of its current communications structure. They conducted management interviews, employee cross functional/cross level interviews, and obtained roadshow feedback. External benchmarking included interviews with five other Heineken operating companies and four external companies -Intel, IDL, Google, Pepsi, Twitter, and Glaxo SmithKline. They also reviewed the communications framework. The key communication streams were identified as follows: Brand; functional, corporate; external; and social. These were all managed by Corporate Affairs. Additionally, they had a communications Champions Team - a cross functional group with a representative from each function to lead communications within that function. It too, was led by Corporate Affairs. The Champions role was created to tell their functional stories, and to enhance feedback on ideas and insights. An integrated calendar was established to allow a pro-active approach to internal communications scheduling resulting in consistent messaging and conflict identification. A clear process of how employees could get their stories heard across the organization was developed with clear guidelines, templates and a storytelling booklet was created. A mapping exercise was conducted of the existing channels and a number of new channels and changes to existing channels were developed in response. While the global intranet was their main communications channel for sharing company information, due to connectivity and access issues they recognized the field based employees were not engaging with it. All field based employees had mobile devices, however; so, they developed a news app called Heilights that fed all of their Heineken Ireland stories and announcements directly from Heiport onto mobile devices. They also increased the use of video for communicating functional stories and company announcements. And, they developed KENTALK - A Heineken take on TEDTALKS. They also developed a Spotlight Series to improve co-operation between departments believing a key lever to improve cooperation is to increase the understanding of other people's roles. The Spotlight Series is a virtual day in the shoes where through employee video interviews employees get a glimpse into their colleagues' lives. Results:* 90% of all mobile device users are using the Hielights app on a monthly basis.* Number of employees viewing their stories have increased by 30% since the app was introduced.* Positive qualitative feedback from regional managers that their teams are fully informed on what is happening in the business.* Achieved target of 4 Spotlight Episodes.* Spotlight episodes average +150% more views than standard Heiport stories. Please answer the following questions based on the information provided in the case summary above. Please apply the theories and principles you've learned in class in the case analysis. This section of the exam includes questions 6-9.

Explain how human development (specifically, the conversion of forested land to urban areas) can impact each major portion of the hydrologic cycle (precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and evapotranspiration).  To receive full credit, you must:  Address each of the 4 parts of the hydrologic cycle listed above Describe IN DETAIL the actions of humans that initiate these changes and HOW the natural processes governing the hydrologic cycle are altered as a result of these actions  I am looking for proof that you understand the underlying concept and processes associated with each part of the hydrologic cycle, as well as how humans impact each of these processes. The more detail you provide, the more credit I can give you for your answer.

American Passages: A History of the United States, 4th edition, (c)2009 by Ayers, Gould, Oshinsky, Solderlund   The Postwar American Family, pages 793-794   Paragraph 1                               The Postwar American Family  Beginning in 1946, the United States experienced a surge in marriage rates and birthrates, following record lows in the Depression decade. The young adults ( ages eighteen to thirty) of this era became the most " marrying" generation in American history, with 97 percent of the women and 94 percent of the men taking marriage vows. By 1950, the age of marriage for American women had dropped below twenty, another record, and the percentage of divorces, initially high among returning veterans, reached an all- time low.   Paragraph 2  The baby boom was equally dramatic. The number of children per family in the United States jumped from 2.6 in 1940 to 3.2 by decade's end. ( See Picturing the Past: A Medical Miracle.) Birthrates doubled for a third child and tripled for a fourth, as the American population grew by 20 million in the 1940s. At a time when access to birth control information was rapidly increasing, U. S. population growth rivaled not England's but rather India's.   Paragraph 3  Quite naturally, this emphasis on family life strengthened long- held prejudices against married women holding full- time jobs outside the home. As a result, the gains made in female employment during World War II largely disappeared. Returning veterans reclaimed millions of factory jobs held by women and minorities. The female labor force dropped from a wartime high of 19 million in 1945 to less than 17 million by 1947. On the Ford and General Motors assembly lines, the percentage of women plummeted from 25 to 6 percent. Although many women gladly returned to their former domestic lives, the vast majority, according to postwar surveys, hoped to keep their jobs. " I'd stay if they wanted me to," said a female aircraft worker, " but without taking a man's place from him."   Paragraph 4  The social pressures on women were enormous. A host of "experts" asserted that women belonged in the home for their own good as well as the good of society-- that women needed to be housewives and mothers in order to be fulfilled. In their 1947 best- seller, Modern Women: The Lost Sex, Marynia Farnham and Ferdinand Lundberg noted that " all mature childless women are emotionally disturbed" and that " the pursuit of a career is essentially masculine." Furthermore, these experts claimed that returning veterans needed special love and attention after so many years away from home.   Paragraph 5           The emphasis on traditional sex roles also affected female education. World War II had opened up new opportunities for women in science, engineering, and medicine. For the first time in history, women constituted a majority of the nation's college graduates. But the return of male veterans, combined with the educational benefits provided them by the GI Bill, reversed these temporary gains. At Cornell University, for example, women comprised 50 percent of the wartime classes but only 20 percent of the postwar classes. More significant, the percent-age of college women who graduated fell from 40 percent during World War II to 25 percent by 1950?    What is the topic of this selection?

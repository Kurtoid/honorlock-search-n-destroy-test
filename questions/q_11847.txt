(DCI) manufacturers a line of drones that are distributed to large retailers. The line consists of four models of drones. The following data is available regarding the models:    Model DCI Selling Priceper Unit Variable Cost per Unit Demand/Year (units)   Model D1 $700 $350 1,500   Model D2 $650 $300 1,400   Model D3 $625 $325 1,375   Model D4 $500 $300 1,250      Drone Concepts is considering the addition of a fifth model to its line of drones. This model would be sold to retailers for $750. The variable cost of this unit is $575. The demand for the new Model D5 is estimated to be 1,800 units per year. Fifty percent of these unit sales of the new model is expected to come from other models already being manufactured by Drone Concepts (20 percent from Model D1, 20 percent from Model D2, 30 percent from Model D3, and 30 percent from Model D4). Drone Concepts will NOT incur any fixed cost to add the new model to the line. Based on the preceding data, should DCI add the new Model D5 to its line of drones? Why or why not? (Remember to type all calculations CLEARLY)

The total kinetic energy of the fusion products (alpha particle and neutron) is 2.82 pJ per reaction. The mass of one deuterium atom is 2.014 amu.(a) How much mass is converted into kinetic energy in one D-T reaction event? Give your answer in amu. Show your work. (1 amu=1.66x10-27 kg)(b) In 2019, the world's total primary energy consumption was 6.1x1020 J. How many metric tonnes of deuterium are needed to produce this amount of energy by D-T nuclear fusion.

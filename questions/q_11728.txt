In this problem we are given as input a directed graph G=(V,E) and a designated vertex z*.  Each edge e has a positive length w(e).  Our goal is to design an algorithm which outputs the set of all vertices  forwhich the distance from z* to this vertex is more than twice the distance from this vertex to z*.  In other words, we want to output a list of all vertices w for which dist(z*,w) > 2dist(w,z*).Note, dist(x,y) denotes the length of the shortest path from x to y. Give the fastest (in O() notation) algorithm you can for this problem.  You need to clearly state the running time in terms of n=|V| and m=|E| of your algorithm. Give a very clear and complete description of your algorithm  in words (this is required).  You can also include pseudocode if that will help clarify your algorithm (but if you just give pseudocode without explaining in words you will lose points). Do not  modify the algorithms from class}, such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, SCC, or topologically sorting. You should use them as a black-box.  If you attempt to modify one of these algorithms you will not receive full credit, even if it is correct.
Identify the Type I error. A state university annual report showed that its retention rate was at 24% and university administrators would like to increase this rate.  After implementing several new programs during the last two years, the university reevaluated its retention rate.  Identify a Type I error in the context of this hypothesis test.

Sawyer Company self-insures its property for fire and storm damage. If the company were to obtain insurance on the property, it would cost them $2,000,000 per year. The company estimates that on average it will incur losses of $1,600,000 per year. During 2018, $700,000 worth of losses were sustained. How much total expense and/or loss should be recognized by Sawyer Company for 2018?

A researcher wishes to see whether there is a relationship between the caloric contents and the sodium contents (in milligrams) of 10 beef hot dogs.  She selects five brands of hot dogs, determined the caloric contents and the sodium contents (in milligrams) of each brand.  The data is listed in the table below.       Caloric Content, x   Sodium content (mg), y     150   420     170   470     120   350     120   360     90   270        Compute the value of the correlation coefficient (you may use your calculator).  Round the value to 4 decimal places. Test the correlation coefficient for significance. Be sure to include your null and alternative hypotheses (including symbols - use the insert equation editor to do so),   If using the t-test: your t-critical value, your calculated t-test statistic, decision rule, decision, and conclusion.  The level of significance alpha, a = 0.05. If testing using table I, the statistically significant/critical value correlation coefficient, your calculated correlation coefficient, decision rule, decision, and conclusion.  The level of significance alpha, a = 0.05.   If applicable, find & interpret the coefficient of determination, R2. If applicable, find the linear regression equation. If not applicable, explain why it is not. If applicable, find the predicted sodium content if the caloric content is 140 calories. If not applicable, explain why it is not. If applicable, find the predicted sodium content if the caloric content is 210 calories. If not applicable, explain why it is not.  You must show all work for this problem.  If using a graphing calculator all computer output and explanations are required.  Failure to show your work or to provide an appropriate explanation will result in a 0 for the question's score regardless of whether or not the answer is correct.

True/False.  Enter T or F for statement.  (Do not enter the words "true" or "false".  Just the letter T or F) [1] Propagating electromagnetic waves are governed by the fully static Maxwell's equations. [2] Transmission line effects must be considered when an electrical conductor is longer than 1 meter. [3] A transmission line helps to guide electromagnetic wave energy in a certain direction, whereas in free space, electromagnetic wave energy can be distributed in three dimensions. [5] The characteristic impedance Z0 of a transmission line is largely attributed to the resistance of the copper conductors. [7] Cellular networks use square "cells" to provide radio coverage across a region of land. [8] One advantage of a half-wave dipole antenna is that the current and voltage are constant along the length of the antenna segments. [9] The radiation pattern of an antenna quantifies the potential health effects during operation. [10] Part 15 of the FCC regulations describes how one can operate a radio transmitter (such as a WiFi router) without requiring a license from the government.

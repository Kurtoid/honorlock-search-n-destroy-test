Instructions: Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.        (1) Crime dramas are some of the most watched television shows today, and it's true that shows like the popular C.S.I. are interesting and entertaining. (2) However, C.S.I. is also producing some serious problems. (3) Some people say that C.S.I. is actually making real-life crimes harder to solve by giving criminals good tips for covering their tracks. (4) For example, crime experts have been noticing an increase in cases in which suspects have burned or bleached evidence to destroy DNA samples that can be traced back to them. (5) In other cases, criminals have planned their crimes using techniques they learned on C.S.I. for leaving no evidence behind them. (6) Another effect has been the reluctance of real-life juries to convict criminals in the absence of clear-cut evidence like the kind gathered by the fictional forensic scientists on the C.S.I. show. (7) Prosecutors say that the show distorts viewers' impressions of the speed and accuracy of crime labs, technology, and gadgets. (8) Therefore, viewers form unrealistic expectations of actual criminal courtroom trials. (9) In fact, this phenomenon has been given a name: the "C.S.I. effect."

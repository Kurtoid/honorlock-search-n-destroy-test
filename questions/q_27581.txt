You may draw a U-tube o help you answer the question that follows if you like.  The solutions in the arms of a U-tube are separated at the bottom of the tube by a selectively permeable membrane. The membrane is permeable to sodium chloride but not to glucose. Side A is filled with a solution of 0.4 M glucose and 0.5 M sodium chloride (NaCl), and side B is filled with a solution containing 0.8 M glucose and 0.4 M sodium chloride. Initially, the volume in both arms is the same.   At the beginning of the experiment,  A) side A is hypertonic to side B. B) side A is hypotonic to side B. C) side A is isotonic to side B. D) side A is hypertonic to side B with respect to glucose. E) side A is hypotonic to side B with respect to sodium chloride.

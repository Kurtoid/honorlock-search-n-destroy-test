In 2021, Lucky Inc had net credit sales of $882,000. On January 1, 2021, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts had a credit balance of $22,500. Past experience indicates that 3% of net credit sales become uncollectible annually. There were no write-offs of uncollectible accounts during 2021.  What should be the adjusted balance of Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts at December 31, 2021?

This is a multi-part free-response question. For text answers, you may type in your answer in the essay box. Or you may write down your answer (including calculations, illustrations, diagrams, etc.) on a piece of blank paper. Show your answer to your camera for a few seconds once you're done with this question, and within 10 minutes after you have completed the entire exam in Honorlock, scan all your hand-written answers and send to Dr. Xue (jxue@mse.ufl.edu).   Molecular Beam Epitaxy (17 total points) You wish to epitaxially grow an InxGa1-xP ternary alloy on a GaAs substrate that requires extremely abrupt interfaces.  The ternary alloy is lattice matched to the substrate.  You will be using MBE as the growth technique.  The Knudsen cell diameters are 1.0 cm.  All Knudsen cells are pointing directly toward the substrate with a source-substrate distance of 15 cm, and the direction from the substrate to every source cell is 10deg off the substrate normal.  In mass = 114.82 amu, Ga mass = 69.72 amu.  Refer to the vapor pressure chart of the metal sources. (a) What is the composition of the alloy? (4 points) (b) To achieve a desired epitaxial growth rate of 1 mm/hr for such ternary alloy, what temperatures should the In and Ga Knudsen cells be maintained? You may assume there is a sufficient P overpressure such that the sticking coefficient of In and Ga atoms are unity. (10 points) (c) If the composition of the ternary alloy is different from that in (a) so that the epitaxial layer and the substrate are not lattice-matched, what are the three possible growth modes for the epitaxial layer?  (Simply listing the names of the growth modes is sufficient) (3 points) The vapor pressure chart of elemental sources is attached below. The curves for In and Ga are indicated in circles. Note the two different temperature scales (horizontal axis) in K and degrees Celsius. The vapor pressure (vertical axis) is in the range from 10-7 Torr to 1 Torr.

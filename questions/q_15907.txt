Using the New Wire Information below match the correct year to the correct situation. U2's massive 360 Degrees Tour wasn't just the biggest trek this year in terms of sheer size; the band's latest jaunt supporting No Line on the Horizon has also been named the year's most successful show by concert tracker Pollstar. Their research also revealed that despite the recession, concert ticket sales for the top 50 tours were up this year across the board compared to 2008's final numbers. That's thanks largely to U2, who easily surpassed all other acts by selling 1.3 million tickets during the first leg of their 360 Degrees Tour, grossing $123 million along the way. U2 learned cheap tickets ($28.50) for their 1992 concerts not only filled up every concert venue but left thousands of fans clamoring for entry. The group began another tour in April 1997, with scheduled concerts in 80 cities over a period of 14 months. This time around, however, U2 was charging as much as $52.50 a ticket - nearly double the 1992 price. By the time they got to the second city, they were playing in stadiums with lots of empty seats. For their 2009, 360 Degrees Tour, U2 offered festival seating for only $30 and sold out every performance.  Source: Article by Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone, December 31, 2009.

A semi-tractor-trailer truck consists of a tractor unit (mtractor=8,000 kg) and two semi-trailers to carry freight (mtrailer=10,000 kg). The tractor is capable of exerting 7.00 x 105 N force on the road to accelerate the truck forward. What is the maximum amount of cargo that can be added to the truck so that the truck will be able to move up a hill with 20o of inclination? Consider that the truck is stationary. Show your complete work to obtain the result.

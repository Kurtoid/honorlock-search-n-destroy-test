Alcohol abuse researchers wanted to determine if the number of alcoholic drinks per week drunk by a successful college student had any impact on his/her studies (and in particular, on his/her GPA).  Sixty graduating seniors were selected at random and asked what their GPA was and how many drinks they had, per week, throughout their college career.  Here are the results of the analysis of the least squares regression line for this data:      The regression equation is:                                           GPA = 3.45140 - 0.0592606 DRINKS                                                                                S = 0.386810      R2 = 31.8 %      R2 (adj) = 30.6 %  How would we interpret the intercept of this equation?   If a student did not drink, we expect his/her GPA to be 3.45. If a student did not drink, we expect his/her GPA to be .059. If a student's GPA was 0.0, we expect that he/she consumed 3.45 drinks per week. It is inappropriate to interpret the intercept for this equation, since graduating seniors cannot have a GPA of 0.0.

Alpha contracted in writing to purchase 100 widgets from Beta for $1,000 each. Alpha believed Beta was having problems with its suppliers and would not be able to perform all its contract obligations (Beta sold widgets to many buyers), and Alpha wanted to be sure Beta delivered to Alpha, even if Beta ran short of widgets. Alpha therefore included a contract provision requiring Beta to pay $500,000 to Alpha if Beta failed to deliver the widgets as agreed. Widgets were generally available at market prices ranging from $1,100 to $1,200, at both the time of contracting and the time Beta was to deliver. Beta failed to deliver as agreed. Is Beta liable to Alpha for $500,000?

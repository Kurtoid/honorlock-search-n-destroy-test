There are nine restaurants in the hotel, but we didn't eat in all of them.During our trip, we went to the Burj Khalifa, one of the tallest buildings in the world. We took an elevator to the observation deck. It was a little scary to be so high up, but the view from the 124th floor was amazing! We could see the city, the desert, and the ocean!And of course, the shopping was fantastic--we bought some nice clothes.

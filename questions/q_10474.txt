Palmer has also provided you with the following information (make sure you read the dates carefully):  On June 30th, 2011 the company issued 10,000 convertible, 8% standard US bonds at par. Each bond is convertible into 40 common shares.  The entire issue was converted into common shares on January 31, 2013 when the share price of Arecibo hit $43 per share.  On January 1, 2013 the company issued 5,000 stock warrants to its executives for compensation. Each warrant is convertible into a single share of Arecibo common stock at a strike price of $40.  The warrants vest in 3 years from the date of issue and expire in 5 years.  On February 1, 2014 the company purchased 225,000 shares at a market price of $41 per share. On July 1, 2014 the company issued 7,000 convertible bonds. Each bond can convert into 20 shares of common stock.  The bonds pay interest on June 30 and December 31 at 6% and were issued at par.

(4 points) Compute diluted EPS if the convertible bond conversion ratio (the number of shares received per bond converted) is 5 shares per bond instead of 20.

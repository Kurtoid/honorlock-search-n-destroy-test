Finder Construction, Inc. entered into a contract with Star Real Estate which provided that Finder would construct an office building for Star on a vacant parcel of land owned by Star.  The office building was to be constructed immediately adjacent to buildings owned by other parties, including Wilson who owned an apartment project next to Star's vacant lot.  The contract between Star and Finder included the following provision (in addition to the standard terms and conditions of a construction contract): "Finder shall repair any damage to buildings located adjacent to the construction site and owned by other parties which damage results from the construction activities conducted by Finder."  While Finder was doing some excavating work under the Finder/Star contract, the apartment building owned by Wilson was seriously damaged.

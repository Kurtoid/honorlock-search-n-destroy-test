Based on the following scenario, match the organism to its place in the food web. You are stranded on an island and you discover the diversity of life living there. There's sea grass along the shoreline that is being eaten by snails.  The snails are eaten by large marine crabs that also come ashore and eat land snails.  The land snails are feeding on mangrove tree leaves.  There are mangrove crabs on the trees that are being eaten by the larger marine crabs as well as herons.  There are crocodiles along the shoreline that eat the heron, and many fish, large and small.  The small fish are feeding on microscopic algae.  The small fish are eaten by the larger fish.  You try to catch some of the fish to eat, but are unsuccessful.  Very hungry, you walk along shore to find a coconut tree and banana tree.  You decide to eat both.  Since you do not have fire, you decide it is best to only eat plants while on the island to avoid contracting parasites.  You also notice that there are raccoons.  You note that they eat snails, crabs, small and large fish. The raccoons also eat the bananas.  You also observe one raccoon that gets surprised and eaten by a crocodile.  At night you hear howling of coyotes. You guess that they must be eating raccoons and possibly other small mammals that you may not have observed yet.

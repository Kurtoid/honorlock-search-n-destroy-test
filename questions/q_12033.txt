Talitha has created a model with six predictors (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 , x6). She has 80 observations. She found the following ANOVA table.      DF Sum of Squares Mean Sq F p-value   x1     0.002   x2     0.003   x3     0.004   x4   401  0.65   x5   300  0.26   x6   254  0.25   Residuals  [SSEfull]       She would like to remove the last three variables (x4, x5, x6) all at one time, so she ran the model with only the first three variables  (x1, x2, x3).

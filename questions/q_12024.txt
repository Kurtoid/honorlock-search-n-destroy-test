Purification of a microbial enzyme reveals an oligomeric enzyme with three independent subunits. As a novel activity, you would like to investigate whether this enzyme is present in humans. To address this possibility, you generate anti-sera and perform a Western blot analysis. Using human liver extract and purified microbial enzyme and SDS-PAGE, you observe the following patterns:        a) Would the same banding patterns have been observed if we had run a native gel instead of a denaturing SDS PAGE?  What would it look like? Why? b) Describe what the gel would have looked like had we stained for protein using Coomassie blue instead of performing a Western blot analysis. c) You are unsure if the lower band in Lane 2 is the same protein running as a smear, or two independent proteins. How would you resolve this issue (ie. more than one experiment, detail potential and limitations of each), and if the Western blot has indeed identified a functional homologue in humans, provide at least two explanations for the observed differences reflected in the Western blot.

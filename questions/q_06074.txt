A spring is compressed 100 mm and is pushing against a 1.0 kg box.  Coefficient of static friction between the box and the surface is 0.5. What is the minimum spring constant needed to cause the box to move?  Provide your answer in N/m, but do not include units in your submittal.
A zero-coupon Treasury bond (considered risk-free) costs $776 today and will be paying a par of $1000 in 10 years. A second zero-coupon bond with the same par and maturity, issued by Firm F, is worth $614. What is the risk premium of firm F? (use a decimal number, not a percentage, i.e. 0.01 instead of 1%, do not round - let Canvas do the rounding)

Scientists measured whether individuals who had been vaccinated with anti-HPV vaccines (Gardasil and Cervarix) had detectable levels of anti-HPV antibodies in their blood many years after receiving the vaccines. The data are shown here. Based only on these data, which of the following policy recommendations would you make to the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (the agency that sets vaccination schedules) regarding anti-HPV vaccines?

A 88% confidence interval for a population mean is computed from a sample of size 100.  Another 88% confidence interval will be computed from a sample of size 25 drawn from the same population.  The interval from the sample of size 100 will be approximately --------- as the interval from the sample of size 25.

Madison Construction produces two products, steel beams and wood beams.  Management desires that its product mix of beams maximize weekly total contribution margin.  Direct labor is limited to 2,500 hours per week and machine hours are limited to 1,000 hours per week.  The maximum demand for steel beams is 95 beams per week; while the maximum demand for wood beams is 100 beams per week.  Other data for the beams appear below.   Additionally, total weekly beam production cannot exceed 175 beams due to storage constraints.     Steel Beams Wood Beams   Contribution margin per beam $220 $150   Direct labor hours per  beam 130 170   Machine hours per beam 80 120    Below is a partially completed linear program model that seeks to optimize (i.e., maximizes weekly total contribution margin) the product mix of steel and wood beams.  Fill in the blanks in the partially completed model below using variables S, W and TCM which are defined as follows as well as the data provided above.  Please note: you are not being asked to solve the model, only to fill in the blanks to properly state the model.  S = number/quantity of steel beams and  W = number/quantity of wood beams and TCM = total contribution margin  The objective function is TCM = $[variable1]S + $[variable2]W  The constraints are:  Direct labor constraint is: [variable3]S + [variable4]W

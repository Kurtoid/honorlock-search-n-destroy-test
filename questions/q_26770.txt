The Melville Company produces a single product called a Pong. Melville has the capacity to produce 60,000 Pongs each year. If Melville produces at capacity, the per unit costs to produce and sell one Pong is as follows:    Direct materials $15   Direct labor 12   Variable manufacturing overhead 8   Fixed manufacturing overhead 9   Variable selling expense 8   Fixed selling expense 3   Total $55    The regular selling price for one Pong is $80. A special order has been received by Melville from Mowen Company wanting to purchase 6,000 Pongs next year at $65 per unit. If this special order is accepted, the variable selling expense will be reduced by 75%. However, Melville will have to purchase a specialized machine to engrave the Mowen name on each Pong in the special order. This machine will cost $9,000 and it will have no use and no salvage value after the special order is filled. The total fixed manufacturing overhead and the total fixed selling expenses will be unaffected by this special order. Assume Melville anticipates selling only 50,000 units of Pong to regular customers next year. The effect of accepting the special order on Melville's operating income for next year is a:

The equilibrium constants for Ca2+ and Cl- are +134mV and -65mV, respectively.  Both ions are permeable to the membrane via leak channels.  The Ca2+ leak channels expel Ca2+ out of the cell and Cl- leak channels bring Cl- in.  In addition, there are a greater number of leak channels for Cl- to enter the cell.  How would this change the resting membrane potential?

PART II     (43 points)               Richard Rock is a geologist. During 2020 he earned a salary of $38,000. He is 48 years old and has been divorced for four years. He and his wife married the summer after they graduated from high school. They had two children before they were 23 years old. Both of those children are now in their late twenties. Richard's ex-wife entered a singing contest when the youngest child entered high school. She won at the local level and placed third at the national level. She was offered a recording contract and eventually became a successful country singer. Her travel commitments caused a great strain on the marriage and eventually she and Richard decided to divorce. The divorce was very amicable and the family regular gathers for family events and special occasions at both Richard's home and his former spouse's home.               During 2020 Richard was recognized as the outstanding geologist of Colorado. The recognition resulted in a $2,500 cash award that Richard used to pay off his car loan. During 2020 Richard also collected $12,000 from an annuity for his life that his late father gave to him three years earlier. The annuity had a tax cost of $255,200 and Richard's life expectancy was twenty-eight years when he received the first annuity payment. Richard received $50,000 as a beneficiary on his Uncle Will's life insurance policy when Will died in early 2020.               On March 1, 2020 it was discovered that the CEO of Richard's employer had embezzled a substantial sum of money. Richard lost his job when the employer had to declare bankruptcy. Richard collected $1,800 of unemployment benefits from the state and federal governments. For a number of years Richard had been considering whether to venture out on his own and operate his own business.  He had developed a lot of solid relationships with clients and he believed that many of them would follow him if he were to start his own business.  With the bankruptcy of his employer Richard decided that he would do it.  In March Richard put his business plan together and in April 2020 opened his doors for business as a LLC operating as a "disregarded entity."  As a disregarded entity all gross income and deductions flow through the entity directly to Richard's personal tax return. Richard is the sole shareholder of Geo-Jack LLC [G-J]. G-J reports on a calendar year and uses the accrual method of accounting. The following financial information is relevant for filing Richard's 2020 tax return.   In April GJ rented a small business office about 12 miles from Richard's home. GJ paid $10,000 which represented a damage deposit of $4,000 and rent for 2020 GJ earned and collected $290,000 performing geological-related services and from royalties for its specialized digging tool [see part (8) below]. GJ received $50 interest from municipal bonds and $2,100 interest from other investments. GJ purchased some new equipment in May for $42,500. It properly claimed depreciation on these assets during the year in the amount of $42,500 in accordance with IRC Section 179. In an attempt to get his name and new business recognized, GJ paid $7,000 for a one-page ad in the Geologic Survey. It also paid $15,000 in radio ads to be run through the end of December. GJ leased additional office space in a building downtown. GJ paid rent of $27,000 for the year. GJ incurred a $4,000 fine from the state government for digging in an unauthorized digging zone. In August GJ began to receive royalties on a special geological digging tool invented by Richard and licensed to a large manufacturer of geology related tools.                Richard also rents out a small apartment building that he owns.  This year Richard received $30,000 of rental payments from tenants and he incurred $19,500 of expenses associated with the rental including depreciation.   When Richard started GJ it was necessary for him to relocate to another region of Colorado. He moved during March 2018. Richard paid a moving company $2,010 to move their personal belongings. He spent a leisurely two days driving his car the 350 miles to his new home. The IRS standard mileage allowance for moving vehicles is $.23 per mile. During the trip, Richard paid $143 for lodging and $85 for meals.  Richard's mother was so excited to have her son move closer to her home that she gave Richard $3,000 to help out with the moving costs.   Richard sold a parcel of undeveloped land that he has owned for over 15 years for $475,000 and used the money to provide working capital for the new business. The adjusted basis of the land at the time of the sale was $190,000.   Richard received a $1,500 reimbursement from his insurance company in February 2020 for actual medical expenses incurred and deducted during 2019. However, a careful examination confirmed that his 2019 medical expense deduction did not reduce his 2019 federal income taxes.    Richard kept track of several expenses this year that he thought might be relevant to his 2020 tax computation. Specifically, he paid $2,600 in state income taxes, $9,400 in real property taxes, and $6,500 in charitable contributions during the year. The charitable contributions were made to a state university and a church. He also paid the following medical-related expenses:        Unreimbursed doctor fees                  $4,795 [paid after his employer provided coverage                                                                                         was cancelled]      Unreimbursed Dental bills                  $1,100      Prescription medicine                         $   550      Nonprescription medicine                   $   100               In January 2020 Richard got distracted while driving and he ran into a street sign.  The accident caused $900 in damage to the car and gave him whiplash.  Because the repairs were less than his insurance deductible, he paid the entire cost of the repairs.  Richard wasn't able to work for two weeks after the accident.  Fortunately, he received $2,000 from his disability insurance.  His employer had paid 60% of the premiums on the policy as a nontaxable fringe benefit and Richard had paid the remaining 40% portion.               A few years ago, Richard acquired several investments with his portion of the divorce settlement.  This year he reported the following income from his investments: $2,200 of interest income from corporate bonds and $1,500 interest income from the City of Denver municipal bonds.  Overall, Richard's stock portfolio appreciated by $12,000 during 2020 but he did not sell any of his stocks.               Richard had $10,000 of federal income taxes withheld by his employer. Richard made estimated tax payments equal to $30,000 for 2020. Richard had qualifying insurance for purposes of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

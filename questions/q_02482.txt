Romeo and Juliet Passage Act 2 Scene 3 : Friar Lawrence's Cell. [Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.] FRIAR 1. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,2. Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;3. And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels4. From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:5. Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,6. The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,7. I must up-fill this osier cage (basket) of ours8. With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.9. The earth, that's nature's mother, is her tomb;10. What is her burying grave, that is her womb:11. And from her womb, children of diverse kind12. We sucking on her natural bosom find;13. Many for many virtues excellent but for some,14. and yet all different.15. O, mickle (much) is the powerful grace that lies16. In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities:17. For naught so vile that on the earth doth live18. But to the earth some special good doth give;19. Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,20. Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:21. Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;22. And vice sometimes by action dignified.23. Within the infant rind of this small flower24. Poison hath residence, and medicine power:25. For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;26. Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.27. Two such opposed kings encamp them still28. In man as well as herbs,--grace and rude will;29. And where the worser is predominant,30. Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.31. [Enter Romeo.]32. ROMEO33. Good morrow, father!34. FRIAR35. Benedicite!36. What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?--37. Young son, it argues a distemper'd head38. So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:39. Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,40. And where care lodges sleep will never lie;41. But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain42. Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:43. Therefore thy earliness doth me assure44. Thou art uprous'd with some distemperature; 45. Or if not so, then here I hit it right,--46. Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.47. ROMEO48. That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.49. FRIAR50. God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?51. ROMEO52. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;53. I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.54. FRIAR55. That's my good son: but where hast thou been then?56. ROMEO57. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.58. I have been feasting with mine enemy;59. Where, on a sudden, one hath wounded me60. That's by me wounded. Both our remedies61. Within thy help and holy physic lies;62. (a physic is a doctor)65. FRIAR66. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;67. Riddling confession (confession like a riddle) finds68. but riddling shrift(forgiveness).69. ROMEO70. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set71. On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:72. As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;73. And all combin'd, save what thou must combine74. By holy marriage: when, and where, and how75. We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,76. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,77. That thou consent to marry us to-day.78. FRIAR79. Holy Saint Francis! what a change is here!80. Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,81. So soon forsaken? young men's love, then, lies82. Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.83. Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine84. Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!85. How much salt water thrown away in waste,86. To season love, that of it doth not taste!87. The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,88. Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears;89. Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit90. Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:91. If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,92. Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline;93. And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then,--94. Women may fall, when there's no strength in men. 95. ROMEO96. Thou chidd'st (to chide is to tell someone off) me97. oft for loving Rosaline.98. FRIAR99. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.100. ROMEO101. And bad'st (told me) me bury love.102. FRIAR103. Not in a grave104. To lay one in, another out to have.105. ROMEO106. I pray thee chide not: she whom I love now107. Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;108. The other did not so.109. FRIAR110. O, she knew well111. Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.112. But come, young waverer, come go with me,113. In one respect I'll thy assistant be;114. For this alliance may so happy prove,115. To turn your households' rancour (hatred) to pure love.116. ROMEO117. O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.118. FRIAR119. Wisely, and slow; they stumble that run fast.120. [Exeunt.]   According to the passage (specifically lines 16-26), which of the following statements about the plants, herbs, and stones is accurate?

A car and a van approach each other at low speeds in a straight, level lane in a parking lot, going in opposite directions. The driver of the car is distracted by their phone and collides head on with the van. Since both drivers are wearing their seatbelts and both vehicles are equipped with airbags, and the speeds are low, neither driver is seriously injured.  Assume that neither driver had time to apply the brakes before or during the collision. Immediately after the collision the two vehicles are stuck to each other, and the wheels are still rolling. The car has mass m=1,400 kg and is moving at v=15.0 mph, and the van has mass M=3,600 kg and is moving at V=10.0 mph. Use a coordinate system where positive vectors point to the right.    a) What is the total momentum of the car and van system (in kg m/s units) before the collision? b) What is the velocity of the car/van immediately after the collision? c) What is the direction of the net force on the car during the collision? Explain in one sentence how you know this. d) What is the direction of the net force on the van during the collision? Explain in one sentence how you know this. e) Which is larger, the magnitude of the acceleration of the car, or the magnitude of the acceleration of the van? Explain in one sentence how you know this.

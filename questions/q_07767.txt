Sputnik I was launched into orbit around Earth in 1957. It had a perigee (the distance from the point of closest approach to the center of Earth) of 6.61 x 106 m and an apogee (the distance from the furthest point in the orbit to the center of Earth) of 7.33 x 106 m. Its mass was 83.5 kg. What was the difference in kinetic energy as it moved from perigee to apogee? The mass of Earth is 5.97 x 1024 kg and

bonus.  Dr. Ko has numerous clinical problems on the left side of his face / head.  Dr. Ko cannot effectively raise his left eyebrow, but he can raise the right one.  He cannot completely close his left eye while keeping his right eye open.  However, he can completely close his right eye while keeping his left eye open without any strain on his left or right eyelid.  When Dr. Ko closes both eyelids, the left one does not completely close unless Dr. Ko makes a slight extra effort to do so.  Dr. Ko cannot produce an even smile and tends to talk out of one side (right) of his mouth.   Dr. Ko's external left ear is deformed but that is a developmental problem, not a neurological issue.  What is interesting for our class is that Dr. Ko has left ear deafness.  That is to say, if you take a tuning fork, strike it, and place it by his right ear Dr. Ko will tell you the sound is coming from his right side.  If you take the tuning fork and place it by his left ear Dr. Ko will tell you that he cannot hear anything.  However, if you place the tuning fork on top of his head (the stem of the tuning fork needs to touch the head) he will tell you that he hears the sound from his left side.  1) Explain the most likely cause of Dr. Ko's physical problems with his left eyelid, left eyebrow, mouth, etc.  2) What explains Dr. Ko's left ear deafness?

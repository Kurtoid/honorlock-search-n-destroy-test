Fact Pattern 3 Joaquin and Summer get married on their commune in Arizona.  Over the next several years, the parties' continue to live in the Arizona desert and have two children, River and Rain.  After 5 years in the desert, the parties relinquish their hippie ways and leave Arizona so that Joaquin can take a job in investment banking in Atlanta, Georgia.  After only 1 year in Atlanta, Joaquin is offered a more prestigious position in mergers and acquisitions in Chicago, Illinois, so he moves the family to a penthouse in Chicago's Loop.  Not long after their move to Chicago, Summer tells Joaquin that she misses their former hippie lifestyle and loathes their current corporate existence.  The two decide to amicably part ways.  They dissolve their marriage and enter into a Shared Parenting Plan for the children in Illinois.  After the end of their marriage, the parties agree to both relocate to Cleveland, Ohio--a city renown for having both a sizable legal and corporate community and a thriving counter-culture scene.  While in Ohio, the parties' increasing differences cause conflict and massive communication problems.  The parties disagree about the children's school (Joaquin's desire for the children to attend a straight-laced private school and Summer's insistence on Montessori), the children's activities (River's football versus pottery class), and the children's medical treatment (whether Rain's ADHD diagnosis should be treated with medication or acupuncture).  A year-and-a-half after their relocation to Cleveland, Joaquin just can't resist a more lucrative offer back in Chicago, so he leaves Summer and the children behind to return to Illinois.  One month after Joaquin relocates back to Chicago, Summer files a Motion to Terminate Shared Parenting Plan in Ohio demanding that she should be the residential parent and legal custodian of the children.  Joaquin files a Motion to Dismiss. 10. Does Joaquin prevail on his Motion to Dismiss? Describe Joaquin's argument and indicate which Court has jurisdiction over River and Rain and why?

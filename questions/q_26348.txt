Fresh Meats, Inc. employed a traveling sale force.  Typically, sales persons would knock on the door of retired elderly homeowners.  They would explain that the elderly resident was being given the opportunity to purchase a freezer and that the price included frozen meats of various types.  As it was explained to the resident, the freezer was a bargain at $1,900 and that price included the "free" meat.  Further, the purchase could pay over time - just 36 monthly payments of $71.00.  The written purchase agreement did not disclose the fact that the effective interest rate under the installment payment method was 20% per year which was a rate much higher than applicable to typical consumer contracts.  In reality, the cost to Fresh Meats for the freezer and the meat was around $600 and a freezer of the type being sold by Fresh Meats could be purchased at Home Depot for around $400.  Also, often the sale person was very high pressure and many customers felt that they had no choice but to buy the freezer with the "free" meat.  Once such elderly resident, Carl Smith, entered into one of these contracts with Fresh Meats and now wants to get out of deal.  Which of the following statements is correct?

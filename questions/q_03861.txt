A highway traffic condition during blizzard is hazardous. Suppose two traffic accidents are expected to occur in each 60 miles of highway on a blizzard day. Assume that the occurrence of traffic accidents along the highway is modeled by a Poisson process.  For a stretch of highway that is 20 miles long, compute: a) The expected value of the number accidents on a blizzard day. b) The probability of no accident on a blizzard day. c) The probability of at least two accidents on a blizzard day. d) The probability of at least 5 accidents on a blizzard day if 2 accidents have already occurred on the day.

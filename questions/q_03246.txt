BONUS QUESTION: (3pts possible) In Drosophila (fruit flies), the eyeless gene is epistatic to the gene for eye color. A recessive mutation in the eyeless gene causes the fly not to develop eyes. A recessive mutation in the eye color gene will cause the fly to have white eyes instead of the typical brick-red color. Consider the cross between a heterozygous red-eyed male fly that is heterozygous for the eyeless mutation and a white-eyed female fly that is also heterozygous for the eyeless mutation. Determine and list all possible phenotypic classes in the offspring from this cross and their relative expected ratios.

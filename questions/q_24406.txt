Marcie Vormohr was Gaylen Byers's neighbor in Portland, Indiana. In May 2018, Vormohr was mowing her yard when she noticed something in her yard; after an inspection, Vormohr realized it was a drone. Vormohr noticed that the drone also had a computer drive attached. Vormohr purchased a reader for the device and plugged the device into her home computer to determine the owner of the drone. Vormohr found video footage on the drive, that depicted a woman "taking out a white baggie, another small baggie with white powder substance in it, and a cut off straw, and Vormohr believed that to probably be drugs." Vormohr also identified Byers on the video, whom she recognized as her neighbor. After observing the video footage, Vormohr turned the device and the drone over to law enforcement due to the video's contents and because she previously had an issue with drones being flown over her property. Vormohr testified that she could not remember the exact date she turned the materials over to law enforcement; however, she believed that it "may have been one or two days" after she discovered the drone. Vormohr was well-known to the Jay County Sheriff's Department. She was known to watch all of her neighbors' homes and to make multiple reports to the Sheriff's Department regarding the host of crimes she perceived. None of her reports every resulted in an arrest or prosecution. However, the Sheriff's Department knew that Vormohr meant well and advised her to contact them at any time when she discovered criminal activity. Deputy Cody Jessee with the Jay County Sheriff's Department testified that he received the drone and, on May 14, 2018, reviewed the video footage. Deputy Jessee observed that the video's last modified date was May 10, 2018, at 9:32 a.m. Based on Deputy Jessee's review of the video footage, Deputy Jessee believed the woman on the video was in possession of illegal substances. Deputy Jessee also observed Byers flying the drone on the video. After reviewing the video footage, Deputy Jessee obtained a search warrant for Byers' home. A search of Byers's home on May 14, 2018, revealed several drug paraphernalia items, including "snorting devices containing a powder like substance in them"; "several empty baggies containing a paw print sticker"; an unlocked safe with "a scattered crystal like substance as well as a cut straw containing a crystal like substance." In a locked safe, which deputies opened, they discovered "a Glock 30 gen 4, .45 Caliber handgun and four empty plastic baggies baring the paw print sticker;" "green plastic baggie with a crystal like substance," which weighed .8 grams in its packaging and tested positive for methamphetamine when field tested. Deputies also found $160.00 in twenty-dollar bills in the safe and an "ink stamp and pad and stamp of a paw print" in Byers' bedroom. In the living room, deputies uncovered "several burnt foils which are used in the consumption of methamphetamine"; a "digital scale under the couch and a glass bowl," which contained a "crushed crystal like substance and a cut red straw" that tested positive for methamphetamine when field tested. Deputies also found with "several feminine items" three cut straws, and three plastic baggies "containing a residue." A search of the bathroom yielded $3,684.00 of cash inside a makeup bag; a box containing baggies with a crystal like substance; and more cut straws. The three baggies weighed approximately 2.4 grams in their packaging and tested positive for methamphetamine when field tested. Deputies believed these items to belong to Jennifer Cook--a woman who was at Byers's home when deputies arrived. Finally, deputies found more burnt foils, burnt marijuana "roaches," snorting devices, another digital scale; and another 2.4 grams of methamphetamine "in its original packaging"; and another weapon loaded with a magazine and additional magazines upstairs. Finally, Byers had $2,003.00 on his person. Byers was arrested and taken to the Jay County Sheriff's Department. Four days after his arrest, Deputies Jessee and Keller travelled to the Fort Wayne City Jail where Byers was being held. Fort Wayne is about 10 miles from the Jay County Sheriff's Department. Byers was brought to the interrogation room. Before the deputies entered the interrogation room, Byers sat alone, and quietly said to himself, "I'm not a criminal. They didn't tell me if I have a lawyer. I know I want to talk to my lawyer now." When Deputies Jessee and Keller entered the room, the following exchange took place: Deputy Jessee: Gaylen, I'm Cody. Byers: How you doing, all right. You already know me. Deputy Jessee: You say-- Deputy Keller: Gaylen, Pat Keller. Deputy Jessee: You say Gaylen or Jaylen? Byers: It--my name is pronounced Gaylen because it's Gaelic. Deputy Jessee: Gaylen. Okay. Deputy Keller: Why don't we swap corners here for a minute, you guys? Go ahead and sit here. Byers: So glad you fellows had a safe trip. Deputy Jessee: Huh? Byers: I'm glad you fellows had a safe trip out here. Deputy Keller: So are we. Huh. Deputy Jessee: Well, we want a safe one back too. Byers: Oh, you know (inaudible). Deputy Jessee: Yeah. Uh, we both, uh--both from, uh, Jay County Sheriff and, uh-- Byers: There wouldn't be any possible way that I could have a--a lawyer present while we do this? Deputy Jessee: Well, uh, what I'll do is, um-- Byers: Yeah, that's what my dad asked me to ask you guys . . . uh, give me a lawyer. Deputy Jessee proceeded as though Byers had said nothing. Byers explained that he was concerned that some police officers "end up switching your words afterwards," to which Deputy Jessee responded that he had no intention of playing any "switch games." Deputy Jessee even produced a tape recorder to allay Byers's fears. As it turns out, the session was videotaped from the outset. Deputy Jessee then explained the situation: Byers and Jennifer Cook were being "charged with the same thing." Deputy Jessee said he already knew "what happened" because the Cook had waived her rights "and laid it out from A to Z." Deputy Jessee reassured Byers that he believed that Byers "did not participate in the drug dealing," but warned that if Byers didn't make a statement right then and there, he wasn't going to be able to "get his version of it" because "most all attorneys--in fact, all attorneys will--will sometimes or usually advise you not to make a statement." Deputy Jessee said he didn't really "need your statement to make the case" anyway because he "already had two and a half other complete statements," reiterating that he already "knew what happened" and had the hard evidence to back it up. At this point Deputy Jessee read Byers his rights under Miranda. Byers hesitated, shrugged his shoulders, and said, "let's talk," proceeding to implicate himself in the crime. On June 13, 2018, the State charged Byers with Count I, dealing in methamphetamine, a Level 2 felony; Count II, possession of methamphetamine, a Level 4 felony; Count III, maintaining a common nuisance, a Level 6 felony; and Count IV, possession of marijuana, a Class B misdemeanor. The trial court admitted the drone video, the results of the search of Byers's home, and Byers's statement over defense objection. The court of appeals reversed on all grounds and remanded for a new trial. The Supreme Court of the United States granted the State's petition for a writ of certiorari to review this matter. You are counsel for either the Government or Byers and are assigned to write the brief to the Supreme Court of the United States. You should address all of the issues raised in this case.

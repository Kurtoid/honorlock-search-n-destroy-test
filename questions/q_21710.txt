Each pond had identical volumes of water with the same salinity and ph, access to light and identical brands of fish food.  The recommended food requirement for koi in captivity is 30 mg twice per day.  Koi in pond A were given 15 mg twice per day, pond B koi were given 30 mg twice per day and koi in pond C were given 45 mg twice per day.

Refer to the following Case Study which pertains to unintended consequences of an Arizona state law. Case Study: The goal of an immigration law in the state of Arizona, SB1070 (2010), was to discourage illegal immigration by making it a crime under state law, and directing law enforcement to check immigration status for anyone legally stopped if there was "reasonable suspicion" of illegal status. In addition, it authorized arrest without warrant if the officer had "probable cause" to believe that an offense had been committed, and resulted in the removal of a non-citizen. Most experts believe that this law resulted in a significant decline in the illegal immigrant population in Arizona. If illegal immigrants are a dominate work group in the construction industry in Arizona, what would the effect of this law be on wages for construction workers and new home production costs?

Astor was involved in an automobile accident.  Peter was a passenger in his car and was seriously injured.  At the time of the accident Astor was driving 30 miles over the speed limit.  Astor lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a fire hydrant.  Astor argues that he lost control of his car (which was manufactured by GM) because of a defect in the car's all-wheel drive system and not because of any negligence on his part.  Peter has sued Astor and GM based on the following claims of negligence: Astor was negligent in the operation of his motor vehicle, and GM was negligent in the design and manufacture of Astor's car. Assume that the jury found that Peter has suffered $100,000 of damages and that she was 10% contributorily negligent for failing to wear a seat belt.  The jury also found Astor was 80% negligent and GM 10% negligent.  The accident occurred in Wisconsin and the trial took place in Wisconsin.  Which of the following statements is correct?

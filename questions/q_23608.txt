The widespread use--and perhaps overuse--of antibiotic drugs in recent decades has increased the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  The prevention and treatment of infections by these particularly dangerous bacterial strains is among the most serious problems facing doctors and hospitals today.  For each of the following statements determine the type of parameter it is estimating.     Infection by resistant bacteria is more common in America than in Europe: American hospitals saw 26.9 cases per year, compared to only 21.1 for European hospitals. [2means]   Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a particularly dangerous strain:  11.2% of hospital patients infected with MRSA died while in the hospital, compared to 2.3% of other hospital patients. [2prop]   Infection by resistant bacteria frequently occurs outside of hospitals: 85% of cases occur outside of a healthcare setting. [oneprop]   A group of hospitals compared the frequency of infection by resistant bacteria before and after implementing more strict sanitation protocols: In these hospitals, the number of cases per year dropped from 23.1 to 18.8. [matched]   Even when patients survive, these infections can result in long hospital stays: The average hospital stay for one such type of infection is 14.3 days. [onemean]

Read the following selection from "College Has Its Own Language and Customs." Then, based on your reading of the selection, choose the most appropriate answer to the question that follows the selection. You may be asked additional questions about the same passage. College Has Its Own Language and Customs Going to college--even if you are not far from home--is a cultural experience. It comes with its own language and customs, some of which can be confusing or confounding at first. Just like traveling to a foreign country, it is best if you prepare by learning what words mean and what you are expected to say and do in certain situations. Let's first start with the language you may encounter. In most cases, there will be words that you have heard before, but they may have different meanings in a college setting. Take, for instance, "office hours." If you are not in college, you would think that it means the hours of a day that an office is open. If it is your dentist's office, it may mean Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. In college, "office hours" can refer to the specific hours a professor is in her office to meet with students, and those hours may be only a few each day: for example, Mondays and Wednesdays from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. "Syllabus" is another word that you may not have encountered, but it is one you will soon know very well. A syllabus is often called the "contract of the course" because it contains information about what to expect--from the professor and the student. It is meant to be a roadmap for succeeding in the class. Understanding that office hours are for you to ask your professor questions and the syllabus is the guide for what you will be doing in the class can make a big difference in your transition to college. The table on Common College Terms, has a brief list of other words that you will want to know when you hear them on campus. Common College Terms, What They Mean, and Why You Need to Know     Term   What It Means   Why You Need to Know       Attendance policy   A policy that describes the attendance and absence expectations for a class   Professors will have different attendance expectations. Read your syllabus to determine which ones penalize you if you miss too many classes.     Final exam   A comprehensive assessment that is given at the end of a term   If your class has a final exam, you will want to prepare for it well in advance by reading assigned material, taking good notes, reviewing previous tests and assignments, and studying.     Learning   The process of acquiring knowledge   In college, most learning happens outside the classroom. Your professor will only cover the main ideas or the most challenging material in class. The rest of the learning will happen on your own.     Office hours   Specific hours professor is in the office to meet with students   Visiting your professor during office hours is a good way to get questions answered and to build rapport.     Plagiarism   Using someone's words, images, or ideas as your own, without proper attribution   Plagiarism carries much more serious consequences in college, so it is best to speak to your professor about how to avoid it and review your student handbook's policy.     Study   The process of using learning strategies to understand and recall information   Studying in college may look different than studying in high school in that it may take more effort and more time to learn more complex material.     Syllabus   The contract of a course that provides information about course expectations and policies   The syllabus will provide valuable information that your professor will assume you have read and understood. Refer to it first when you have a question about the course.       Attribution:Access for free at https://openstax.org/books/college-success/pages/1-introduction Taken from Baldwin, Amy.

31. Working under a Contract and Letter of Instructions from the U.S. Surveyor General, a Deputy Public Lands Surveyor in the mid-19th century, working in Central Florida, is subdividing Townships into Sections under standard instructions for Half-Mile-Post procedures. The USPLSS field notes indicate adherence to the Half-Mile-Post order of surveys, but when setting the Post at 40 chains, he notes in the field book (every time) "SET  1/4  SECTION POST", and then does NOT show any correction after closure on the existing monument.   The true position of the North  1/4  corner of a section in this instance is (choose one): Final note: I warned you about question 6!  As an SFRC Student, I encourage you to read his book "A Naturalist In Florida", along with other Authors, like  "A Land Remembered", "If Nothin' Don' Happen" and "The Trouble Of It Is"
The objective of the exam is to discuss/propose the system design choices for a selection of robotic systems. The discussion is expected to focus on how tools presented in the class could be used to implement the selected applications. Examples of topic to discuss include: perception, perception processing, control, localization, source of uncertainties, particular challenges... This list is not exhaustive, and some of the topics may not apply to a particular system. Here are the sub-questions to answer for each system:  Locomotion: description of the kinematics and challenges of the direct and inverse kinematics. (2pts) Perception: description of the perception needs and sensor setup. (2pts). Environment Mapping: description of the type of map to be used, the sensor used to update it, and the update principle. (2pts) Localisation and State Estimation: description of the state to be estimated and the technique to estimate it. If using a Bayesian filter, list of the relevant functions. (2pts) Control: Type of control challenges, possible solutions, issues foreseen. (2pts) Any other system specific comments/remarks. (2 extra points if relevant)

A grinding wheel is in the form of a uniform solid disk with a radius of 6.93 cm and a mass of 2.05 kg. It starts from rest and accelerates uniformly under the action of the constant torque of 0.592 N * m that the motor exerts on the wheel. How long does the wheel take to reach its final operating speed of 1280 rev/min? Moment of Inertia of Solid Disk about the center of mass axis is;

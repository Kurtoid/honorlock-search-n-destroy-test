Savannah (age 25) has had difficulty regulating her emotions since she was young. She is quick to experience negative emotions, particularly anger and depression. During these times, she may impulsively lash out and scream at or even physically assault others. Sometimes when Savannah is particularly dysregulated, she will become suspicious and paranoid that her friends are deceiving her or trying to harm her in some way.  As a result, Savannah's relationships do not tend to last and she experiences significant interpersonal problems. However, after damaging her relationship with others, Savannah will do anything she can to make amends and retain the relationship, even impulsively splurging on large and expensive gifts. Furthermore, Savannah is also quick to alter her interests, goals, and values. This is not because she is trying to fit in with others, but more because she doesn't have a stable sense of who she really is or wants to be as a person. Savannah has never had any other symptoms of abnormal functioning. What disorder does Savannah have?

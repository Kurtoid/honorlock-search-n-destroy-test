ABC Company produces 8,000 parts each year, which are used in the production of one of its products. The unit product cost of a part is $36, computed as follows:       Variable production cost   $16     Fixed production cost   $20     Unit product cost   $36     The parts can be purchased from an outside supplier for only $28 each. The space in which the parts are now produced would be idle and fixed production costs would be reduced by one-fourth. Based on these data, the financial advantage (disadvantage) of purchasing the parts from the outside supplier would be:

Digestion and Absorption Hybrid Input a letter only, nothing else. Use the answer bank below. Each macronutrient is digested and absorbed in a slightly different way. In general the enzymes that digest carbohydrates are called: [42](42), those that breakdown fats are called:[43](43), and those that breakdown proteins are called:[44](44). Before absorption can occur carbohydrates must be broken down into their most basic building block called: [chemical1] and proteins must be broken down into their most basic building block called: [chemical2]. Both carbohydrates and proteins once broken down into their most basic building blocks are absorbed via the use of the concentration gradient of [45] (45), Lipid digestion in the small intestine begins with [46](46) breaking down large lipid globules then is completed in the small intestine by [47] (47) which breaks down lipids into even smaller fat droplets that have to be carried in special carriers called: [48](48)  to be dumped into the intestinal cells. When digested lipids leave the intestinal cells and go into the lymph they are carried in a different carrier called [49] (49). Finally lipids are converted into cholesterols by the liver.

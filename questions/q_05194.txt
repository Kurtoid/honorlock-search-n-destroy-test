All of the following are true about the NIH, EXCEPT
Let Y be the response variable, X be a regressor. It happens that X has 4 levels (4 distinct values) and at each level there are 4 response observations. Therefore, there are a total of 16 observations. The following graph shows that X and Y has a linear relationship. A simple linear regression model is fitted and the computer outputs are given below.    Compute the following values: (3 points for each question in (1)-(10), numbers are rounded to the second decimal place.) (1) F value of the regression model = ________________ (2) Sum of squares of lack-of-fit = _______________ (3) Mean square of lack-of-fit = ______________ (4) F value of lack-of-fit = _____________ (5) t value of intercept = ___________ (6) Estimate of slope = _______________ (7) R-square = _____________ (8) R-square-adjusted = __________________ (9) S = ______________ (10) The predicted response value at X=220 is ________________ (11) Explain the concept of pure error and why it is a model-independent estimate of sigma-square. (3 points) (12) The plot of studentized residual vs. y-hat is show below. What problem is revealed by this plot? (3 points)  (13) To the problem in (12), provide two possible solutions (6 points).

Consider the definition of the Measurable interface and the code snippet defining the Inventory class: public interface Measurable { double getMeasure(); } public class Inventory implements Measurable { private int onHandCount; . . . double getMeasure() { return onHandCount; } } The compiler complains that the getMeasure method has a weaker access level than the Measurable interface. Why?

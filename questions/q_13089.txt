Below is an excerpt from the CCG's guidance: As health professionals one of our key aims is to reduce the risk of avoidable harm to our patients. Some people are at increased risk of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), for example those with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), heart failure, or those taking particular medications. Health care professionals should provide advice to such patients that certain drugs should be temporarily discontinued during acute intercurrent illnesses, particularly where there is disturbed fluid balance. This advice is commonly described as 'sick day rules' or to take a 'drug holiday'.  The definition of 'acute illness' in this context has to be simple enough to be understood by patients at risk. For example: 'when you are unwell with any of the following; vomiting or diarrhoea (unless minor) fevers, sweats and shaking' Is Mrs VH at risk of an AKI? How should the 'sick day rules' be applied to her? (4 marks)

GatorFox Browser - Part 1 Most web browsers record the user's website navigation history. As part of this, these browsers allow the users to go forward and backward in their website navigation history. For example, Google Chrome has forward and backward arrows in the top left that allow the user undo/redo webpage visits. Clicking the backward arrow reverts the browser to the previous page. Clicking the forward arrow navigates the browser to the first page in the "forward" history. When the user visits a new website, the "forward" history is cleared. When the user decides to go backward, "forward" history is created.  Consider this example:  You navigate to "google.com" as a NEW_PAGE action. You navigate to "ufl.edu" as a NEW_PAGE action. You navigate to "youtube.com" as a NEW_PAGE action. You navigate back to "ufl.edu" using the BACK action. You navigate back to "google.com" using the BACK action. You navigate forward to "ufl.edu" using the FORWARD action. You navigate to "facebook.com" as a NEW_PAGE action. (The forward history is now cleared)  If you were the designer of the GatorFox browser, which data structure[s] will you use to optimally implement the user navigation history component?

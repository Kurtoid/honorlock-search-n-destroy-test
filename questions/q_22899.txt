Problem No.2 For the beam structure shown below the data is as follows: P= 9.6-kN, L = 6-m, d= 2.4-m, b=100-mm, t=30-mm h=150-mm and h1=130-mm.  Neglect the self-weight of the beam. Based on this information answer the following question: Question 2.4:  What is the maximum shear force in the beam? [Enter value in kN and m as appropriate]
For the relationship represented in the figure below, which of the following is true?
Test suite minimization Consider the program and the test suite T given below.    Test cases format - tk: (i value, j value) T = {t1 : (-1;-1); t2 : (-1;0); t3 : (-1;1); t4 : (0;-1); t5 : (0;0)} Find a minimum test set that satisfies the branch (edge) coverage. Use the test minimization algorithm discussed in the class to minimize T. Clearly show your work to get the full credit.

A patient is experiencing an increased level of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). What should the nurse consider is occurring with this patient? Select all that apply.
Let A = {0, 2, 4, 6}, C = {1, 3, 5, 7}. Find .
Light can only perform work in chloroplasts when the light energy is absorbed. Substances that absorb visible light are known as pigments. Different pigments absorb light of different wavelengths. Briefly explain why violet-blue light and red light work best for photosynthesis reactions yet leaves appear green to us.

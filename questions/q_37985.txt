Part 2: Apply Apply the "twin tests" of narrative rationality to the story below. Is the Fairy Land Sheriff likely to believe Papa Bruins' story? Use the theory's concepts to justify your response.  Papa Bruins just came to the Fairy Land Sherriff's office to report a crime. The Sherriff listens to Papa's account of what happened. He claimed that the family was burglarized by a little girl!

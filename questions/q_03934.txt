A resistor R1 = 5.00 O and a resistor R2 = 9.00 O are connected in parallel. A third resistor R3 = 4.00 O is then connected in series with this parallel combination. An ideal battery of V = 6.00 V  is then connected across the series-parallel combination of the three resistors. a) Draw the circuit. Label the resistors as R1, R2, R3, and the battery V. b) What is the total resistance RTotal of this circuit? c) What is the total current ITotal out of the battery? d) What are the values of the currents I1, I2, and I3 through the resistors R1, R2, and R3? e) What are the values of the voltages V1, V2, and V3 across the resistors R1, R2, and R3? f) What are the power dissipated in resistors R1, R2, R3 and the power provided by the battery?

(Continues from the preceding question.) Hereditary (or familial) HCM is an inherited, autosomal dominant trait. Over 1,500 different mutations have been associated with HCM. These can be single-point mutations, insertion or deletion mutations, or truncations, but they each result in an error in one of at least 20 genes important for sarcomere function. In normal gene expression, the genes in [GeneLocation] encode [EncodedProduct] molecules, which carry out the functions necessary for life. In the simplest sense, gene expression has two major steps: The first step of gene expression is [Process1], in which the genetic information is transferred to [Step1]. During this process, the [Sequence] sequence of a gene serves as a template for complementary base-pairing, and an enzyme called [Enzyme] catalyzes the formation of a molecule that is processed to form a single-stranded copy of the gene. The second step in gene expression is [Process2], in which the product from the first step (above) is "read" to assemble [Monomers] in a specific order according to the genetic code. This step is performed by specialized organelles called [Organelles]. The gene products associated with familial HCM are cytosolic, and therefore they [Cytosolic] created in rough endoplasmic reticulum.

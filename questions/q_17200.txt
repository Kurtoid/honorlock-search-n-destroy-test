Identify and fix all the mistakes in the following code snippet swaps the order of the occurrence of even and odd words. For example, if vec = [22 11 44 66 33], then it swaps the order of even numbers which are in order  22 44 66  such that now they occur like  66 44 22. Similarly, the odd numbers 11  33 will now occur like 33 11. So the final result will be [66 33 44 22 11] (note that here the order of even and odd numbers is opposite as compared to the original order in vec but they retain their original sequence of the positions of even and odd numbers. So where you had an odd number earlier, you will still have the odd number there, but it maybe a different odd number. Same goes for positions where there are even numbers).  Another example, if vec = [3 2 4 2 8 9 7], then the updated vec will be [7 8 2 4 2 9 3] To write your response, mention the line number followed by the incorrect code in the line and then the correct code. For example: Line 2: for ii=1:1:5 should be for ii=2:1:10 (this is just an example!). Note: you cannot write completely new lines of code.       clc; clear; vec = input('Enter the vector: ');  even = []; odd =[];  for ii = 1:1:length(vec)-1      if mod(ii, 2) == 0           even = [even ii];      else            odd = [odd ii];      end end  vec(even) = vec(even(1:1:end)); vec(odd) = vec(odd(1:1:end));  disp(even);

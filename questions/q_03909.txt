In rabbits, fur color is controlled by one gene.  The gene has two different alleles: A dominant allele (B) that produces black fur, and a recessive allele (b) that produces brown fur. A second gene controls distribution of melanin in the fur: A dominant allele (D) produces uniform distribution, and a recessive allele (d) produces banded distribution. The two genes are linked and on an autosome. In your answer, assume that NO recombination occurs between alleles. In the P generation, a true-breeding male rabbit with black fur and banded distribution is crossed to a true-breeding female rabbit with brown fur and uniform distribution. What is the genotype of the male rabbit in the P generation? [genotype1] What is the genotype of the female rabbit in the P generation? [genotype2] What would be the genotype of the offspring in the F1 generation? [genotype3] What would be the phenotype of these offspring? [phenotype] The offspring in the F1 generation were allowed to mate with one another.  What ratio of phenotype combinations would you expect to observe in the F2 generation? [ratio] If one of the offspring from the F1 generation were crossed to a brown fur and banded distribution, what percentage of their offspring would have black fur and banded distribution? [percentage]

Geometrically necessary dislocation is the important concept in strain hardening. (a) (10 pts) In your own words, please explain the difference between statistically stored dislocations and geometrically necessary dislocations. Please be brief. (b) (10 pts) In polycrystalline material, the grains were confined by other grains, as shown in the figure. Please use geometrically necessary dislocation to explain why the deformation along boundaries does not produce void formation along grain boundary, leading to grain disassembly. Please be brief.    (c) (10 pts) Nanoindentation is the technique to evaluate material's hardness by indenting a diamond tip on metal surface.  Geometrically necessary dislocation also forms during nanoindentation, as shown in the schematic below (It is just a drawing I got from Wiki.  The dislocation does not need to be arranged like this).  Please explain: (c-1) how can geometrically necessary dislocation affect your indentation hardness measurement result? (c-2) If you conduct the nanoindentation on both FCC polycrystalline material and single crystal material with slip plane parallel to the indentation direction (illustrated below), which material will be affected the most by the geometrically necessary dislocation.

General Mills is launching a new cereal, Apple Cinnamon Chex and claims that eating it can help people lose weight. The table shows the weight (in pounds) of ten patients before eating the cereal and after one year of eating the cereal as part of their diets. Use technology to test the mean difference. Assume the samples are random and  dependent, and the population is normally distributed. At a=0.05 , can you conclude that eating Apple Cinnamon Chex results in weight loss?      Before (lbs) 240 165 119 180 151 299 134 180 147 105   After (lbs) 250 160 117 160 144 272 142 180 150 103      Answer the following: a) State the claim mathematically and verbally. b) Identify the null and alternative hypotheses. c) Is the claim the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis? d) Specify the level of significance. e) Which test are you going to perform? f) Which distribution is used in the test? g) What are the requirements for the test and how do you know the requirements are satisfied? h) Find the P-value and explain what it means for this problem. i) Are you performing a left-tailed, right-tailed or two-tailed test? j) Make a decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. k) Interpret your decision in the context of the original claim using complete sentences.

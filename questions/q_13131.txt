Given the following road map as shown in class. Consider a search tree (the root node has depth 0) that illustrates the state-space explored by A* starting from the city Timisoara (T). Answer questions about the search tree below. The nodes are labeled using the first letter of the names of the cities on the map. Remember, nodes that have already been explored should not be explored again.   Use the Straight-line distance in the table shown above for the estimated cost h(n) between node n and the node of the final destination B for Bucharest. Use g(n) as the true cost from the origin to node n. Remember that A* uses f(n) = h(n) + g(n) to estimate the total cost from the origin to the destination. Compute the f value of the following nodes that may or may not be part of the search tree. Enter a numerical value only. Nothing else will be recognized. L, f= [f_L] M, f=[f_M] Z, f = [f_Z] D, f=[f_D] R, f=[f_R]

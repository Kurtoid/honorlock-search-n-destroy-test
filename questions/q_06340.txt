As part of a pre-season assessment of professional athletes, an exercise physiologist performed sophisticated tests of hamstring flexibility and hip range of motion to determine muscle stiffness and elastic modulus.  The measurements of two athletes are listed below and allow the following conclusion: Athlete A  height: 6'10'' hamstring stiffness: 150 kPa/m Range of motion (hip flexion): 150o Femur length: 65 cm    Athlete B height: 6.0' hamstring stiffness: 150 kPa/m Range of motion (hip flexion): 120o  Femur length: 50 cm   Notes. 1) kPa = tension in kN/m2 2) The best way to answer this question is to run a "test" where you perform the same stretch (i.e., change in muscle length) on both athletes.

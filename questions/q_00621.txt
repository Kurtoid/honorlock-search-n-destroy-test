Plaintiff and Defendant were engaged in a bitter commercial dispute. Defendant's attorney filed a counterclaim and planned to "wage a war of attrition" in the hopes that Plaintiff would abandon the suit due to the costs. At the same time, Plaintiff told Partner to take a "scorched earth approach" and to deny any requests for continuances or extensions.   Later in the case, Defendant's attorney filed a request for a two-week extension of time to reply to the Plaintiff's fifth request of production of documents. Defendant's attorney responded to the other four requests and all other discovery on time. Defendant's attorney had a vacation that was planned over a year ago and was unable to prepare the response before leaving. She had previously informed Partner of her vacation. Partner refused to agree to the extension. Defendant's attorney moved the court for an extension, which was granted and resulted in the court admonishing Partner for failing to agree to a reasonable extension and awarding attorney's fees to Defendant.   Is Partner subject to discipline for refusing the request for the extension of time?

Based on the game-theoretic framework developed by Timur Kuran in his article "Now Out of Never," imagine that the two sets below represent the participation thresholds of a 10-member society. A is the society at time 1, and A* is the society after one member of that society's participation threshold (i.e. their threshold for participating in anti-regime protests) drops from 20 to 10. What is the consequence of this change?   A = {0, 20, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100} A* = {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100}

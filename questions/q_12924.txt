Tetanus, which is also referred to as "lockjaw" is caused by the Gram-positive bacteria, Clostridium tetani.   Individuals usually get infected when they step on a contaminated object when walking bare-footed outside.  This allows the spores of C. tetani to enter the wound.  The spore itself does not make a person sick.  Instead,  the spores enter a vegetative state and secrete tetanus toxin, which prevents motor neurons from functioning properly.  This causes skeletal muscles to "lock" into place due to severe muscle spasms (contraction).  It is recommended that infants, children, teens, and adults receive the tetanus vaccine every ten years to prevent this painful and potentially deadly disease.    Q1: Tetanus is a [Q1] disease. Q3: The toxin mentioned is [Q3]. Q4: Which of the following would be considered a reservoir for C. tetani? [Q4]   Q6: What is the portal of entry of C. tetani? [Q6]. Q7: What is the portal of exit of C. tetani? [Q7]

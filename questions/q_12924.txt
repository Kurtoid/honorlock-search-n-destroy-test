You are studying the Serotonin transporter (SERT) that pumps the neurotransmitter, serotonin, out of the synapse (extracellular) back into the cytosol of the pre-synaptic neuron. Prozac is in a class of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) that effectively block reuptake of serotonin from the synapse thereby prolonging the effect of serotonin release. To characterize this type of transport, you measure the rate of transport of serotonin and two other neurotransmitters, and compile the following table given below. Based on the data in the table below, what statement about the Serotonin transporter (SERT) is TRUE?

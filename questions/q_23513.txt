Short answer Instructions-   On this exam you must answer a single free response question.  The question is worth 10  points, be as concise as possible.     Stated below is the primary structure of a small peptide that is known to form an a-helix.  Using this sequence answer the following questions:   +H3N-RKMVDILKR-COO-    How many peptide bonds exist in this protein (1 point)? ___________ What would the charge of this a-helix be at pH 8.5 (assume pK's remain constant)? (2 points) ___________ Using the diagram below, would you say that this helix is amphipathic? If your answer is yes, state the number (residue #1 or #2 for example) of the residues that are hydrophilic (assume R represents residue #1 in the diagram)? (3 points) ___________ Finally, if I were to replace the 5th amino acid with a K side chain would this have any effect on the formation of the helix at pH of 13? How about pH of 7? Why do you think so for both pH's? (4 points)

Five 1-inch cubes of carrot were placed in separate beakers, each containing a different initial concentration of sucrose solution.  The membranes of carrot cells are impermeable to sucrose. At 10-minute intervals, the carrot cubes were removed, blotted to get rid of excess moisture, and their mass was measured. The percent change in mass of each carrot cube was graphed as shown below.   At the end of the experiment, your colleague presents you with a list of concentrations that were used in the experiment.  He confesses that he didn't label the beakers, so he doesn't know which beaker held which concentration of sucrose.  The concentrations used were: 0.2M sucrose, 0.4M sucrose, 0.6M sucrose, 0.8 M sucrose, 1.0M sucrose   Answer the questions below using the provided data   A.  Which beaker contained the most hypotonic solution? [mosthypotonic] B.  Which beaker contained the most hypertonic solution? [mosthypertonic] C.  Which beaker contained solution that was isotonic to the cells? [isotonic] D.  What molarity of sucrose did Beaker D contain? [beakerD] E.  What molarity of sucrose did Beaker E contain? [beakerE]

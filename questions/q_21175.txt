FIGURE 8-6An object was a mass of 10.0 kg is at rest at the top of a frictionless inclined plane of length 8.00 m and an angle of inclination 30.0deg with the horizontal. The object is released from this position and it stops at a distance d from the bottom of the inclined plane along a horizontal surface, as shown in Fig. 8-6. The coefficient of kinetic friction for the horizontal surface of 0.400.(a) What is the kinetic energy of the object at the bottom of the inclined plane?(b) What is the speed of the object at the bottom of the inclined plane?(c) At what horizontal distance from the bottom of the inclined plane will this object stop?

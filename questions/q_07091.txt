Choose one of the topics below on which to write your final exam essay. Since you will be typing in Canvas, you will not be able to set up your answer in MLA format, so instead, type your name at the top, hit enter, type a title for your essay, hit enter, and begin your essay. Include a space between paragraphs rather than trying to indent the first line of each paragraph. Quotes and citations, however, do need to be in correct MLA format. Topics:  Analyze the changing poetic voice as revealed through Dickinson's "I Could Not Stop for Death," Frost's "Out, Out -," and Eliot's "The Waste Land." Focus on the speakers and their discussions of death. Come to a conclusion on what their different voices divulge about the ever-altering poetic outlook on life and death. Use specific examples of the poems throughout the essay that support your ideas. Remember, do not only discuss the subject matter of the poems. Look at what that subject matter reveals about the different voices of these poets.     Analyze how the three genres Romanticism, Realism or Naturalism (pick one, not both), and Post-Modernism affected how American identity is revealed through the literature we have covered this semester. You should address the characteristics of each of these literary movements and how those characteristics reflect the changing American identity. Your emphasis should be on the change of American identity from one work to the next based on the ever-evolving society and its impact on the individual's sense of self. You must choose at least one assigned work from each volume (C, D, and E). Include any historical or cultural events that were also influential to these literary movements and/or the changing American identity.

CASE 1: Please answer the next two questions using this case scenario. You are called to evaluate a 1-year-old Angus heifer with history of unilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge and asymmetric distortion of the face above the right eye. The owner tells you that the heifer was surgically dehorned 2 months ago. About a week ago, he describes the heifer keeping her head down and shaking her head. The owner noticed a bump above her right eye and he reports the heifer is not eating well. The owner has treated this heifer with Oxytetracycline, Tulathromycin, and Florfenicol without response to treatment. At physical examination, TPR is normal but she is depressed and holds her head down. Evident mucopurulent nasal discharge is coming out the right nostril and the frontal bone above the right eye seems distorted. What is the most likely differential diagnosis for this heifer?
Case/Scenario 1 Unit Goals: * Students will analyze the qualities of a good friend. * Students will read about a variety of friendships, from destructive to healthy, and make connections between literature and real-life experiences. * Students will write a comparative essay about the similarities and differences between healthy and destructive friendships. Project Directions: A primary assignment in Ms. Manning's friendship unit involves students responding to two texts: Give a Boy a Gun by Todd Strasser and Freak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick. The friends in Give a Boy a Gun have a destructive relationship that culminates in a school shooting and massacre. The friends in Freak the Mighty are an unlikely pair who share a mutually rewarding friendship, even though they are very different. After reading and discussing each of the texts form a variety of perspectives and levels, the students are given an assignment to reflect on the friendships in the literature and to write a series of five to seven interview questions to ask a peer and a family member about friendships - both destructive and healthy ones.  Project Assessment Criteria: Ms. Manning established the following guidelines for an exemplary comparative essay: 1. Three to four in-text citations about Freak the Mighty and Give a Boy a Gun that use quotation marks and other punctuation properly and include a page number. 2.

Five to seven interview questions that pursue deeper, higher-level understanding of destructive and healthy friendships. 4. Conducted interviews with a family member and a peer (evidence of interview notes attached). 5. Typewritten, double-spaced, two-paragraph comparative essay. The first paragraph describes the nature of healthy friendships with details/supports from the texts and interviews.

PROBLEM A Use this scenario to answer this question and the next few questions. Scenario Lola Chiko: Although her product is illegal, Lola Chiko operates her drug enterprise according to the sound business practices she learned in Econ 1110. She has two sets of customers, experimenters and addicts, and she has no competitors for this particular nasty drug. The demand schedules for each customer market per day are listed below.

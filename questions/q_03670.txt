Question 41 (2 points) Angelo is very delinquent on his child support payments and knows that there is a warrant out for his arrest. When an officer attempts to pull him over for speeding, Angelo decides that he needs to "get away." So instead of slowing down, he accelerates and tries to elude the officer, who then chases him. Angelo drives at speeds up to 90 mph and runs three red lights. When other officers attempt to stop him by blocking the highway, Angelo manages to get through, but the officer pursuing him crashes into another officer's patrol car, and both are killed. Angelo did not want anyone to die and had hoped that no one would get hurt. And he allowed himself to be arrested without further incident later that same day.   Can Angelo be properly convicted of murder under MPC SS 210.2.? Why or why not? (1-3 sentences)

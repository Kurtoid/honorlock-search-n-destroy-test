The initial charges on the three identical metal spheres in the figure are the following: sphere A, Q A  ; sphere B, Q B  ; and sphere C, Q C  . Spheres A and B are fixed in place, with a center-to-center separation of d, which is much larger than the spheres. At this moment the electrostatic force between spheres A and B is F 0  . Then sphere C first touches sphere B before it is completely discharged. It then touches sphere A and is then removed. If the magnitude of the electrostatic force between spheres A and B has now doubled, what was the ratio between Q C  /Q B initially.

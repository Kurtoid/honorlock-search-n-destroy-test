Given a positive integer n, the following rules will always create a sequence that ends with 1, called the hailstone sequence:  If n is even, divide it by 2 If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 (i.e. 3n +1) Continue until n is 1  Write a function that takes an integer n as input and prints the hailstone sequence starting with the integer entered. Format the output so that ten integers, each separated by a tab character (t), are printed per line. The output format can be achieved as follows: System.out.print(n + "t"); Ex: If the input is: 25  the output is: 25 76 38 19 58 29 88 44 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 Note: you don't need to implement a main method.

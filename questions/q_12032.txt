Write an equivalent lambda expression that implements the functional interface T1 that could be used to replace the anonymous inner class given below. An example inner anonymous class implementation is given below. The body of the implementation must match the implementation given. Note: you only need to write the lambda expression NOT the entire block of code below. public class Stardew {    public static void main(String[] args) {        Stardew myStardew = new Stardew ();        myStardew.doStuff(new T1() {            public double power(double base, double exp) {                return Math.pow(base, exp);            }        });    }    public void doStuff(T1 t1) {        System.out.println(t1.power(2, 9));    } } interface T1 {    public double power(double base, double exp); }  Make sure to select the 'Preformatted' style from the dropdown so your code is formatted clearly.  DO NOT USE THE TAB KEY WHEN WRITING CODE AS YOU MAY ACCIDENTALLY SUBMIT YOUR EXAM. USE THE SPACE BAR INSTEAD.

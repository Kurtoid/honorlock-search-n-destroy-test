Please read the following experimental description and answer questions Q26- Q30 You design an experiment to investigate the potential interacting effects of time between practice sessions and the number of practice session on dart throwing accuracy.   Number of practice sessions is a between group factor with three levels (2, 3, or 4 sessions) Time in between sessions is a between group factor with 3 levels (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week).  Observations of accuracy are made via a performance test once a subject has completed all of their assigned training.

Design an Armstrong FM modulator to generate an FM with a carrier frequency of 200 MHz, the message signal is bandlimited to B=25 kHz and frequency deviation of 100K Hz. A narrow-band FM generator is available at a carrier frequency of 100 KHz and a frequency deviation of 125 Hz. The stock room has an oscillator with frequency up to 5 Mhz, a BPF with adjustable central frequency up to 5.5MHz and bandwidth up to 1MHz, and four frequency multipliers (three double (2) and two (10)s). Fill in the blanks for Frequency multipliers M1[M1],  M2[M2] ,   Modulation index=[index],  Carson bandwidth=[Band] KHz. {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 20, 40, 50, 100, 250, 500 }  Sketch the following  design and spectrum and submit them in Question 5, 3 pt total.  Draw diagram and show all design parameters for example, central frequency and bandwidth for BPF, frequency of oscillator, and frequency multipliers (2pts) Sketch spectrum of this FM signal for input signal of m(t)=

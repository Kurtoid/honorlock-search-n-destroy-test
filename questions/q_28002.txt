Three forces are applied to an equilateral triangle with a distance from the center to any vertex of 0.350-m. The force at one vertex, 11.9 N, is along the line from the center to the vertex. The next force, 8.50, at the second vertex is at right angles in the counterclockwise direction to the line connecting the center to that vertex. The force, 14.6 N, at the third vertex makes a clockwise angle of 40.0o with line connecting the center to that vertex. What is the net torque on the wheel due to these three forces for an axis perpendicular to the equilateral triangle and passing through its center?

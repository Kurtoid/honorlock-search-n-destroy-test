Possibly useful equations:  Triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) catalyzes the isomerization of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate:           The KM for TIM for its substrate (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) is 32 mM. When [S} = 24 mM, the rate of the reaction (vo) is 7.33 x 104 mM/s. Please add units to numerical answers. Note: 1 mM = 10-6 M.    Blank #1: What class of enzyme is TIM (lyase, oxidoreductase, hydrolase, transferase, isomerase, or ligase)?  Blank #2: What is vmax for TIM? Blank #3: Assuming the TIM concentration in this experiment was 3 mM, what is the turnover number (s-1) for TIM? Blank #4: Does TIM approach "catalytic perfection"? (yes/no). Note: "catalytic perfection" occurs at 108 - 109 M-1s-1 Blank #5: What determines the ultimate speed limit of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction? In other words, what is it that imposes the physical limit on catalytic perfection?

TEST 5490/4495-4    Spring 2021     1 (35%). Sketch the total electric field change vs. time due to a negative, uniformly charged lightning leader developing vertically toward ground from a spherically symmetrical cloud charge source. On the same sketch show the field-change components due to the developing leader channel and due to the depletion of the cloud charge source.   In producing your sketch use the following input parameters. The height H of the charge source above ground is 8 km, the line charge density is 10-3 C/m, the speed v of the leader tip is 107 m/s, and the horizontal distance D from the charge center is 7 km. How would the waveforms change if the speed were 105 m/s?         2 (35%). Show that at horizontal distances of the order of tens of meters or less the net electric field change due to a uniformly charged leader is approximately inversely proportional to distance. How should the net return-stroke electric field change vary with distance in this distance range?         3 (30%). It has been observed that at distances of 10 km and farther the lightning leader electric field waveshape depends on stroke order: 89% of first-stroke leaders exhibit monotonic positive waveforms, whereas 89% of subsequent strokes of order 8 through 18 show hook-shaped, net negative waveforms. Explain why.

After the training and development manager at Add Worth, Nicole Hayes, resigned, the CEO has made it a priority that the position be filled soon by someone of equal expertise and experience as Nicole. To locate the right candidate, Jennifer Ray, the HR manager, has been contacting recruitment firms, checking job sites, and pushing for referrals from the employees. However, she has only found candidates with little or no experience in the field who were willing to work full time for the position. At the next meeting with the CEO, Jennifer proposes an alternative strategy; she suggests hiring two experienced candidates who are open to the idea of handling the training needs on a part-time basis as a team. The CEO listens to her proposal but is not too convinced by it. Which of the following, if true, would strengthen Jennifer's proposal to use job sharing for the vacant position?

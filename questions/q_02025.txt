Ray, a friend of mine, ask me if could recommend a good lawyer to help him recover money from an embezzlement in his landscaping business. Ray had 30 two-man crews with regular routes providing full-service monthly landscaping to residential and commercial customers. He had one bookkeeper whom prepared checks to pay vendors, billed and collected cash from customers, and processed the payroll. She had worked for him faithfully for thirty years and was retiring within three months. Ray said he spent most Sundays signing all the checks. Ray brought in his daughter to replace the bookkeeper, learn the business, and hopefully take over the business some day. Much to his dismay, his daughter informed Ray that the bookkeeper had essentially doubled her own salary while processing the payroll. The bookkeeper claimed that Ray had approved the pay increases which he ferociously denied. Required: Answer the following in the text box below.

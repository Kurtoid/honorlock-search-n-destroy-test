5. Suppose we have a triangle where angle A is opposite side a, angle B is opposite side b, and angle C is opposite side c. The measure of angle B is 27deg, side a measures 28 cm, and side b measures 18 cm. a. (4 pts) There are two possible triangles that result from these measurements. Find all angle measures of both triangles. Round your answers to the nearest tenth. b. (2 pts) Suppose the measure of side b is 10 cm instead of 18 cm. Now how many triangles results from these measurements: 0, 1, or 2? How do you know?

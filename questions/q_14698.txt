Write a function named min_to_front that takes an array of integers and a length as parameters and that moves the minimum value in the array to the front by swapping its position with whatever is currently at the front of the array. For example, if a variable called list stores the following values:  [3, 8, 92, 4, 2, 17, 9] and you make the following call:  min_to_front(list, 7); The value 2 is the minimum, so the array should store the following values after the call:  [2, 8, 92, 4, 3, 17, 9] Notice that the value 3 which used to be at the front of the array is now at index 4 where the value 2 was before. If there is more than one occurrence of the minimum value, your function should move the first occurrence to the front of the array. If the minimum value is already at the front of the array or if the array is empty, then the array should be unchanged after the function executes. You may not construct any extra data structures to solve this problem (not even a string). You are allowed to construct extra int, bool, double and char variables though.
A plasmid is a circular dsDNA molecule that is present in some bacteria. Plasmid DNA can be replicated and passed on to other cells through vertical genetic transfer via [binary_fission] or horizontal transfer via [conjugation].  During the later process, the donor cell transfers the plasmid to a recipient cell. The genetic information is passed through an appendage called the [sex_pilus].

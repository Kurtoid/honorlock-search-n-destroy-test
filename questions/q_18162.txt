Use the scenario below to answer the following two questions.   The BCA assay is commonly used to determine the total protein concentration in a sample when compared to a protein reference standard. Assay samples containing protein change color from a pale green (little or no protein present) to purple (protein present) upon incubation. The purple coloration, which is directly proportional to the amount of protein present, has a maximum absorbance at 562 nm, so it can be measured on a spectrophotometer.  Your supervisor would like you to use the data provided below to plot the concentration vs. absorbance and generate a standard curve for the protein reference standard Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), to be included in the BCA assay your supervisor has asked you to perform.     BSA Conc. mg/mL Absorbance (at 562 nm)   0.0 0.0   1.0 3.3   2.5 4.9   5.0 10.2   7.5 15.1   10.0 20.3

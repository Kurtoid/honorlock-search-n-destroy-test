3.2   The article that follows concerns the use of dialysis machines in Africa.  Read the article carefully and then answer the questions that follow.   Scores of Cameroonians with kidney failure and their relatives have blocked traffic since Monday around a Yaounde hospital to protest a shortage of dialysis treatment.  Cameroon authorities blame administrative procedures and coronavirus disruptions for slowing the import of dialysis machines and medicines.   Among the kidney patients who sat or lay on the road in front of the hospital is 54-year-old Emmanuel Pierre Essi.  He says their protest began on Monday after at least seven kidney patients died within three weeks due to lack of treatment.  Essi says he and many of his peers may die after missing at least six sessions of haemodialysis for the past two weeks.  He says the Yaounde University Teaching Hospital has only five haemodialysis machines for over 160 patients.  Essi says old age and overuse have crumbled the machines and patients who need four hours of dialysis per session, now take seven hours to filter and purify their blood in the dialysis machine.  He says kidney patients also lack haemodialysis kits and dialysis fluid.  Cameroonian health officials are pleading with the patients to halt their protest while the government tries to fix the problems.  The government says that since the coronavirus pandemic began last year, it has been unable to import dialysis equipment and medicine from suppliers abroad due to travel restrictions and the economic slowdown.  Cameroonian health authorities say the country has about 2,500 patients with acute kidney infections, up from 400 in 2012.    There are about seven towns in Cameroon with dialysis centres, with five dialysis machines at each.    Yaounde has two such centres -- the largest with 20 dialysis machines.  But health authorities acknowledge they are often not working as a result of overuse and poor power supply.

You are a licensed paralegal and Kelly and Tina have met with you together to discuss their legal matter. Given the provided information, are you permitted to represent both of them and still meet your professional obligations as a paralegal? b. You have an additional concern because Kelly seems to be answering most of the questions during your meeting with Kelly and Tina about their issue with their contractor. Tina seems to be avoiding eye contact with you and when she does answer a question always looks over to Kelly first before answering.

Given the available information how should you proceed with this matter in view of your professional obligations as a paralegal?

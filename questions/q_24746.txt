Below is the titration curve for the dipeptide Ser-Gly. Answer the following questions from the graph:  Blank #1: What is the isoelectric point of Ser-Gly? Blank #2: At what pH does the -1 ion exist in approximately 100% abundance? Blank #3: Using the shorthand notation (H3A+, etc), which ionic form(s) will migrate towards the (+) end of a pH gradient gel (isoelectric focusing) when a voltage difference is applied? List all the species, with appropriate charges, separated by commas. Do not worry about superscripts or subscripts.  Blank #4: In what pH range(s) would Ser-Gly be a good buffer? Here is an example of how you should list the ranges: 0 to 1, 2 to 5, etc.  Use the numbers on the titration curve to answer the following questions: Blank #5: Which number on the graph corresponds to the pH where ionic forms with charges 0 and -1 coexist? Blank #6: Identify the point (number on the graph) at which the pH equals the pKa of the Ser side chain. (Note: typical a-COOH and a-NH2 pH values in a dipeptide are 3 and 8).

[Essay] The New Deal revolution originally emerged as an objection to the Supreme Court's efforts to limit the federal and state governments from dealing with the economic crisis caused by the Great Depression. The main criticism was directed against the conservative judicial activism that failed to present a justifiable distinction between the prioritization of economic freedoms (such as the freedom of contract) above all other constitutional rights. New Deal liberals, however, eventually developed their own 'double standard' in applying a much tougher test--of strict scrutiny--against legislation that impinges on First Amendment freedoms or equal protection, while being deferential when it comes to economic regulations. Is the New Deal double-standard any more constitutionally justifiable than the old double-standard of the Lochner era? To what extent should the Constitution be open to the selective prioritization of certain types of rights and liberties over others?

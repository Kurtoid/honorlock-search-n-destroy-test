Remember, once time runs out, it is too late to upload your Simio file without significant penalty in points.  You need to stop your test a few minutes before time runs out to insure that you have time to upload your Simio (.spfx) file. Only two pages of single-sided notes are allowed.  The only scratch paper are the two pages you have for notes.  Hand held calculators are allowed, but not your cell phone.  Do not use the Math.If( ) function. When you are finished, close Simio, then upload the Simio (.spfx) file before time runs out.  Only one upload is allowed. Problem Description Truck arrivals (make these green colored entities) occur at 6AM each day.  The daily truck contains exactly 10 parts 50% of the time and 14 parts 50% of the time.  Since the truck arrives at 6AM, make your stating time of your simulation be 6AM.   In addition to parts arriving by truck, there are individual arriving parts (make these red colored entities) that arrive according to a non-stationary Poisson process with a mean rate of 3 per hour from 6AM to noon, a mean rate of 6 per hour from noon until 6PM, and a mean rate of 2 per hour from 6PM to 6AM. All parts first go to a batch processor.  This batch processor services two parts at a time and the processing time has a Pert distribution with parameters 15, 20, 25 minutes.  Both parts in the batch must have the same color (i.e., truck arrivals are always paired with truck arrivals and individual arrivals are always paired with other individual arriving parts).  The batch processor has a queueing priority system, namely, red parts have non-preemptive priority over green parts.  For verification purposes, you should animate the batches so a visual check can be made that the batches sizes are two and both parts in the batch are the same color. After the batch processor, all parts on processed through a single-server processor that treats each part individually (i.e., the batches do not stay together as a unit after the batch processor).  The processing time at the single-server processor for each individual green entity is exponentially distributed with mean 15 minutes and for each individual red entity is exponentially distributed with mean 12 minutes.  After the single-server processor, all parts leave the system.  Travel times 5 minutes as follows:  (1) from green source to the batch processor, (2) from red source to the batch processor, (3) from the batch processor to the single-server processor, and (4) from the single-server processor to the exit of the system. All assignment statements and tallies need to be done through Processes.  In other words, do not use the "State Assignment" property or the "Tally Statistics" property on an object. Run the simulation for 50 days with only one replication (i.e., no experiment and no warmup period) and estimate the following based on the 50 days:  (1) The average total number of individual parts in the system at 7AM (note that this is one number including both green and red parts), (2) the total daily throughput of parts for the system, and (3) the average time (in minutes) that a red part the arrives between 6AM and noon spends in the system.  (Note that (3) is the TIS per part averaged only over red parts arriving to the system in the morning.)  I need to see these three values in the Results tab.  In a floor label, give the expected (i.e., theoretical) value for the daily throughput.  Note:  We have not used a queueing discipline for a batch processor before; however, I'm expecting many of you will be able to figure it out.

Which of the following best describes what a well-designed pay structure promotes?
[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).]   A vehicle is being driven on a distant planet, where the acceleration due to gravity is 7.22 m/s2.  The mass of the vehicle is 2000.0 kg.  The vehicle is driving over a hill with radius of curvature of 180.0 m.         a. Determine the force of gravity (weight) acting on the vehicle.        b. Determine the normal force acting on the vehicle by the planet's surface when the vehicle drives over the crest (top-most point) of the hill described above at 30.0 m/s.        c. Given that the mass of the planet is 4.39 x 1023 kg, use Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation to determine the radius of the planet.   Enter your answers for a, b, and c into the space below, including signs and units, as appropriate.  Show all work on a blank piece of paper or blank problem-solving template that you will scan and turn in at the end of the exam.

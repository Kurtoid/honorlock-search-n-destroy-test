Use this information to answer the following two questions.

Female cowbirds will find and monitor multiple nests of other species over a period of weeks, visiting repeatedly until the host nest is at the right stage for the cowbird to lay her eggs.  Male cowbirds do not participate in this egg-laying behavior at all.  Grackles are a close relative of the cowbird, but have a more typical mating system - the female lays her eggs in her own nest, and both the male and the female visit the nest to incubate the eggs and feed the offspring.

Diehl Incorporated owns vacant land that it plans to develop into apartment buildings.  Diehl borrowed $2 million from Wisconsin Bancorp to construct an apartment building on the land.  Diehl actually needed an additional $1 million to complete construction.  Diehl is owned by Emily.  Emily has a wealthy brother, Andrew.  Emily approached her friend, Robert, to ask for a loan to complete construction of the Diehl apartment building.  Robert was reluctant to loan Diehl the money because Wisconsin Bancorp already had a mortgage on the apartment building.  During their discussions, Robert asked Andrew if he would cover the loan to Emily if Emily did not pay.   Based on the discussions that he had with Emily and Andrew, Robert agreed to loan Diehl $1 million for construction of the apartment building.  Andrew did not sign anything as part of the loan.  Diehl experienced substantial problems during construction of the apartment building, and has now defaulted on its loans from Wisconsin Bancorp and Robert.  Diehl refuses to pay Robert back on the $1 million loan.  Robert has sued Andrew based on the argument that Andrew agreed to pay Robert if Diehl could not.  Andrew defends the claim based on the statute of frauds.   True or false, Andrew will succeed based on this defense.

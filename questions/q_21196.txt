The manufacturer of a metal wall mount for home TV sets must be sure that its product will not fail under the weight of the TV.   Since some larger sets weigh nearly 100 pounds, the company's safety inspectors have set a standard of ensuring that wall mounts can support an average of over 300 pounds.   Their inspectors regularly subject a random sample of the wall mounts to increasing weight until they fail.   They test the hypothesis  that the mean weight the wall mounts will hold is over 300 pounds, using a level of significance  = 0.01.   If the sample of wall mounts fail to pass this safety test, the inspectors will not certify the product for sale to the general public. Is this a one-tailed or two-tailed test? If the company's lawyers are worried about being sued for selling an unsafe product, should they increase or decrease the significance level?    Select all that apply.

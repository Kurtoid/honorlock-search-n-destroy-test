A protein kinase is a kinase which selectively modifies other proteins by covalently adding phosphates to them (phosphorylation) as opposed to kinases which modify lipids, carbohydrates, or other molecules. Phosphorylation usually results in a functional change of the target protein (substrate) by changing enzyme activity, cellular location, or association with other proteins. Which amino acids are known to be phosphorylated by protein kinases?

In the lecture, we spoke of tonicity. In your own words, describe what would happen if a hypertonic cell were to be placed next to an isotonic cell. Secondly, describe in your own words what would happen is a hypotonic cell was placed next to an isotonic cell.As stated in lecture, it is your responsibility to speak of "the patients cell." Lastly, Your partner starts an I.V. with a one-liter bag of normal saline which has a tonicity of .9%. Upon arrival at the receiving facility, you note the I.V. bag is empty. Your patient has a history of congestive heart failure. Your partner states, "it's no big deal; we will just swap out the bag."Explain in your own words if you support your partner's approach. I want to see a mathematical explanation supporting your response.If I do not see math, there will be no credit.

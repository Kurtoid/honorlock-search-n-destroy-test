You now drop 250 grams of pasta (at room temperature) in the boiling pot of water.  By how much will the water temperature change? Assume this process is very fast. The specific heat of water is 4.18 J/g@C, and the specific heat of pasta is 1.80 J/g@C. (Remember to write down the energy balance equation.) How much time will it take to bring the water and pasta back to boiling? (Same power of the stove and same efficiency as in #1.) If you are not confident about your answer in 2a you may assume that the final temperature of water after dropping the pasta is 90.0 @C.

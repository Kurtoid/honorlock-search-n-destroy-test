42. The following are the main steps in the generation of an action potential.   1. Sodium channels are inactivated. 2. Voltage-gated potassium channels open and potassium moves out of the cell, initiating repolarization. 3. Sodium channels regain their normal properties. 4.

Short Answer: Explain what executive function is. Give an example of a behavior you might see in early childhood (ages 3-5 years old--do not use examples from a different age, like school age children) that demonstrates that children are developing executive function.

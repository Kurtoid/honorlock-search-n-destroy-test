Melissa McCartney Thesis Committee Member   Questions for Sandy Koi written qualifier exam          What do you consider to be three measurable benefits to the human community? How will you measure, both quantitatively and qualitatively, these benefits you are interested in?  Benefit #1 Benefit #2 Benefit #3         You are interested in whether planting a small-scale garden increases parent-child interactions. How do you define a "parent-child" interaction in terms of your measurable benefits to the community?  How do you plan to measure these interactions, both quantitatively and qualitatively? Will you be collecting data from both parents and children?        The perceived value of science to a community (the general public) is difficult to measure. How are you defining "community?" How are you defining "perceived value?" How are you planning to measure, both quantitatively and qualitatively, how the community perceives the value of a natural forest community?        Expectancy-value theory has been adapted in many different fields, including education. The general idea of the theory is that there are expectations as well as values or beliefs that affect subsequent behavior.    There are four values constructs that make up Expectancy-value theory.  Intrinsic values: inherent, immediate enjoyment one gets from engaging in an activity Attainment values: importance of doing well on the task Utility values: the importance of the task for a future goal Cost values: what is lost while performing the task    Using these four values constructs, please answer the following:    How do you define the values of the students and parents in your study?     How do these values relate to the goals and purpose of your study?     How specifically are you planning to measure, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the values of the students and parents in your study?     What methods will you use to collect these data?     What will these data tell you?     How will you know if values of your participants have shifted? What if they are shifting in the opposite way that you expect?     What ideas do you have for instilling these values in your participant's long term, even if your time with them is limited?

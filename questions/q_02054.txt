Suppose a monopoly firm produces a medical device and can sell 15 items per month at a price of $2,000 each. In order to increase sales by one item per month, the monopolist lowers the price of its medical device by $100 to $1,900. The marginal revenue of the 16th item is: (Enter your answer as a numerical value without any dollar sign).

(30 points) Annual demand for number 2 pencils at the campus store is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 250. The store purchases the pencils for 6 cents each and sells them for 20 cents each. There is a two-month lead time from the initiation to the receipt of an order. The store accountant estimates that the cost in employee time for performing the necessary paperwork to initiate and receive an order is $20, and recommends a 22 percent annual interest rate for determining holding cost. The cost of a stock-out is the cost of lost profit plus an additional 20 cents per pencil, which represents the cost of loss of goodwill.    a) (25 pts) Find the simultaneous optimal values of Q and R. b) (5 pts) What is the safety stock for this item at the optimal solution?      (35 points) Suppose that one wishes to schedule vehicles from a central depot to five customer locations. The cost of making trips between each pair of locations is given in the following matrix. (Assume that the depot is location 0.)    Cost matrix cij:                                                              To     From       0   1   2   3   4   5     0       20   75   33   10   30     1           35   5   20   15     2               18   58   42     3                   40   20     4                       25         Assume that these costs correspond to distances between locations and that each vehicle is constrained to travel no more than 50 miles on each route (the 50 miles does not include the drive time to and from the depot (0)). Find the routing suggested by the savings method developed by Clarke and Wright.      (25 points) Customers arrive in a local bakery with an average time between arrivals of 5 minutes. However, there is quite a lot of variability in the customers' arrivals, as one would expect in an unscheduled system. The single bakery server requires an amount of time having the exponential distribution with a mean of 4.5 minutes to serve  customers (in the order in which they arrive). No customers leave without service. Consider this as an M/M/1 queue.   a) (10 pts) Calculate the average utilization of the bakery server. b) (5 pts) Calculate how long customers spend on average to complete their transactions at the bakery (time in queue plus service time). c)(5 pts) Calculate how long customers spend on average in the queue d)(5 pts) How many customers are in the bakery on average?

Use Chapter 3 HW Renovation file as an example. For this sample exam, you only need to complete Step 1 and upload the file to this question. Background: Lesa Martin, a member of the support/coordination staff for the conference center at Painted Paradise Golf Resort and Spa, has created a worksheet to keep track of the renovations being made to the three rooms that are used for conferences and the two technology centers that are used for computer-based presentations and interactive sessions. The technology centers are equipped with workstations, are networked, and have Internet accessibility. This spreadsheet is simple and designed only for Lesa and her associates to keep a handle on the renovation progress and estimate the increase in capacity and revenue that might occur as a result of the renovations. Lesa also wants you to analyze the banquet room sales and usage for the month of January.   Download and save the files below. Ch03HW_Renovations.xlsx    Steps to Perform: Step 1: Save the file as Ch03HW_Renovations_FirstLast.xlsx, using your first and last name. Step 2:  You have been asked to determine how long the renovation of each room will take in days. On the Renovations worksheet, in cell D6, enter a function based on the renovations started and renovations completed dates to determine the length in days of the expected renovation for the Musica Room. Copy this formula through cell D10. Step 3:  Using the Name Box, select the named range IncreaseInRevenue. You notice the named range refers to a blank cell. Therefore, you want to correct the named range. Modify the named range IncreaseInRevenue to reference cell B14 not cell B15. Step 4:  After renovations, each room will have more capacity. You want to determine the projected revenue after the renovations have been completed. In cell I6, using the named range in cell B14, enter a formula to determine the projected increase in revenue for the Musica Room based on the revenue figure in cell H6 and the increase in revenue percentage in cell B14. Copy this formula through cell I10. Step 5: Assign the named range RoomClassification to cell range A23:B26. Step 6: Based on the projected revenue in column I, you want to determine each room's projected room classification.In cell J6, using a lookup function, enter a formula to determine the projected room classification based on the projected quarterly revenue after renovations in cell I6. Use the named range RoomClassification when entering this formula. Copy this formula through cell J10. Step 7:  Lesa has asked you to analyze the sales per banquet room.On the RoomAnalysis worksheet, in cell G7, determine the total charges for the Musica Room by using a SUMIF function. Use absolute references where appropriate. Copy this formula through cell G11. Step 8: Lesa also want to know the number of times each room was used in the month of January. In cell G16, determine the total count of the Musica Room usage by using a COUNTIF function. Use absolute references where appropriate. Copy this formula through cell G20.

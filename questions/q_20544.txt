Given the following road map as shown in class. Draw a search tree up to a depth of 3 (the root node has depth 0) that illustrates the state-space search explored by A* starting from the city Mehadia. Only nodes that the algorithm chooses to expand during its search need to be illustrated. Rember, nodes that have already been explored should not be explored again.    Use the Straight-line distance in the table shown above for the estimated cost h(n) between a node n and the final destination Bucharest. Use g(n) as the true cost from the origin to node n. Remember that A* uses f(n) = h(n) + g(n) to estimate the total cost from the origin to the destination. Begin with the following root node and the immediate two child nodes:  You must label the nodes with the city (use a single letter for the city as given in the table) and the total host f(n) as I have done above. You don't need to use any drawing tool to draw the tree. Use space between two lines and labels such as M/f=241. The tree from above can be illustrated as shown below.                                                                          M/f=241                                             D/f=317                                        L/f=314

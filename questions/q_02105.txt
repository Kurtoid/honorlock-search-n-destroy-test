Date of Admission: 6/15/XX History of Present Illness:  This 71 year old patient with atrioventricular block and atrial fibrillation, for which the patient has been taking Coumadin for over a month.    Patient has had a electrocardioversion previously and was converted, but did revert back into atrial fibrillation.  Patient is not taking any medication for her complete atrioventricular block and it was felt that a pacemaker would be the best option for the patient.  Plan:  Patient will have pacemaker inserted in ASU.   Operative Report:  Date: 6/15/XX Preoperative Diagnosis: Atrioventricular Block, Atrial Fibrillation Postoperative Diagnosis:  Same Operation:  Implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker Surgeon:  A. Shah, MD Procedure:  The left infraclavicular area was prepped and draped in the usual manner and the area was infused with 1% Xylocaine.  A pacemaker pocket was formed with the incision made parallel to the left clavicle, down to the level of the prepectoral fascia.  The left subclavian vein was then easily cannulated and over a guide wire, two 7-French sheaths were passed without difficulty.  Through these sheaths, a Medtronic model lead was inserted into the right ventricle and fixed into position.  Through the other sheath, a Medtronic model lead was passed to the right atrium and fixed into position.  Once in these positions, the leads were anchored using anchoring sleeves with two 2-Ethibond sutures, then a purse string suture was placed around the leads to prevent back bleeding.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications

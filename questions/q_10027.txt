Energy conservation with nonconservative forces: A 1.37-kg block is held in place against the spring by a 74-N horizontal external force (see the figure). The external force is removed, and the block is projected with a velocity v1 = 1.2 m/s upon separation from the spring. The block descends a ramp and has a velocity  at the bottom. The track is frictionless between points A and B. The block enters a rough section at B, extending to E. The coefficient of kinetic friction over this section is 0.24. The velocity of the block is  at C. The block moves on to D, where it stops. The initial compression of the spring is closest to

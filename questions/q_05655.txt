You are doing lab work with a new species of beetle. You have isolated lines that breed true for either blue shells and long antenna, or green shells and short antenna. Crossing these lines yields F1 progeny with blue shells and long antenna. Crossing F1 progeny with beetles that have green shells and short antenna yields the following progeny:   Blue shell, long antenna                       82 Green shell, short antenna                     78 Blue shell, short antenna                      37 Green shell, long antenna                     43 Total                                                    240   A chi-square test is done to test for independent assortment.

A first-order reaction has a rate constant of 0.241/s.  If the initial concentration of A is 0.859M, what will be the concentration of A after 10.0s?   Zero-Order:                         First-Order:                         Second-Order: rate = k                                 rate = k[A]                            rate = k[A]2 [A] = -kt + [A]0                     ln[A] = -kt + ln[A]0
A. [answer1] is a non-inflammatory aseptic necrosis of the femoral head and neck. The exact cause is unknown, and it is mainly a disease of small-breed dogs.  On radiographs you will see decreased bone density in the femoral head and neck, a flattened femoral head, and osteophytes in the joint. Most animals are pain free 30 days after surgery...    B. [answer2]  causes intermittent lameness in the dog. The lameness is not associated with trauma and it may appear to shift from leg to leg. The long bones are most commonly affected.
This problem requires you to show your work and upload at the end of the test.  Solve the system of equations using GAUSS Elimination/Matrices showing all row operations. Fill in the blank: If the system is consistent/independent write your answer as (x,y,z).  If the system is consistent/dependent write your answer as an ordered triple using only variable z. If the system is inconsistent write "no solution". Show all steps!     x  +  y  +  z  =  0   x  -  y  + 4z =  -5 2x  + y + z =  5

Create a contingency table for the FatherPresent dataset. Conduct a chi-square test on this dataset. True or false: based on your chi-square staistic and associated p-value, there is an association between Father Presence and Hospital.   NOTE: You will not be using a correction in this case (so set "correct=F")
Convert each number to a number in the indicated base.  Show your work.      298 = __________FOUR     Note:  Do not type the base number because it is typed for you.  If your answer is 11645 base seven, you would type only the numbers 11645 because the base is typed for you in the problem.

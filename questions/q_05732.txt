Questions 10 and 11. A study was done to determine whether the amount of money spent on soft drinks was related to mortality from diabetes. The investigators collected data on per capita (average per person) soft drink consumption in ten US states and examined its relationship to mortality rates from diabetes in those ten states. In order to calculate per capita sales they gathered annual data on soft drink sales from commerce records and then divided these figures by the state's population from the most recent census. The mortality data were gathered from the vital records department in each state. Here are the data that they collected.     US State   Annual per Capita Soft Drink Sales   Annual Diabetes Mortality Rate (per 100,000 population)     Massachusetts   $150   207     New York   $300   353     Florida   $500   688     Alabama   $700   801     Alaska   $50   75     California   $500   605     Nevada   $200   310     Idaho   $250   325     Ohio   $400   454     Arkansas   $350   405       Based on these findings, the investigators concluded that there was an association between consumption of soft drinks and mortality from diabetes.

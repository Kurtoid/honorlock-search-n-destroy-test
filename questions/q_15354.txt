The brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis) was accidentally introduced to the Pacific Island of Guam in the late 1940's, probably as a stowaway in ship cargo. Brown treesnake populations rapidly reached unprecedented numbers, potentially because of the absence of natural predators, diseases, or other population controls. Prior to snake invasion, there were few natural predators of birds, lizards or bats other than humans. Treesnakes caused the extirpation of most of the native forest vertebrate species, including 60% of bird species (insect, grain and nectar eaters, pollinators), 50% of lizard species (mainly insect eaters), and two of the three endemic bat species (insect, fruit and nectar eaters, pollinators), the only mammals native to the island.  (A.) Inventories of native forest trees show that there has been almost no native seedling recruitment (newly germinated young trees) since the introduction of the treesnake. Suggest three hypotheses for the absence of tree recruitment, supporting each hypothesis with an ecological rationale.  (B.) Several methods of snake control have been explored, including introduction of a snake predator (such as mongoose). Describe (using words, diagrams or a combination) how you expect the abundances of the following groups to change before vs. after mongoose introduction: (1) treesnakes; (2) herbivorous insects; (3) bats; (4) native trees.

Ethylene oxide is produced from the reaction of ethylene and oxygen at 270 - 290oC and 8 - 20 atm. In order to prevent potentially dangerous pressure buildups, the container in which this reaction takes place has a safety valve set to release gas when the pressure reaches 25 atm. If a 15 m3 reaction vessel contains 7.8 x 103 moles of gas, at what temperature in centigrade (oC) will the pressure reach 25 atm? (there are 103 L per m3).

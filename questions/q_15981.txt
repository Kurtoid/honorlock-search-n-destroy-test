Problem 4 (14 pts): It is a well-known fact that chickens tend to lay fewer eggs as they get older.  A researcher collected data regarding the age of chickens (in years) and the number of eggs they laid over the course of a year.  They want to be able to predict the number of eggs chickens will lay in a year based on their age. Here are the results for 7 chickens.     Age of Chicken (in years)   2   5   6   10   8   4   3     Eggs Laid   248   219   202   150   187   220   227      (1 pts) Find the correlation coefficient between age of a chicken and eggs laid. (3 pts) Determine whether a linear relation exists between the two variables. (2 pts) Find the least squares regression line. (5 pts) Interpret the slope and y-intercept of the least squares regression line if it makes sense to. (3 pts) Predict the number of chicken eggs that should be laid in by a chicken that is 7 years old. Is this a good prediction?  Briefly explain.  Critical Values for Correlation Coefficient     n   Critical Value     3   0.997     4   0.950     5   0.878     6   0.811     7   0.754     8   0.707     9   0.666     10   0.632     11   0.602     12   0.576     13   0.553     14   0.532     15   0.514

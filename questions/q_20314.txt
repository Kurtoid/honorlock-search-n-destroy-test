Maraging steel (350 grade) has yield strength of approximately 2450 MPa (355 ksi) and a fracture toughness of 55 MPa Om (50 ksi Oin). A landing gear is to be fabricated from this material and the design stresses are 70% of the yield strength (1715 MPa, or 248.6 ksi). Assuming that the flaws must be 2.54 mm (0.1 in.) to be detectable, can the part operate safely at this stress? Assume that edge cracks are present.  The stress-intensity parameter for this crack geometry is:  Where s is applied stress and a is the crack size      (8 Marks)  What is alloy sensitization?

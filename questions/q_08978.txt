PREDATION  Question 4. Department of Natural Resource managers, biologists, and foresters in many states work together to successfully manage game populations by determining the number of deer, bear or other animals that can be harvested each year. Harvest numbers can fluctuate based on climatic factors and natural events that affect plant production. For example, squirrels have been documented to have additional litters in "masting" years. Seed masting is when plants produce seeds in synchrony (all at once and together) as a defense. Additionally, in the years following oak tree mastings, the number game animals that can be harvested tends to increase. Explain why mastings can influence deer and squirrel populations and also benefit the oak tree.

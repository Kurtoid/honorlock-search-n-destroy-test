POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Open wound left lower extremity status post fasciotomies of the leftlower extremity for compartment syndrome status post external fixator for left tibial plateau fracture. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Irrigation and debridement of the left lower extremity ofthe medial and lateral wounds, both greater than 10 cm each. ANESTHESIA TYPE: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: The patient is a 59-year-old male with the above diagnosis.

Preoperatively, thepatient's leg had too much soft tissue swelling. He did not have a positive wrinkle sign, so the soft tissueswere too swollen to proceed with definitive fixation, so the decision for maintaining the fixator and justdoing irrigation and debridement along with possible wound closure was made at that time.

He wasbrought in the operating room, placed on the operating table, given a general anesthetic. The left lowerextremity was then thoroughly prepped and draped in standard orthopedic fashion.

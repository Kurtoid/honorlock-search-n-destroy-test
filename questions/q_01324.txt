Jimmy Swaggert was a suspect in the murder of his girlfriend, and his rival's ex-spouse, Tammy Faye. The police found Tammy Faye in the basement of Swaggert's home. Her death was apparently the result of blows to the head from a blunt object. Swaggert initially told police that he knew nothing of what happened, that Tammy Faye must have been murdered by an intruder while he slept upstairs, and that he did not want to cooperate further. A few days after the murder, Swaggert called Detective Angley to get an update on the investigation. Angley invited Swaggert to come to the police station to talk things over. Swaggert went to the police station where he met with Angley in a small room with only a table and some chairs. Angley told Swaggert that he was not under arrest and gave him Miranda warnings. Swaggert then signed a Miranda waiver form and agreed to take a polygraph exam. After the polygraph was administered Angley asked some preliminary questions and then advised Swaggert that he failed the polygraph.

Angley said "you may or may not need a lawyer, I don't know. You should just tell the truth because it will set you free." Swaggert then admitted that he sometimes fought with Tammy Faye but that he did not kill her. Swaggert then stood up and left the police station. Over the next few weeks the police developed further evidence linking Swaggert to the murder of Tammy Faye and Swaggert was arrested. At Swaggert's trial he moved to suppress his statements. Swaggerts statements are:

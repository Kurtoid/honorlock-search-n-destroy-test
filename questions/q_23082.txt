Given two processors P1 and P2, the 5 stages of each processor have the following latencies:      Decode Execute Memory Writeback   P1 300 ps 400 ps 350 ps 500 ps 100 ps   P2 200 ps 150 ps 120 ps 190 ps 140 ps    Assume that when pipelining, each pipeline stage costs 20ps extra for the registers between pipeline stages.

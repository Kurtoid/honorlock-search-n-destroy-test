MAS Complete, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,uid&db=mat&AN=146838540&site=eds-live. In-text citation: ("Will Americans"). Only one in three U.S. adults received the flu vaccine in 2018, a number that has critical implications for the 2020-21 flu season, which threatens to overwhelm medical resources and lead to tens of thousands of deaths at a time when Americans still are reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic. A study led by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, and Duke University, Durham, N.C., has uncovered demographics of those groups who are less likely to receive the flu shot. These findings may inform public health efforts for future COVID-19 vaccines, and raise questions about making both flu and COVID vaccines free of charge and mandatory. In the study, published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, the researchers evaluated self-reported flu vaccination rates for 2018, which included data from the 2017-18 flu season (61,000 deaths) and 2018-19 season (34,200 deaths). The data was recorded in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an annual national survey of more than 400,000 U.S. adults, conducted by state health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "To achieve herd immunity, we would need to reach about an 80% vaccination rate, but no subgroup in our study exceeded 60%," says senior author R. Adams Dudley, of the UCSF Institute for Health Policy Studies and School of Medicine, as well as the University of Minnesota Medical School and Institute for Health Informatics. Among the findings:  Age, insurance status, and having a personal doctor were among the biggest determinants of whether a given individual had a flu Some 22.6% for those ages 18 to 24 got the flu vaccine vs. 59.3% of those over 75. Among those without insurance, 16.1% were vaccinated vs. 41.6% for those with insurance. For patients without a personal doctor, 19.4% were vaccinated vs. 43.6% for those with a personal physician. Not having a chronic condition was linked to lower Some 31.6% of those with no chronic condition were vaccinated vs. 52.7% for people with four or more chronic conditions. Variation by income group was Some 33.9% for those with a household income of less than $15,000 were vaccinated vs. 41.8% of those with an income of more than $50,000. Rates were lowest in Texas (26.4%) and highest in Washington, C. (44.2%). Other states with low rates were Louisiana (26.4%), New York (28%), Indiana (28.5%), and Tennessee (28.6%). States with high rates were West Virginia (42.6%), North Carolina (41.7%), Iowa (40.6%), and Pennsylvania (40.3%). Rates were lower among blacks and Hispanics (33.9% and 9%) than whites and Asians (41.5% and 38.3%.) Men were less likely than women to receive flu shots (36.7% 41.6%).

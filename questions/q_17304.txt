QUESTION ONE   Greg Leeds is a member of the Gadugi Nation (a federally recognized Indian tribe).  Greg was born in Oklahoma, but moved to the State of Sequoyah in 2003.   (the State of Sequoyah is a state of the United States of America, and is NOT a P.L. 280 state).    Upon moving to the State of Sequoyah, Greg took a job working as a social worker for the Sequoyah Division of Tribal Affairs (DTA), a state agency of the State of Sequoyah.  While the state agency is his employer, he is detailed to the Wesa Indian Nation (the Wesa Indian Nation is a federally recognized Indian tribe, and the tribal Reservation is within the boundaries of the State of Sequoyah). Since moving to the Wesa Indian Nation's Reservation, Greg has abandoned his tribal culture.  He does not participate in any Gadugi cultural events, nor is he involved with Wesa cultural happenings.  Greg has repeatedly told his staff that he is not sure he wants to be Indian anymore, because in his words, it "does more harm than good".  For this reason, Greg does not participate in Wesa Reservation activities, and he does not apply for any tribal programs, services, or benefits.   After leaving work, Greg was approached in the parking lot by Bill Pyle, a non-Indian drifter who is known for violence against women on the Reservation.  Before Bill could even open his mouth to threaten violence, Greg used his MMA (mixed martial arts) fighter training to take Bill down on the concrete, beating him about the face and chest.  A passerby intervened and called the police.   The United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) police pulled up to the scene just as Greg had invoked his trademark move, "The Doksi Hold".  Bill was pulled from the clutches of the hold, and the two men were separated as the BIA officers attempted to make sense of the circumstances that led to the call. The BIA officers noted in their report that the parking lot where the scuffle had occurred was on fee land within the Wesa Indian Nation's Reservation.  The State of Sequoyah operates the Sequoyah Division of Tribal Affairs (DTA), and had been granted a state right of way for the facility and the parking lot.  After much discussion about who had jurisdiction to arrest and detain, the BIA officers decided it was within their authority to preserve the peace. Bill Pyle indicated to the officers that he approached Greg to inquire where donations were to be dropped off, as Bill had toys to donate to disadvantaged children.  Greg was still unsure as to Bill's actual motives, and showed no remorse for the many injuries he caused Bill during the altercation.   Bill Pyle was treated for his injuries at the scene, and was released, taking off on-foot to head to his home off the Reservation. Based on the totality of the circumstances, the BIA officers arrested Greg and transported him to the BIA jail located on the Reservation.         Part A- (30 Points)  Discuss which sovereign(s) has jurisdiction to prosecute Greg Leeds for the crime of Assault and Battery. (assume that all involved sovereigns have criminal statutes that allow for prosecution of the crime of Assault and Battery) Be sure to fully explain your analysis and your answer.    Part B- (20 Points) Bill Pyle would like to sue Greg Leeds in a civil suit to recover medical expenses he incurred as a result of extensive physician follow-up for his injuries, as well as pay lost from time off work, and damages for "pain and suffering".  Both the State of Sequoyah and the Wesa Indian Nation Tribal Court recognize all of the probable causes of action.  The State of Sequoyah has a limit on the recoverable amount of $100,000 per cause of action, while the Wesa Indian Nation Tribal Court has a limit of $1,000,000 per cause of action.  Obviously, Bill Pyle would like to sue in tribal court.    Can the tribal court exercise civil jurisdiction in the case of Pyle v. Leeds.  Be sure to fully explain your analysis and your answer.

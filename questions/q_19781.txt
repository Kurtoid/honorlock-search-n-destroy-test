While studying a particular chemical reaction observed in a cell, a scientist notes that four substances are involved (Substance A, Substance B, Substance C, Substance D) and suspects that one is an enzyme, one a substrate, one the product of the reaction, and one an inhibitor. Under normal conditions as the reaction occurs the concentration of Substance A decreases and the concentration of Substance C increases. The scientist tests the reaction by artificially increasing the initial concentration of each substance in separate trials. The results show that when Substance A is added that Substance C has a higher final concentration than normal. When Substance B is added the reaction proceeds at a higher rate. When Substance C is added, all other substances are react like normal. When Substance D is added, the final concentration of Substance A is higher than normal and the final concentration of Substance C is lower than normal. Check all responses below that are true in this scenario.

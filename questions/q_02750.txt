Anxiety about death is lowest among those who __________.
A. My brain reeled as I read these lines. A gentleman near me said, 'It's true; I have seen the bill of sale.' 'The bill of sale!' Those words struck me like a blow. So I was sold at last! A human being sold in [a] free city...! The bill of sale is on record, and future generations will learn from it that women were articles of traffic...late in the nineteenth century of the Christian religion. It may hereafter prove a useful document to antiquaries [i.e. those who study old, rare things], who are seeking to measure the progress of civilization in the United States. I well know the value of that bit of paper; but much as I love freedom, I do not like to look upon it. I am deeply grateful to the generous friend who procured it, but I despise the miscreant who demanded payment for what never rightfully belonged to him or his.

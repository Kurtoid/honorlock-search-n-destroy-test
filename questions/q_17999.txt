A nonuniform electric field is directed along the x-axis at all points in space. This magnitude of the field varies with x, but not with respect to y or z. The axis of a cylindrical surface, 0.80 m long and 0.20 m in diameter, is aligned parallel to the x-axis, as shown in the figure. The electric fields E1 and E2, at the ends of the cylindrical surface, have magnitudes of 6000 N/C and 1000 N/C respectively, and are directed as shown in the figure. What is the net electric flux passing through the cylindrical surface?
QUESTION 1     This question is about oxygen     1.1   State the sp notation of an oxygen atom   (1)     1.2   Complete the table of oxygen below   (1)             Element   Protons   Neutrons   Electrons     oxygen                         1.3   The relative atomic mass of a sample of oxygen was found to be 16.02. The percentage composition for two of the three isotopes is given in the table. Use these data to calculate the percentage composition of the third isotope and hence its relative isotopic mass. Give your answer to an appropriate number of significant figures and ensure to show your working.     Relative isotopic mass   Percentage abundance     17.0   0.038     18.0   0.981         (4)     1.4   A mass spectrometer was used to analyse a sample of bromine, Br2, with only the 16O and 18O isotopes present. Explain why a very small peak occurs at m/z = 17.                             (2)     1.5   Write the balanced chemical equation of oxygen reacting with magnesium.

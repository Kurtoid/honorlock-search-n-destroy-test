Write a function named stutterBelowN that accepts a reference to a vector of integers and an integer n as parameters and replaces all values in the vector that are lower than n with two copies of n. For example, if the vector a stores {10, -2, 33, 55, 9, 17, 6}, the call of stutterBelowN(a, 10) should replace -2, 9 and 6, modifying a to store {10, 10, 10, 33, 55, 10, 10, 17, 10, 10}. If n is smaller than all the numbers in the vector, do not modify the vector. More examples are shown below:    original vector and function call vector contents after call   vector v1{10, -2, 33, 55, 9, 17, 6};stutterBelowN(v1, 0); {10, 0, 0, 33, 55, 9, 17, 6}   vector v1{10, -2, 33, 55, 9, 17, 6};stutterBelowN(v1, 10); {10, 10, 10, 33, 55, 10, 10, 17, 10, 10}   vector v1{10, -2, 33, 55, 9, 17, 6};stutterBelowN(v1, 50); {50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 55, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50}   vector v2{185, 2, 99, 35, 86, 247, 0, 8, 76};stutterBelowN(v2, 50); {185, 50, 50, 99, 50, 50, 86, 247, 50, 50, 50, 50, 76}   vector v3{10, 30, 20, 40, 60, 50};stutterBelowN(v3, 44); {44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 60, 50}   vector v4{11, 22};stutterBelowN(v4, 15); {15, 15, 22}   vector v5{10};stutterBelowN(v5, 1); {10}   vector v6{};stutterBelowN(v6, 10); {}

DIRECTIONS: Choose the correct answer for each question. The Stories in the Rocks [A] When he was just six years old, Jorn Hurum turned his bedroom into a small museum. His shelves became filled with a growing collection of fossils. For Hurum, these fossils were not just rocks, but things that could tell the history of life on this planet. He imagined them saying, "I am not a rock. I am a fossil. I have a story to tell." [B] Hurum earned a PhD in paleontology in his native Norway. Since then, he has been on expeditions seeking fossils all over the world. Much of his work has been carried out in Svalbard, a group of Norwegian islands north of the Arctic Circle. In the hills of this cold and remote region, Hurum and his team have found the fossils of many sea creatures. It might seem surprising to find the remains of such animals at the tops of hills, but in prehistoric times, these areas were actually seabeds about 100 meters deep.[C] Hurum has returned to Svalbard many times. The "dig season" in the region is very short - from July to August. During that time, the temperature is just about warm enough to soften the frozen ground, allowing easier access to the fossils. There is also less wind, and the "midnight sun" makes it easy for the scientists to have long, productive days.[D] Even a dream job has its challenges, however. "Sometimes, we find 'explodasaurus,'" he says. The team may find many broken bone pieces spread across a hillside. Then it becomes impossible to recreate the entire animal: "We have to identify the entire animal from individual pieces." Each of Hurum's expeditions also requires a lot of preparation. "We have between 15 and 20 people, tons of equipment - food, jackhammers, water," he explains. "There's a lot of work before you start the cool thing."[E] For Hurum, the "cool thing," is the act of discovery. In 2006, his team made its greatest discovery so far. After removing about 60 tons of rock by hand, Hurum and his team eventually dug out an enormous fossil. "We knew immediately this was something special," says Hurum. "The large pieces of bone ... told us that this was big." It was a plesiosaur - a prehistoric sea monster with teeth the size of cucumbers. The fossil was not complete, but it included a front flipper, a shoulder, and pieces of skull and neck.[F] For Hurum, the discovery of this 15-meter-long creature - nicknamed "Predator X" - was an amazing moment. "It's like one of those scratch-off lottery tickets every time you dig," he explains. "Sometimes, you start digging and you might just find part of a skull or other bone. Sometimes, you find the skull and the vertebra ... Then you know it's a jackpot!"In paragraph B, what does prehistoric mean?

Alan, a thirteen-year-old boy, was referred to Brentwood for treatment. He is aggressive with other children and teachers at his school when frustrated. He attacked his 17-year-old sister for taking the last cookie in the box when he wanted that cookie.  His mother says, "He is angry all the time. He wakes up mad at the world and goes to sleep that way. If anything goes wrong, he has a tantrum like a baby. I ran out of milk and he punched a hole in the wall." Alan's behavior at school is equally out of proportion to the stimuli.  His homeroom teacher states, "Alan comes to school mad, it seems. One morning out of the blue, he threw a chair at the window. After I calmed him down, he said there was a bird in the window outside, staring at him and it got on his nerves. I asked if the bird was saying anything to him and he said, "NO! Are you crazy? I just get so irritated at stuff."  He has exhibited these symptoms for more than a year. Using the DSM 5, you diagnose the client with what condition?

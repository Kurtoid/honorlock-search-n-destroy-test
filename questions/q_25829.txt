Create two very concise separate examples using limited partnerships that include and involve the following two events (separately):  Example 1 has a Minimum Gain Chargeback (MGC) provision getting properly triggered when meeting the applicable allocation safe-harbor rule along with the proper allocation result in that year. Real property and depreciation deduction(s) are needed in your example to explain your analysis. There can be a special allocation in place in the partnership agreement, if needed to better explain these rules. Example 2 has a Qualified Income Offset (QIO) provision getting properly triggered when meeting the applicable allocation safe-harbor rule along with the proper allocation result in that year. Real property and depreciation deduction(s) are needed in your example to explain your analysis. There can be a special allocation in place in the partnership agreement, if needed to better explain these rules.  As part of your answer, you need to go through the example you created showing an allocation will be respected involving the above items.  Label your examples "Example 1" and "Example 2," and do all analysis for the respective example directly below it. For example you can say "Example __ is Limited Partnership X, which has two partners, General Partner A and Limited Partner B. A owns ___ % of the Partnership and B owns ____% of the partnership. The items of income, loss, deduction, credit, etc. are allocated as follows according to the partnership agreement: ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________" You will also want to have partnership income and/or deductions taking place during a tax year in your example as you are showing allocation rules. And you are allowed to have a special allocation in place, if needed.  Make sure to use different names for the limited partnerships in each separate example. Also make sure to use different names (or letters) for the partner. Also, do not do both a QIO and MCG in the same example. Exam 1 should have the MCG in the example and Example 2 should have the QIO in the example. For each example only show your analysis for ONE TAX YEAR and show again the MGC and QIO being triggered properly (explaining what it is) in the respective example. Your examples should show your understanding of the partnership tax allocation rules. You need to state all requirements of the rules in order for the safe-harbors to be met. Make sure to cite all proper Code and Regulation references in terms of the proper citations. If your answer lacks the proper citations (at the level discussed in the problems covered in class) you will get points taken off. You are welcome to state your assumptions "Partnership X meets ______ requirement." You do not need to write out a full partnership agreement with respect to every point like in the problems, but you need to explain the basic items, including how the partners agree to allocate certain items, their ownership percentages, etc. The clearer you make your example Keep this as simple as possible. I want to see your understanding of the rules and application in terms of the allocation and result. You can use any example as long as it explains your understand of the rules and the application. An ideal answer should be from 600 to 750 words. Do not go over 1,000 words. Hints:  To make this as simple as possible you should make one of your examples have a certain kind of liability used to acquire a certain kind of property. The other example should not have any liabilities. Try to stay as close as possible to the problems covered in the course specifically the textbook and my problems. Again, it's best to use the most basic examples to explain your understanding. Because you have a time limit, keep your analysis as concise and clear as possible. If you recall from my summary of the tests, I kept it as concise as possible to help in explaining.  Point Allocation:  12 points: Example 1 in terms of example created and proper allocation respected under safe harbor (analysis goes in proper order). 12 points: Example 2 in terms of example created and proper allocation respected under safe harbor (analysis goes in proper order). 6 points: Proper citations showing the rules needed to explain an allocation being respected, starting with the Code and going into the Regulations.  Note: make sure to cite all Code and Regulation references in your answer used to support your analysis (these will be part of your grade). Use the following links to find Code and Regulations: Internal Revenue Code for Exam and Partnership Tax Regulations for Exam

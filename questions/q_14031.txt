A researcher is interested in the effect of police on crime. She records the size of the police force and the crime rate of 100 communities selected using a quota sampling design. After analyzing the data obtained, she concludes that the size of the police force causes a decrease in the crime rate. This illustrates a(n) _____________ approach to establishing causal relations.

Placozoan evolutionary relationships to other animals are currently unclear, and different phylogenies can be created, depending on the characters used to infer relatedness. Placozoans are multicellular invertebrates with a simple structure of only two tissue layers and only four cell types. They have the smallest amount of DNA measured in any animal. In comparison, sponges have no tissues but about 20 cell types. One species of placozoans, Tp (Trichoplax adhaerens), produces a neuropeptide almost identical to one found in cnidarians. The genome of Tp, although the smallest of any known animal, shares many features of complex eumetazoan (even human!) genomes. The next three questions refer to the phylogenetic trees that follow. In the trees, the outgroup is a taxon that is outside the group of interest; members of the group of interest are more closely related to one another than to the outgroup.      Which tree(s) has (have) been created by emphasizing the genomic features of placozoans?

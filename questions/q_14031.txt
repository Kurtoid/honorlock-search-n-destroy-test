You have a crude lysate sample (CL) containing a mixture of six proteins (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and beta-galactosidase), and your goal is to obtain purified beta-galactosidase. Some characteristics of these proteins are shown in the table below:      Protein   Concentration of ammonium sulfate (AS) required for precipitation   Molecular Weight (kDa)   Isoelectric point (pI)     1   45%   38   3.7     2   80%   22   4.8     3   65%   4   5.3     4   20%   75   6.8     5   30%   55   9.50     beta-galactosidase   45%   115   5.3       You begin your purification by performing an ammonium sulfate (AS) precipitation. You add the appropriate concentration of AS to your CL sample, incubate overnight at 4oC, then centrifuge to generate a supernatant (AS-S) and pellet (AS-P). a) What concentration of AS will you use to precipitate beta-galactosidase? _______ b) After addition of that concentration of AS and centrifugation, which protein(s) will be in the supernatant (AS-S)? ________________________   c) Which protein(s) will be in the pellet (AS-P)? __________________   One way to purify beta-galactosidase away from any contaminating proteins in the AS-P sample would be to separate the proteins based on their molecular weight. d) What type of column separates on this basis? _________________ e) Which protein (from your AS-P) would elute first from this type of column?_______ Instead, you decide to use ion exchange chromatography to further purify beta-galactosidase away from other proteins in your AS-P sample. You first run an anion exchange column equilibrated using column buffer with a pH of 5.0. f) What steps, if any, do you need to take prior to performing this chromatographic step? Explain in 1 or 2 sentences. g)  At pH 5.0, which protein(s) from the AS-P will most likely stick to the column? _________   h) State how you would elute a protein bound to an anion exchange column, and explain how this elution method works in one or two sentences.   You identify the fraction containing beta-galactosidase from your anion exchange column, and decide to run it over a cation exchange column to complete your purification.   i) Describe how you would use a cation exchange column to purify b-galactosidase away from any remaining contaminating protein(s). Be specific about: 1) the pH at which you'd equilibrate the column; 2) why you chose this pH; and 3) which protein(s) would bind and which protein(s) would flow through the column under these conditions, and why.

All the following individuals are correctly connected with their achievements during the 1920s EXCEPT:
Lawn A was planted with a single species of grass, which covers 90 percent of the lawn. The other plant species there include five species of weeds, each covering 2 percent of the lawn. Lawn B has the same six species, but with percentages of 75 percent grass and 5 percent for each of the five weeds. How do species richness and species evenness of the two lawns compare?
It is obvious that an error occurred in the preparation and/or posting of closing entries if:
Identify the form and function of all highlighted nouns* and all highlighted verbs**: oi Persai nun an erkhon ton Ellenon ei oi Athenaioi me autous epausen en to polemo.   *Identify the case, gender and, number of the highlighted noun and explain its function (e.g., direct object, indirect object, possession, dative of means, part of prepositional phrase, accusative of extent of time). **Identify the person, number, and tense of the highlighted verb and explain its function (e.g. objective infinitive, command, apodosis of a past contrary-to-fact condition) . Please make it clear which noun or verb you are identifying. You can do so by spelling out the Greek word in English letters (e.g., "ergois" for ergois or "potamo" for potamo).

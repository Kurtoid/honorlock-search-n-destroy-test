WORKOUT PROBLEM starts here: (Nothing to submit here, just read the problem. Some of the homework format/layout is already provided) Consider a volcano that has a height, H. Video from an eruption shows a piece of solid rock which leaves the volcano at point a. The rock has an initial velocity of 256 m/s with the direction shown in the figure with an angle of 55deg from the vertical. It was recorded that at point b the rock reached a maximum height of ymax = 4366 m from the ground. x-y coordinate system  and the origin are shown in the figure. Ignore air resistance. Given: A rock thrown from volcano eruption.Find:   What are the components of the initial velocity?  How long does it take for the rock to reach the maximum height?  Determine the height H. What is the horizontal distance the rock hits the ground from the origin? What is the magnitude of the final velocity just before the rock hits the ground. Determine the angle at which the rock hits the ground.   Figure:

The period that occurs for about 60% of the gait cycle is:
If F = (10 s) N, where s is in meters, and the contact surface between the block and the ground is smooth, determine the power of force F when s = 7 m. When s = 0, the 10-kg block is moving at v = 1 m/s.
A 6.0-kg object moving 5.0 m/s collides with and sticks to a 2.0-kg object. After the collision the composite object is moving 2.0 m/s in a direction opposite to the initial direction of motion of the 6.0-kg object. Determine the speed of the 2.0-kg object before the collision.
(4) (14 points) A kettle (cylindrical) pressure vessel is used to brew beer. The inner diameter of the tank is 48 inches and the wall thickness is 0.25 inches. During the beer wort boiling process, the pressure inside the tank reaches 150 psi. Assume the pressure vessel walls are under plane stress conditions. (a) Determine the principal normal stresses (

Assume that your company is working under a cost-plus-incentive contract. The contractor is reimbursed for all allowable costs, and will receive a predetermined fee based on achieving certain performance.     Meet quality standards and delivered by April, 2021, incentive fee would be $10,000   Meet quality standards and delivered by May, 2021, incentive fee would be $5,000   Meet quality standards and delivered by June, 2021, incentive fee would be $2,000    Now the project has a cost of $80,000 and is expected to be finished in June. If the PM wants an acceleration to finish the project in May, he need an extra 40 labor hours. The estimated extra costs for labor would be $50 per hour. The extra labor costs are now allowed to reimburse. What is the best value of this procurement that benefit the contractor the most?

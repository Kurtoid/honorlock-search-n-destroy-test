Use the picture, variables, and problem setup from here to answer this and the following three questions. The answer to part a is the answer to this question. The following parts are answered in questions 18, 19, and 20. Particles of charge  = +[q] mC enter a region of space with crossed electric and magnetic fields arranged as shown as a velocity selector.  In this velocity selector,  the electric field is directed down on the page and has a magnitude of  = [E] kN/C. The magnetic field in the velocity selector is directed into the page and has a magnitude of  = [B1] mT. The plates of the selector have a length

A 16-year-old female is brought to her family physician by her mother who is concerned about some weakness in her daughter's legs. The daughter explains that she has had some difficulty walking and frequently trips due to foot and leg weakness. Her past medical history has been notable for numerous ankle strains and falls. On physical examination, there is distal wasting of the lower limb muscles as well as the small muscles of the hands. The feet show pes-cavus and clawing of the toes. The extensor action of the toes and feet are weak and she demonstrates bilateral foot drop when she walks. Ankle jerks are absent and the plantar reflexes show no response. There is some loss of sensation in the feet; however, the lateral popliteal nerve is palpable. Which of the following pathogenic variants is most likely to be observed in the patient upon genetic testing?     A CGG trinucleotide expansion in the FMR1 gene   B Duplication of the PMP22 gene   C Frameshift mutation in DYS gene   D Gain of function point mutation in FGFR3   E Loss of function deletion in GJB2

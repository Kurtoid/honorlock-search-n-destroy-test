Building on the previous question, Operation Warp Speed  continues to move the vaccine in 45 lb boxes that each carry about 4,000 doses, but is exploring options with other carriers than Fedex.  A freight forwarder -- a company that purchases space in large blocks on flights from airlines and other carriers and sells that space in smaller blocks to smaller shippers -- offers the following pricing structure: $600 for any shipment weighing between 0 and 200 lbs $1000 for any shipment weighing between 200 lbs and 400 lbs. General Perna's team still wants to trade off the costs of getting the vaccine to states and counties in the Western US against the delays inherent in larger shipments. A larger shipment represents more Days of Supply, which means the vaccine waits longer to become a vaccination.  Demand for vaccines in Los Angeles County is estimated at 1.6 million doses (for the A+ portion of the population), which is about 11% of the total demand that will ship out of the facility supplying vaccine for the Western US.  The cost of a dose of vaccine is roughly $20. (Be Careful! This value may have changed from the previous question) After long deliberations and an extensive scientific study considering perishability, risk of lives lost due to delays, etc., General Perna's team concluded an appropriate inventory holding cost for COVID vaccine is 50% for the period in question. (Be Careful! This value may have changed from the previous question)  Using these values, what is the ideal shipment size, measured in boxes, for sending vaccine to Los Angeles County that minimizes the 'total cost' for Operation Warp Speed using the freight forwarder?

Part 2. The following 12 short essay questions are designed to evaluate critical thinking/reasoning skills, please make sure that you provide the most detailed answer you can.  You do not need to answer all of the questions.  What you need to do is choose 2 the following questions to answer on the attached sheets of paper (correctly number which questions you chose). If you answer more than two questions, only the first two will be graded. (5 pts. each) 1) The human population has greatly increased during the last 10,000 years, especially during the last 200 years or so.  Describe at least three reasons for this dramatic increase in the human population and how it aided in increasing the human population? 2) What are two ways that humans can control the growth rate of the human population?  What are some of the negative political and/or social consequences of the options you chose? 3) Explain how soil can be considered the interface between the geosphere, biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere?  Why is it so important to maintain/protect our soil resources (hint: think about not only what it provides, but what it takes to replace soil). 4) Briefly explain what the Theory of Plate Tectonics states about Earth's crust.  Why is important to understand this theory in regards to mineral resources, environmental hazards, and human protection?  5) Ecologist Garrett Hardin described the concept "tragedy of the commons".  What is meant by this phrase and provide an environmental example (in your own words) of a "tragedy of the commons." 6) Briefly explain the governmental policy of land zoning.  How can proper zoning reduce urban blight and slow the urban sprawl? 7) Describe the differences between no-till farming and conventional farming.  Even though there are some environmental advantages to no-till farming, what is one major issue/challenge that no-till farmers face? (Hint: think about what needs to increase in order to maintain a healthy crop). 8) Describe what aquaculture is, why it is important to maintain natural fisheries, and what some of the environmental challenges associated with aquaculture are. 9) Describe in detail the Hubbert Curve for peak oil production.  Discuss what the curve represents, in regards to, what will occur when we reach peak oil and the lower and upper estimates of petroleum reserves. 10) The three fossil fuels have a number of environmental hazards associated with them that are not associated with nuclear power.  List two environmental hazards associated with the fossil fuels (and not with nuclear power) and then discuss why nuclear power (e.g., fission) has not grown in popularity and some of the challenges that are unique to nuclear power generation. 11) Discuss at least two distinct environmentally sound ways that humans can maximize our energy resources, specifically how each of the options you chose can reduce our energy demand, what fossil fuel we would need less, and what renewable energy source would potentially provide that energy demand in the future. 12) Discuss why the argument can be made that no one single renewable energy source will solve our future energy demands.  Provide at least two real-world examples to support your response.

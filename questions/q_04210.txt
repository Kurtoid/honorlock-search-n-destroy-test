S6 Marketing Mix Analysis In the S6 Marketing Mix Table (line 195), the sales promotion people say that their last short- term promotion campaign led to new trial and permanent switching of buyers of competitive products to our brand and that the enduring effect in years 2-5 should be assumed to be 20% of the first year cash Flow/Profits. What is the new IRR under this assumption?

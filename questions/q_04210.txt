BRON A: As gevolg van die toenemende teenwoordigheid van Islam in Noord-Afrika, het baie mense in Afrika begin bekeer tot Islam. Hulle het dit om verskeie redes gedoen. Vroee sendelinge, soos Abdallah ibn Yasin, het duisende Berbers (etniese groepe) beinvloed om Islam te aanvaar. Baie Sahara-Afrikaners het hulle tot Islam bekeer om hulself te beskerm teen slawerny, wat destyds 'n bloeiende handel was. Sommige leiers het hulle tot Islam bekeer om politieke steun van die Arabiere te verkry en om kommersiele verhoudings te vergemaklik. Nie alle Noord-Afrikaners, soos die plaaslike Berber sprekende bevolking, het egter outomaties die Islam aanvaar nie. In werklikheid het Islam eers in die 12de eeu GJ die vernaamste godsdiens in Noord-Afrika geword. Bron: Module GR 7

Fill in the blank: Fill in the blanks in the paragraph below that describes the light reactions stage of photosynthesis. Please read the description of the processes, and chose from one of the terms in the provided word bank (you will not use all of the terms and it is possible for a term to be used more than once).Word bank: Water, PQ, Carbon Dioxide, Oxygen, NADPH, NADP+, ADP, ATP, Chlorophyll, Chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, Cytochrome complex, Reaction Center, Water, Primary electron acceptor, antenna pigments, Photons, Photosystem I, Photosystem II, Hydrogen Ions, ATP synthase, blue, orange, yellow, purple.   In the light reactions of photosynthesis, particles of visible light strike the pigment molecule [1._______________]. The primary pigment molecule used for the light reactions is [2.____________]; which specializes in absorbing energy from the high-energy color [3.___________].  The first type of pigment molecules that absorb energy from sunlight are called [4.______________] and are associated with the protein complex called [5.________________]. From there, the energy is diverted to the [6.__________________] molecule. There, it energizes an electron which is passed along to the [7.________________]. Electrons are replenished by breaking apart [8.____________] molecules. This process also releases  [9._____________], which begin to accumulate within the membrane.  Next, the energized electron is transferred to the [10._____]; which then passes it through the [11._________________], which makes up the majority of the electron transport chain. The energy from this excited electron is siphoned off and utilized in active transport. This process brings in many more [12._______________] that continue to accumulate within the membrane. From there, the de-energized electron is passed to the next protein complex called [13.__________________]. In this system, the electron is re-energized and transferred to the molecule  [14._______________] in order to create [15._________________]. Finally, the particles that were accumulated within the membrane in great number are used to create the high energy molecule [16._____________]. This molecule is made from [17.___________]. It is created by passing [18.____________] through the enzyme [19.___________________].

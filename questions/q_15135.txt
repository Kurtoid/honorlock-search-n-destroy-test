On October 31, 2017, you observed that the term structure of the interest rates was flat at the semiannually compounded rate of 4%. You wanted to invest in 1-year zero-coupon Treasury bond. (a) Suppose that you purchased 1-year zero-coupon bond at the market price of $96.12 on October 31, 2017. On November 30, 2017 (30-days later), you find that the term structure of the interest rates shifts down to 3% per annum (semi-annually compounded, flat term structure). What would be the 30-day holding period return (HPR)? [answer1] (b) Suppose that you purchased 1-year zero-coupon Treasury bond at the market price of $96.12 on October 31, 2017. At the same time, you entered into a 30-day Repo with a Repo dealer. More specifically, you delivered the 1-year bond to the Repo dealer and received $86.12 in exchange on October 31, 2017. You also agreed to repurchase the bond at the price of $86.12 plus interests at the maturity day of the repo (November 30, 2017). The quoted repo rate from the dealer was 6% per annum. On November 30, 2017 (30-days later), you find that the term structure of the interest rates shifts down to 3% per annum (semi-annually compounded, flat term structure). What would be the 30-day holding period return (HPR)? [answer2] (c) Suppose instead that the term structure of the interest rates shifts up to 5% (flat) on November 30, 2017. Without doing any calculation, do you think the 30-day holding period return (HPR) in part (a) would be larger (or less negative) than the 30-day holding period return (HPR) in part (b)?  [answer3]

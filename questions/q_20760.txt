A 30-year-old male was brought to the emergency department by a fire department ambulance that was called by police to a building where suspected drug sales and use were occurring.  The patient was found minimally unresponsive on the floor in the apartment where other individuals were arrested for solicitation and illegal possession of narcotics, including cocaine and heroin.  The patient was later identified by his sister, who stated that he is a chronic heroin addict. Upon arrival to the E.D., the patient was found to be combative and in acute respiratory failure.  He required immediate intubation and was placed on continuous mechanical ventilation and admitted to ICU.  The drug toxicology screening test later returned the finding of a high level of heroin that coincided with the patient's heroin dependence with intoxication and delirium on admission.

I understand that once I begin the exam, I CANNOT have notes, a textbook, cell phone, tablet, second computer, etc. in my work area. I MUST show my desk AND do a 360-degree room scan with the camera on my computer to prove that I do not have a secondary device on my desk.  If you have not already done so, show the camera your desk area AND do a 360-degree room scan. Note: if you do not do a 360-degree scan, you WILL be penalized. Anything less than 360 degrees leaves the possibility that you have another device sitting in the area you did not show and I HAVE seen students attempt to get away with this. ALSO SHOW YOUR ENTIRE DESK AREA TO THE CAMERA TO PROVE THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING IN YOUR WORK SPACE. Violation of any of the above will result in a minimum 20 point penalty, up to forfeiture of ALL points earned.

Anna and Vanessa are twins who are celebrating their 45th birthdays today (t = 0).  Both sisters currently have nothing saved for their retirements. Anna realizes that she needs to begin saving for retirement.  Anna's plan is to deposit into an investment account $25,000 annually at the end of each of the next 20 years.  The first deposit will occur one year from now when she turns 46 (t = 1), and the final deposit will be made on her 65th birthday (t = 20).  On the other hand, Vanessa is a procrastinator and doesn't plan on beginning saving for retirement until five years later when she turns 51.  She will also make her last deposit on her 65th birthday, so she will have made only 15 annual deposits.  Both Anna and Vanessa plan to retire when they make their final deposit on their 65th birthdays.  Both have similar investing styles so they both expect to earn an annual 10% rate of return on their investments.  How much does Vanessa need to save annually to have the same amount at retirement that Anna has?

Q4a. (30 points). Supplementary cementitious materials (SCM's) are routinely used to replace cement in concrete. That being the case, describe the physical (e.g. particle size, texture) and chemical (e.g. oxides, reactivity, solubility....) properties of fly ash, slag cement, and silica fume relative to a typical ASTM C150 Type I portland cement and how these properties could be expected to affect properties of a concrete mix.   Q4b. (30 points). Benchmark (or compare/contrast) portland-limestone cement (PLC) as specified by ASTM C 595 Type IL to portland cement as specified by ASTM C 150 Type I. In this exercise, consider a range of factors such as manufacturing, environmental impact, fresh concrete properties, setting tendencies, and hardened mechanical and durability properties and explain how the properties of each cement impact these factors.
For complex or irregularly shaped objects, ____________________ may be added to the bill of materials to fully describe certain parts.
One reason ionic compounds do not dissolve well in nonpolar solvents is that  ion-dipole interactions are too large for effective solvation to occur. ion-solvent interactions are not strong enough to solvate the ions in solution. not all cations and anions have the same magnitude of charge and therefore do not form neutral ion pairs. there are no forces of attraction between ions and nonpolar molecules.

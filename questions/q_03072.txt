Image: Graph of temp versus energy. A line slopes up from the X axis and is labelled A and Solid. Then there a plateau labelled with B. Then there is a line that slopes up labelled with C and liquid. Then there is a plateau labelled with D. Then there is a line sloping up that is labelled with E and gas. End of image. Calculate the total energy required (in Joules) to bring {x} g of  compound "X" (MW ={w} g/mol) from {z} degrees C to {t} degrees C. Data :  melting point of X = {m} degrees C boiling point of X = {b}  degrees C c(s) (heat capacity solid X) = {s} J/g/ degrees C;  c(l) (heat capacity liquid X) = {l} J/g/ degrees C; c(g) (heat capacity gas X) = {g} J/g/ degrees C; DHfus (molar heat of fusion for X) = {f} kJ/mol DHvap (molar heat of vaporization for X) = {v} kJ/mol

A patient sustains burns to their entire R. UE, anterior chest, anterior stomach, and anterior R. LE. Which of the following is MOST accurate regarding the percentage of their body affected?
People with Type I Diabetes cannot release sufficient insulin to trigger glucose uptake into several types of tissues. As a result, after a meal, glucose levels increase to abnormally high levels, and individuals have                 and must use triacylglycerols as their principal fuel.  In the liver, acetyl-CoA is converted to ketone bodies, which are exported and transported to other tissues to be used as fuel. If left untreated, ketone bodies build up in the blood leading to a dangerous                 in pH levels. This sequence of events can be reversed by injecting                .

Below is a summary of a nursing study. Read the summary and then answer the factual questions that follow. Select all that apply when appropriate to do so.  Montanari was interested in studying the notes made by various members of the health care team on patients' hospital charts in terms of their communication potential and utility to various hospital personnel. She began her project with some general questions, such as: Are the nurses' entries on the patient chart used by other staff? Who is most likely to read nurses' entries on the patient chart? Do particular types of entries encourage utilization? Montanari proceeded to reflect on her own experiences and observations relative to these issues and reviewed the literature to find whether other researchers had studied these problems. Based on her review and reflections, Montanari developed the following hypotheses: #1. Physicians refer to nursing notes on the patients' charts less frequently than do other personnel. #2. The amount of experience of the nurses making the notes is related to the frequency with which hospital staff refer to nursing notes    #3. Nursing notes are more likely to be referred to by hospital staff if the patient has been hospitalized for more than 5 days than if the patient has been hospitalized for 5 days or fewer.

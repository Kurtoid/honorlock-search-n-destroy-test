I understand that once I begin the quiz, I CANNOT have a cell phone, tablet, second computer, notes, books  etc. in my work area. On your desk, you may ONLY have your calculator, a pen/pencil and ONE piece of BLANK scratch paper. I may NOT have an ENTIRE NOTEBOOK on my desk. I MUST show my desk AND do a 360-degree room scan with the camera on my computer to prove that I do not have any prohibited items on my desk. I MUST also pick up my ONE piece of blank scratch paper and show BOTH sides of it to the camera. If you have not already done so, show the camera your desk area AND do a 360-degree room scan. Also, pick up the ONE piece of blank scratch paper and show both sides of it to the camera. Note: if you do not do a 360-degree scan, you WILL be penalized. Anything less than 360 degrees leaves the possibility that you have another device sitting in the area you did not show and I HAVE seen students attempt to get away with this.  Violation of any of the above will result in a minimum 20 point penalty, up to forfeiture of ALL points earned.
Oxford Corporation has 120,000 shares of preferred stock outstanding, 4% cumulative, 100 par value. It also has 1,400,000 shares of common stock outstanding, 0.01 par value. Oxford did not pay a dividend in 2017. In 2018, if Oxford's board of directors declares a total dividend of 1,650,000 to be distributed to preferred and common stockholders, how much will be paid to the common stockholders?
The production of acetanilide(C8H9NO) involves the treatment of aniline(C6H7N) with acetic anhydride(C4H6O3).  This reaction produces an amide called acetanilide(C8H9NO) and the byproduct acetic acid (C2H4O2).  The reaction is as follows: aniline        +         acetic anhydride         --------->      acetanilide             +          acetic acid C6H7N                          C4H6O3                                      C8H9NO                               C2H4O2 molar mass C6H7N = 93.13g/mol             molar mass C4H6O3 = 102.09g/mol molar mass C8H9NO = 135.16g/mol        molar mass  C2H4O2 = 60.05g/mol Since aniline(C6H7N) is a liquid, conversion from milliliters to grams will yield the equivalence of 4.000 grams of aniline(C6H7N).  The mass of aniline(C6H7N) used in the reaction equals to 4.000g. The reaction goes 100% to completion and aniline(C6H7N) is the limiting reagent. If after performing this synthesis the actual mass of acetanilide(C8H9NO) is 4.420 grams, calculate the percent yield.  Select the best choice. (*hint: reaction balanced?)

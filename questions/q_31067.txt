100 mL of a solution with a TOC (total organic carbon) concentration of 500 mg/L is placed in each of the five containers with activated carbon and shaken for 48 hours. The samples are filtered and the concentration of TOC measured, yielding the following analyses:   Test beaker no.:          1          2           3            4             5 Carbon (grams):        10        8           6            4             2 TOC (mg/L):               42        53         85        129      267   The Freundlich isotherm is to be used:  X/M = k Cf 1/n The value of X/M in the 3rd beaker is (mg/g):

A building may fail by excessive settlement of the foundation or by collapse of the superstructure. Over the life of the building, the probability of excessive settlement of the foundation is estimated to be 0.1, whereas the probability of collapse of the superstructure is 0.05. Also, if there is excessive settlement of the foundation, the probability of superstructure collapse is 0.2. Compute: a) The probability that both failure modes will occur over the life of the building. b) The probability that the building will fail during its lifetime, i.e., at least one mode of failure will occur. c) The probability that only one of the two failure modes will occur over the life of the building.

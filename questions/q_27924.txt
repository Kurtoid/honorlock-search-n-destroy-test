Problem 4 Pnina is the owner of "Happy Trucks," a toy manufacturing company that specializes in the production of toy fire trucks. Each custom truck is produced in three steps. The first step is tooling, during which the truck's main body and wheels are put together. The second step is painting, during which the truck is painted according to the customer's preferred colors. The third step is a safety inspection, during which the finished truck is inspected for compliance with safety laws and regulations. Although the time taken to complete each of the above three steps is to some extent predictable, Pnina has observed significant variation based on historical data. In particular, based on this data, Pnina estimates that:  The time taken to complete the tooling step is approximately Normal with a mean 14min and a standard deviation of 3min. The time taken to complete the painting step is approximately Triangular with lowest, most likely and highest values of 10, 15 and 20min, respectively. The time taken to complete the inspection time is approximately Uniform with lowest and highest values of 3 and 8min, respectively.  (You may assume that any time spent between steps is already included in the above estimates.) Although the materials and processing cost of producing a single truck is fixed at $20, Pnina is worried about delays in the production process. Specifically, she estimates that whenever the production of a truck takes longer than 30min, her business incurs an extra cost (i.e., a "penalty") of approximately $1.50 per minute, owing to her inability to commit to a higher total daily production. Before making any changes to her business model, she decides to run a simulation to get a better understanding of her current production costs, including penalties for production delays. To do so, she uses the following template to calculate the total cost associated with the production of a single truck.

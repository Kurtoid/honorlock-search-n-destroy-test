A population of 74 wild turkeys lives on an island in Michigan. In this population, 50% have clean shanks (ff; no leg feathers) and 50% have feathery shanks (FF or Ff; leg feathers). 5 birds with clean shanks fly in from a neighboring population, and reproduce with the turkeys already there. This causes the frequency of birds with clean shanks to increase by 10%, even though leg feathers have no effect on survival or reproduction. A. Based on the above description, _________________________ [v1] has led to a change in the turkey population. B. Compared with the original population, the frequency of birds with clean shanks has increased. Has the turkey population evolved, and if so, why? [v2]

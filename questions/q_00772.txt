A large population of laboratory animals has been allowed to breed randomly for a number of generations. After several generations, 49 percent of the animals display a recessive trait (bb), the same percentage as at the beginning of the breeding program. The rest of the animals show the dominant phenotype, with heterozygotes indistinguishable from the homozygous dominants. What is the frequency of allele b in the gene pool?

The network uses the distance-vector algorithm to calculate the least cost path from one node to another. Node x is connected with direct links to nodes y and z. The costs for x to its neighbors are c(x,y) = 5, c(x,z) = 8. y sends the following distance vector to x: { Dy(x) = 4, Dy(y) = 0, Dy(z) = 2 } y sends the following distance vector to x: { Dz(x) = 3, Dz(y) = 6, Dz(z) = 0 } Write the Bellman-Ford equations for calculating the new distance for Dx(z). Fill in the appropriate numbers into the equation and calculate the new distance from x to z.

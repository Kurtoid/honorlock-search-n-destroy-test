Physical exam reveals bilateral bruising of the mastoid processes, pupils that are sluggishly-reactive at approximately 7 mm, JVD, absent breath sounds on the left accompanied by bruising and crepitus to the left chest, pelvic instability, and the deformed left upper leg. Numerous bruises and abrasions are on his head and left side of his body. Vital signs are BP 240/116, P 70, and R 6 and snoring.

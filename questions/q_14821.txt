Bacterial cells grow and divide through a process known as [DIVISION]. If incubated for sufficiently long enough bacterial growth goes through 4 distinct growth stages.  Assuming that there is an abundance of nutrients, bacterial cells will grow fastest during the [STAGE1] phase of growth.  The number of bacterial cells can be accurately determined at any of these stages by [METHOD]. However, an assessment level of purity in the culture can be gained from [METHOD2].

The neighbor said that the only medication the woman was using was for blood pressure and sometimes an aspirin. Blood and urine samples were collected. Arterial blood gas results were:  pH 7.2;  PCO2 47 mm Hg;  HCO3 8 mmol/L.  Blood glucose was 340 mg/dL and a high anion gap was calculated. Urine glucose and ketones were markedly increased. Based on the laboratory values, what state of acid-base balance is this patient in?

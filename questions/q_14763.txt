Grub My platter arrives, the waitress urging, "Eat up, hon," before she hustles away. The omelet has been made with processed cheese, anemic and slithery. 5 The toast is of white bread that clots on my tongue. The strawberry jelly is the color and consistency of gum erasers. My mother reared me to eat whatever was put in front of me, and so I eat. I 10 look around. At six-thirty this Saturday morning, every seat is occupied. Why are we all here? Why are we wolfing down this dull, this dangerous, this terrible grub? 15 So why are we here in these swaybacked booths eating poorly cooked food that is bad for us? The answer, I suspect, would help to explain why so many of us are so much bigger than we ought to be. I sniff, 20 and the aroma of grease and peppery sausage, frying eggs and boiling coffee jerks me back into the kitchen of my grandparents' farm. I see my grandmother, barefoot and bulky, mixing 25 biscuit dough with her blunt fingers. Then I realize that everything Ladyman's serves she would have served. This is farm food, loaded with enough sugar and fat to power a body through a slogging 30 day of work, food you could fix out of your own garden and chicken coop and pigpen, food prepared without spices or sauces, cooked the quickest way, as a woman with chores to do and a passel of 35 mouths to feed would cook it. "Hot up that coffee, hon?" the waitress asks. "Please, ma'am," I say, as though answering my grandmother. My father 40 stopped at places like Ladyman's because there he could eat the vittles he knew from childhood, no-nonsense grub he never got at home from his wife, a city woman who had studied nutrition, and 45 who had learned her cuisine from a Bostonian mother and a Middle Eastern father. I stop at places like Ladyman's because I am the grandson of farmers, the son of a farm boy. If I went from 50 booth to booth, interviewing the customers, most likely I would find hay and hogs in each person's background, maybe one generation back, maybe two. My sophisticated friends would not eat 55 here for love or money. They will eat peasant food only if it comes from other countries--hummus and pita, fried rice and prawns, liver pate, tortellini, tortillas, tortes. Never black-eyed peas, never 60 grits, never short ribs or hush puppies or shoofly pie. This is farm food, and we who sit here and shovel it down are bound to farming by memory or imagination. 65 With the seasoning of memory, the slithery eggs and gummy toast and rubbery jam taste better. I lick my platter clean. Adapted from "Grub" by Scott Russell Sanders, from Wigwag, June, 1990.   Which statement best explains how the author's memory of his grandmother contributes to the passage?

6) According to Moran although one can fail to have immediate knowledge of what one believes, intends, desires, loves and so on, failure here is not merely epistemic, that is, is not merely a matter of one's being mistaken or ignorant.  What sort of failure is it, according to Moran?  Explain.  (Here is a continuation/elaboration of this question: If I am not perceptually acquainted with an object, I may not have immediate knowledge of its properties.  But what I lack here can be remedied by my learning from another, who has such perceptual acquaintance with the object, what the objects properties are.  But in the case of my own mental states lack of immediate knowledge can't be remedied in this way.  Why, according to Moran, not?  Why would knowing one's psychological states on the basis of observation of one's behavior or on the basis of testimony not provide one with what one lacks?)

2. Imagine Serena explains her perspective about morality and incest to a friend. She says: "People typically have an unfavorable moral attitude about incest. But that doesn't mean we have to think incest is immoral. If we treated incest as if there's nothing morally wrong with it, that's just as valid as thinking it's morally wrong. Here's an analogy. People typically have an unfavorable attitude about punk rock music since it's abrasive and extreme sounding. But if we treated punk rock as if it's beautiful music, that's just as valid as treating it as obnoxious music. The morality of incest is just like that. So, we shouldn't necessarily judge someone just because they engaged in incest." If this is Serena's perspective, which of the following is *false* ? A. Serena's perspective implies that we cannot be in error when we believe an action is moral or immoral.  B. Serena's perspective supports the idea that an action can be both moral and immoral if the action was approved of by one culture and disapproved of by another.  C. Serena's perspective implies that social reformers should be strongly supported. D. Serena's perspective supports the idea that there aren't facts about whether an action is moral or immoral.

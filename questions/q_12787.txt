Read the following passage and the information about its source. Then decide which paraphrase of the passage conveys the important information while avoiding plagiarism. Original source:Thomas Jefferson had made it unmistakably clear to Lewis and Clark that their foremost objective was to find "the direct water communication from sea to sea formed by the bed of the Missouri & perhaps the Oregon." But in his detailed letter of instructions to Lewis, Jefferson devoted more words to the Indian nations than to any other topic. Not only was Jefferson intensely curious about the tribes, he wanted Lewis and Clark to wean their loyalties away from the despised British traders and enfold them into the orbit of American trade and commerce.From:Jones, Landon Y. William Clark and the Shaping of the West. Hill and Wang, 2004. The passage appears on pages 130-31.

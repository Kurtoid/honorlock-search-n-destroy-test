DecideYourPlan is a new startup company for cell phone plans. The company lets you decide your own guaranteed minimum time per month and offers $0.14 per minute of your guaranteed minimum time and $0.45 per minute if your usage exceeds the guaranteed minimum time. For example, if you pick 500 minutes per month as your guaranteed minimum time, then you pay $500*0.14 = $70 fixed monthly fee and $0.45 per minute over 500 minutes. The actual usage (in minutes) per month is distributed following the table below:     actual usage (minutes) probability cdf   360 7/25 7/25   370 4/25 11/25   400 2/25 13/25   440 1/25 14/25   470 5/25 19/25   480 3/25 22/25   500 3/25 25/25                      Suppose that you pick 440 minutes as your guaranteed minimum time.  (a) If the actual usage for a month is 360 minutes, what is the cost for the month in dollars? Show work on your scratch paper.  [a] (b) If the actual usage for a month is 500 minutes, what is the cost for the month in dollars? Show work on your scratch paper.  [b] (c) What is the probability that your usage exceeds the guaranteed minimum time? [d] (d) Paid minutes are defined as the minutes worth the money you paid for the month. For example, if the actual usage for a month is 360 minutes, then your paid minutes for the month are your guaranteed minimum time. If the actual usage for a month is 500 minutes, then your paid minutes are 500 minutes. What is the expected amount of paid minutes? Show work on your scratch paper.  [e]  (e) Overtime is defined as used minutes exceeding the guaranteed minimum time. For example, if actual usage is 480 minutes, then overtime is 40 minutes. What is the expected amount of overtime in minutes? Show work on your scratch paper.  [f]  (f) What is the expected amount of unused minutes from the guaranteed minimum time? Show work on your scratch paper.  [g]  (g) Suppose that the newsvendor ratio is 0.9 (which is not necessarily a correct number for this problem but let's pretend that it is a correct newsvendor ratio). What is the optimal guaranteed minimum time you should choose to minimize the expected monthly cost? [h]

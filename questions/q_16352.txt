The production of acetanilide(C8H9NO) involves the treatment of aniline(C6H7N) with acetic anhydride(C4H6O3).  This reaction produces an amide called acetanilide(C8H9NO) and the byproduct acetic acid (C2H4O2).  The reaction is as follows: aniline           +           acetic anhydride         --------->      acetanilide             +          acetic acid C6H7N                           C4H6O3                                         C8H9NO                               C2H4O2 molar mass C6H7N = 93.13 g/mol             molar mass C4H6O3 = 102.09 g/mol molar mass C8H9NO = 135.16 g/mol        molar mass C2H4O2 = 60.05 g/mol Since aniline is a liquid, conversion from milliliters to grams will yield the equivalence of 4.000 grams of aniline(C6H7N).  The mass of aniline(C6H7N) used in the reaction equals to 4.000 grams. The reaction goes 100% to completion and aniline(C6H7N) is the limiting reagent. If after performing this synthesis the actual mass of acetanilide(C8H9NO) is 4.420 grams, calculate the percent yield.  Select the best choice. (*hint: reaction balanced?)

The infamous 'shock generator' obedience studies conducted by Stanley Milgram in which subjects became emotionally engaged as they were lead to believe they were administering potentially lethal levels of shock to another subject is an example of a study that would be considered high in _______________, but low in _______________.
Based on what we have learned in class, A. Type the Compete Ground State configuration for the atom 41Nb. Type your answer for A in the provided blank.  Simply leave one space between each sublevel; no need for commas or parentheses - you can use the x2 button to make superscripts or leave them as normal font. For example 1s2 2s1 or 1s2 2s1  B. Draw on your written paper the labeled Condensed Orbital Diagram (arrows!) for the atom Nb. Condensed - Use the noble gas abbreviation. This will be graded manually on your written work.

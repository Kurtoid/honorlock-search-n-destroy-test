5 pages double spaced (1500 words) A slip and fall incident occurred inside a store when a customer slipped on a wet floor at 10:00 a.m.   Assume that liability for the slip and fall is not an issue.  The customer suffered a broken hip. The store did not have a General Liability policy in place at the time of the fall.  Realizing that the customer suffered a significant injury and that the claim could be costly,  the owner of the store called an insurance agent and applied for  a General Liability Insurance policy in the early afternoon on that day.  The application had the following question: Are you or any owner, principal or manager aware of any pending claims or incidents that may give rise to a claim or lawsuit?  The owner check off "no" to this question and further signed off on the application which provided that:   "I affirm that all information contained on this application is true, accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge".  The application  had a provision that incorporated it into the policy of insurance.    A policy of insurance was issued based upon the representations in the application and a declarations page was issued that stated that the policy  went into effect at 12:01 a.m. on the day of the fall.  The claim was reported two days later after the injured customer hired an attorney and the store received a letter of representation from the attorney.   What  is your recommendation as to how the  insurance company should handle this matter?  Should the claim be covered?  What if the store argues that it did not know there was a pending claim until the injured customer hired an attorney and a claim formally presented?   Should a reservation of rights letter be sent to the store? What about the potential denial of the claim?  Are there grounds to cancel the policy?  Is there a basis for the policy to be deemed void ab initio?

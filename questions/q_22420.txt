TEXT A             UMKHUBA OYINGOZI WABESIFAZANE         1   Kukhuzwa umkhuba oyingozi wabesifazane wokuzishisa isikhumba ngokhilimu namakhemikhali okukhanyisa isikhumba. Lo mkhuba obuwande kosaziwayo bodwa kuthiwa usungenele nakwabesifazane abajwayelekile abangeneme ngebala labo elimnyama. Ukuxazulula le nkinga ungoti wezokuzicwala uNkk. Futhi Mkhize unomkhankaso obizwa ngokuthi Ngimnyama Ngimuhle Anti Bleaching Campaign, ozoqala ngoNovemba eBotanic Gardens eThekwini. UNkk. Mkhize onesikole sokuzicwala, Ubuhle Beauty Academy, uthi abesifazane kabanelisekile ngebala labo elimnyama, bafuna ukuba mhlophe njengabelungu.         2   Abantu besifazane abaningi batholakala sebenenkinga yesikhumba ngenxa yokuthi basebenzisa okhilimu bokukhanyisa isikhumba abatholakala ngisho emgwaqeni. Okhilimu nemijovo yokukhanyisa isikhumba banekhemikhali eyingozi i-quinine, uhulumeni athola uthole ukuthi ayikulungele ukusetshenziswa ngabantu, wase eyikhipha yonke imikhiqizo enayo. Ngebhadi le mikhiqizo ibuyile futhi nabantu bayayithenga,         3   Uma abantu besebenzisa okhilimu bokukhanyisa isikhumba baba nenkinga uma sekumele babayeke, basala benamashubaba, abanye bayavuvukala uma beke bashiswa yilanga. Abanye bagcina sebenesikhumba esibonakala imithambo eluhlaza engaphansi ngoba sekuvela isikhumba esingaphansi okungamele sivele. Uma sekwenzeka lokho umuntu usheshe alizwele ilanga, abe nezinduna uma isikhumba singcoliswa okuthile. Okusabisa kakhulu ukuthi ukusebenzisa le mikhiqizo ekhanyisa isikhumba kwenza umuntu abe namathuba amaningi okuba nomdlavuza (ikhensa) yesikhumba.         4   UMasipaIa weTheku uxhase Io mkhankaso ngendawo yokwenza umcimbi okungenwa kuwo mahhala. Inhloso ukwexwayisa abantu besifazane nabesilisa ngobungozi bokukhanyisa isikhumba. Nakuba Io mkhuba wande kakhulu kwabesifazane, bakhona nabesilisa abawukhonzile Io mkhuba. Asibambe iqhaza sonke, sisho ngazwi linye sithi; Phansi ngokushiswa kwesikhumba! [ucashunwe kudrum magazine]   RIGHT CLICK ON THE BUTTON BELOW TO OPEN TEXT A IN A NEW TAB

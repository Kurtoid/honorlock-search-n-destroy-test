However, there are other methods of obtaining such information, so the issue of efficiency of access needs to be investigated. The results (in minutes) from an experiment in which 10 computer-proficient medical professionals were timed both while retrieving an image from a library of slides and while retrieving the same image from a computer database with a Web front end are listed below.           T1   T2   T3   T4   T5   T6   T7   T8   T9   T10  T-bar  s2     Slide   30   25   40   25   20   30   35   62   40   51   35.8   12.93     Digital   25   16   15   15   10   20   7   16   15   13   15.2   4.94       a.  State any assumptions about the distribution of the data that are necessary to do part (b). b.  Is there any evidence that the average time for retrieving an image is different when it is retrieved from a library of slides than when retrieved from a computer database? Use a=0.01. State the null and alternate hypotheses, compute the test statistic, give the rejection or fail-to-reject region(s), report the conclusion of the test, and interpret it.
A serving of Amy's Organic Margherita Pizza frozen pizza contains 30 g of carbohydrates, 11 g of lipids (fat), and 11 g of protein. 1. Calculate the calories from carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. 2. Then calculate the percent of calories from each of the classes of nutrients. 3. Compare these percentages to the AMDR.  The AMDR for carbohydrate is 55-70%, for fat is 15-25%, and for protein is 7-20% of the energy intake for adults.   Is this something that you would advise a client to eat on a regular basis?

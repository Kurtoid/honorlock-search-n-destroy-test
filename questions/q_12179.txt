A girl causes a merry-go-round, which is is initially at rest, to start turning by pulling with a force F=125 N while running on the ground at its edge. She pulls either by grabbing a railing at the edge (a distance R=1.90 m from the center) and pulling sideways, or by grabbing a railing closer the the merry-go-round's center (a distance 3R/4 from the center) and pulling at an angle of th=55deg to the radial direction.

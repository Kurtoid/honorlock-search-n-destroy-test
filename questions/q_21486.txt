The owner of a private nature preserve rented snowmobiles in the winter season for use on designated trails on his property. When he was called out of town suddenly on a family emergency and could not get anyone to cover for him, he secured the snowmobiles with a cable and closed up the rental office. Later that day two 11-year-old boys came onto the owner's property even though they knew that the office was closed. Both of them had used the snowmobiles (with an adult) several times in the past. They were able to cut the cable and took two snowmobiles onto the trail. Although helmets were sitting in an open shed nearby, neither boy put one on. When they were out on the trail, one of the boys took a turn too fast and lost control. He fell off and hit a tree, sustaining severe and permanent brain injury. Had he been wearing a helmet, his injuries would have been much less severe. The boy's parents bring an action on their son's behalf against the property owner.

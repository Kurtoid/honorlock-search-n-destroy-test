An experiment was conducted to determine the fatigue limit (MPa) of rope wires. Shown below is the five-number summary of the data based on fatigue limit measurements of 60 rope wires.                                350        364        371        378        392   Approximately how many of the rope wires had a fatigue limit greater than 364 MPa?
Consider a local network that has a router using DHCP and NAT. When a host joins the network, it obtains its own IP address and the router's IP address using the [b1] protocol. It also obtains the MAC address of the router using the [b2] protocol. When the host sends packets outside the local network, the [b3] [b4] in the header are modified. The recipient of the packet [b5] distinguish between specific hosts on the local network.

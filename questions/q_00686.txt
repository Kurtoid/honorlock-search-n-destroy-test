As shown in class, a hectare-15 cm of a typical mineral soil that has a bulk density of 1.33 g cm-3 has a mass of ~2 X 106 kg. A hectare is 10,000 m2. Use that information to solve the following problem. Keep track of your units! Suppose you uniformly apply a pesticide to the surface of a typical mineral soil at a rate of 10 kg active ingredient per hectare. Previous research suggests that the chemical is persistent (degrades very slowly) and relatively immobile in the soil (should not penetrate deeper than 15 cm). Several months later, you sample the top 15 cm of the soil and analyze for the pesticide. What is the maximum concentration of the chemical you should expect to find? Express your answer in terms of parts per million (ppm).

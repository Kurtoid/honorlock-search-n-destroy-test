Water is the working fluid in an ideal regenerative Rankine cycle. Superheated vapor enters the turbine at 10 MPa, 480degC, and the condenser pressure is 6 kPa.   Steam expands through the first-stage turbine to 0.7 MPa where some of the steam is extracted and diverted to an open feedwater heater operating at 0.7 MPa.  The remaining steam expands through the second-stage turbine to the condenser pressure of 6 kPa.  Saturated liquid exits the feedwater heater at 0.7 MPa.  Determine for the cycle.   a.

Schedule the following list of instructions to minimize the number of cycles for the VLIW machine that was described in assignment 4. I have included the latencies that you assumed for the assignment in the table below for your convenience. Remember that you can perform register renaming of FP registers, adjust offsets of memory references, and merge integer increments to improve the code.  I suggest you cut and paste the VLIW Instructions table into your answer and then schedule the instructions into the table.

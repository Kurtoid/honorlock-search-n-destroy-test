You are interested in receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and you are purifying a novel phosphotyrosine-binding protein (NPBP-1).  In order to characterize this protein you need to separate it from three other proteins (X, Y, and Z) that are still present in your partially purified material.  The proteins in your preparation have the following properties:            binds to phosphotyrosine   Size (kDa)   pI     protein X   yes   85   7.2     protein Y   yes   29   2.9     protein Z   no   31   7.4     NPBP-1   yes   28   7.5       A. What type of separation technique can be used to separate protein NPBP-1 from protein X? [1] B. What type of separation technique can be used to separate protein NPBP-1 from protein Y? [2] C. What type of separation technique can be used to separate protein NPBP-1 from protein Z? [3]

Use the following information to answer Questions 20 - 25.  Consider a data set consisting of  countries for a study on factors affecting regime stability in Sub-Saharan Africa. A Poisson model was fit with the response miltcoup, the number of successful coups from independence to 1989, and the predictor oligarchy, the number of years the country was ruled by military oligarchy from independence to 1989.

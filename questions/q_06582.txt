A person was born with a genetic defect in the gene that codes for the protein creatine.  This genetic defect results in abnormally high levels of phosphocreatine in the skeletal muscle.  In fact, the levels of phosphocreatine are 2 times higher than what is normally found in the average person.  If this person with the genetic defect were to perform a bout of maximal intensity exercise (i.e. a sprint) at the same time as an average person, how would the genetic defect alter the person's ability to make ATP throughout this sprint relative to the average person and WHY?

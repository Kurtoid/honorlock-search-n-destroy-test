Skill B3.  Henrion et al. (2016) described the problem of decommissioning 27 oil and gas platforms off the coast of California.  Six alternatives for decommissioning the offshore platforms have been identified. The key attributes are the costs (less is better), environmental impact (None is best; Worst is worst), compliance with existing regulations (yes is better), and ocean access (more is better). The attributes of the alternatives are given in the following table:     Alternative   Cost ($ million)   Environmental Impact   Compliance   Ocean access     CRC   250   Poor   Yes   More     CREX   220   Worst   Yes   More     PRTIP   100   Some   No   No change     PR85   125   Some   No   No change     LIPDIV   0   None   No   No change     LIPAE   50   None   No   No change     The decision-makers will use a linear multiattribute utility function to model their preferences.  The weights on the four attributes are 0.45, 0.30, 0.20, 0.05.  The utility function for cost is linear.  For environmental impact, u("Poor") = 0.1, and u("Some") = 0.5.  Which alternative is the best one given these preferences?

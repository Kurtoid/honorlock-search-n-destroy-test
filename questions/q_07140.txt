The University of Florida was interested in assessing the effectiveness of a new messaging campaign designed to improve the image of the athletic department. The researchers recruited 500 alumni to be part of the study. For the study, these alumni would be added to an email list that would periodically send them new advertisements regarding UF's athletic department and have them fill out surveys regarding UF athletics. The goal of the research team was to assess if seeing these messages improved the participants feelings about UF athletics. The study was designed to last for 3 months. Over the course of the three months, 150 people ended up dropping out of the study (i.e., they stopped filling out surveys). In essence, the sample went from 500 to 350. By the end of the three months, the researchers found that the participants who had seen the messages reported having more positive feelings about UF athletics. Based on our discussion of threats to internal validity, these results may not be accurate. What threat to validity might apply to this study that would lead us to be more cautious with these findings?

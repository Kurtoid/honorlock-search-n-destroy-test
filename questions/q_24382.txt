Use this copy of the MISSED ASSIGNMENTS AND MAKE-UP POLICY section of the COURSE SYLLABUS to answer the below questions Missed Assignment and Make-Up Policy With the exception of the last Discussion assignment and the Final Exam, ALL graded assignments are available for students to complete beginning the first day of the semester and remain available to students until the posted due date and time (listed at the end of this course syllabus).  Therefore, students cannot make up missed assignments unless they can provide verifiable documentation attesting to extenuating circumstances beyond their personal responsibility that have caused them to miss the posted deadlines.  Circumstances such as a verifiable medical excuse from a doctor, verifiable military service, or verifiable death of an immediate family member are examples of circumstances that warrant a deadline extension.  Connectivity, other computer type issues, personal issues, or any other issues that occur within the final day of online assignment availability are not valid reasons for a "reset" or deadline extension.  The instructor is the sole determinant of the validity of any student make-up request. To compensate for the no make-up policy, the course gradebook has been set to drop the lowest Discussion Forum grade, lowest SmartBook grade, and the lowest Test grade (Test 1 - 3 or Final Exam) for each student.     Note:  LegalDictionary.net states that "The law defines a person's immediate family for legal purposes as a person's father, mother, parent's spouse (if a parent has remarried), child (by blood, adoption, or marriage), brother, sister, spouse, grandparent, grandchild."

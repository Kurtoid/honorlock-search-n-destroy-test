Please read the following scenario to answer the following questions.CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas (GHG) that impacts global climate change. Other GHGs may be equally or more effective than CO2 at trapping heat on Earth. Climate scientists determine how much a GHG may impact global warming based on two factors: the efficiency with which a GHG absorbs energy (i.e., traps heat on Earth) and the length of time (in years) that the gas remains in the atmosphere. A unit of measurement called the Global Warming Potential (GWP) is used to describe how much energy a GHG absorbs over a specific period of time (100 years is a standard time frame). All GWP values of GHGs are compared to the GWP of CO2, which is given a value of 1.Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are greenhouse gases that, for a specific amount of mass, trap significantly more heat than CO2. How can you classify CFCs?

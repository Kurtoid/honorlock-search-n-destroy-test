Sensory deficits or disorders during development can have a profound impact on the developing brain and, hence, on the development of normal cognition, language, and/or movement.  Choose one type of sensory processing disorder to discuss. a. How would this sensory processing disorder leand to a different pattern of brain development and organization  from that found in typically developing brains.  b. Discuss how these brain differences would be reflected in long-lasting differences in cognition, language, social functioning, and/or movement.  (max. 30 points)
Belinda asked her teacher, "What could make turtles go faster?" Her teacher replied, "I don't know. See if you could find out." So Belinda did a lot of research in the library and come upon the idea that eating carrots will make turtles go faster. She decided to test her ten turtles. She fed five turtles their normal turtle food. She fed the other five carrots. All the turtles got their normal sleep and water requirements. Then, after a week she had a turtle race. She kept a record of the times and realized that she was wrong. In fact, all the carrot-eating turtles finished last. What was her independent variable?

An auditor is auditing a company to the requirements of both ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015. For the following audit situation, write the nonconformance statements that apply and any weakness or opportunity for improvement statements that you deem appropriate based on the evidence provided. Note that there may be more than one nonconformance statement. Follow the guidelines for developing nonconformance statements given in class, clearly identifying the evidence, nature, and requirement. If necessary, state any assumptions. The auditor is reviewing One Cool Corporation's quoting and sales processes with the Sales Manager - Macey - and several Sales Associates. The auditor asks if there is a documented procedure for the quoting and sales process. One Sales Associate - Norah -  responds, "Sure there is. It's right here." She pulls down a flowchart that is pinned to a wall in her cubicle. Another Sales Associate -  Sarah - chimes in, "Yes, that is very similar to the one that I have, although yours appears to be a bit different - probably because of the recent software updates to our order processing system." The auditor reviews the flowchart and asks Sarah what she looks for on a customer order when it is received. She replies, "First, I make sure that I know just what the customer is asking for. If it is an existing product, I make sure that the part number is in our order processing software system, and that I know what revision number and price they are looking for. I compare their order against the quotation provided to them to make sure everything matches up. If I have any questions, I check with Macey or sometimes even with the Engineers or the Production Manager to address any issues before I accept the order." Sarah continues, "For new products that are going to require some product design work, I work closely with Engineering to develop a quotation, particularly when we don't currently have the manufacturing capability in-house to produce the product." The auditor then asks what happens when One Cool Corporation doesn't currently have the manufacturing capability in-house to produce products. Macey replies, "Nine times out of ten we simply outsource the manufacturing activity. We don't really have the financial capital right now to buy all the new machines that might be required, and we certainly don't have the expertise to run them. We usually just run a quick internet search to find a local manufacturer that has the necessary capability, and if the cost is reasonable we use them." Norah nods her head in agreement. The auditor asks Macey what she does if a new or changed product might affect One Cool Corporation's environmental aspects.  She replies, "What are environmental aspects?  Maybe Engineering does something with that, but I don't really know". The auditor asks to see a sample of records of some recently accepted orders. Macey replies, "Here are some from the last two weeks. Unfortunately, since we maintain our order records on the computer network in the order processing software, we lost all of our previous records when we updated the software last month. The system crashed and we lost all of the electronic data!" The auditor notices one particular order where the customer required a Certificate of Conformance to be shipped with the product, and asks Sarah about it. Sarah replies, "I know that shipping didn't provide them with that, because the customer called to complain about it. We completed a Corrective Action Request to deal with the complaint, but, to be honest, we still really don't have a very good system in place to communicate those kinds of requirements to the production people." The auditor then asks Sarah, Norah, and Macey about One Cool Corporation's Quality and Environmental Policy Statement. Sarah and Macey quickly recite it from memory: "To Make People Excited About Being A One Cool Customer". Norah, however, admits that she missed that part of the training during a cigarette break and did not know what it was.

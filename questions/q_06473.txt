Determine whether the sampling is dependent or independent:   A researcher wishes to determine the effects of alcohol on people's reaction time to a stimulus.  She randomly selects 100 people to participate in the study.  She has the subjects perform a series of tests meant to measure reaction time.  Then, she gives each individual 3 oz of alcohol.  After thirty minutes, she asks the subjects to complete the tasks again and measures their reaction time.

For the MOSFET Amplifier problem where several parameters are being asked to be calculated utilize the same MOSFET current mirror diagram and the table of values.  Please read the 1st one and know that all questions are written out there so you work off that  information on the whole problem on your papers and once done, you just click your right answer choice from the multiple choices for each of the problems that follow individually where one of the several parameters is asked to be found.                    Vdd = 4.4V              Gnd                                        Gnd                Fig: MOSAMP                                            MOSAMP Table The bias current of this circuit is 1.8mA. The load capacitance (CL) is 5pF.The PMOS current mirror is 1:1. Assume everything is in the saturation region. Include proper units for full credit and show your work.  Unless otherwise specified and if appropriate, give an equation and a number answer. For the circuit shown above, answer the following questions:(i)    Given the bias current above, what is the width of device 2? (Ignore channel length modulation (l)). (6pts)(ii)    What is the width of device 1? (Again, ignore channel length modulation (l)). (4pts)(iii)    What are the numerical values of the transconductance (gm1) and output conductance (go1) of device 1?  (4pts) (iv)    What is the numerical value of the output conductance (go2) of device 2?  (2pts)(v)    Draw the small signal model. What is the numeric value of the small signal gain (vo/vin)? (10pts)(vi)     What is the output resistance, in kOhms, measured at Vout? (4pts)   For this question,  (i)    Given the bias current above, what is the width of device 2? (Ignore channel length modulation (l)). (6pts)

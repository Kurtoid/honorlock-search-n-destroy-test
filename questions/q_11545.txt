Academic Honor Code Please read the following document carefully, and select the option at the end of the document.      The Chipola College Honor Code is based on the premise that each student has the responsibility to (1) uphold the highest standards of academic honesty in his/her own work; (2) refuse to tolerate academic dishonesty in the college community; and (3) foster a high sense of honor and social responsibility on the part of students.   Violations      Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to having or providing unauthorized outside help.  Any student who observes or learns of another student's academic dishonesty should report this violation to the instructor in whose class it has taken place.  A student who shall have assisted in the dishonesty mentioned above shall be considered equally guilty as the student who accepts such assistance. Consequences      Chipola College expects students to be honest in all of their academic work.  By enrolling at the College, students agree to adhere to the Academic Honor Code and understand that failure to comply with this code may result in academic and disciplinary action. Online Proctored Testing To utilize Honorlock, students must adhere to the Chipola College Academic Honor Code and the Online Testing Requirements listed below. Chipola College reserves the right to require a re-test at an approved proctor location. Failure to follow proper online testing requirements may result in a zero (0) grade for your exam and/or additional consequences as outlined in the Student Governance section of the Chipola College catalog. Online Testing Requirements The online testing environment and testing area should mimic that of the "in class" testing environment.  Online Testing includes the following requirements:  No writing visible on desk or on walls. No websites other than Canvas and the Honorlock proctoring extension should be used or open while taking a proctored exam. Close all other programs and/or windows on the testing computer prior to logging into the proctored test environment. Make sure music/televisions are not playing in the background. Communication or receiving assistance from others is not permitted during a proctored assessment. No other persons except the test-taker should be in the room during testing. Using a phone or any other electronic device, other than your test-taking device, is not permitted. Remain visible in the web camera during the entire duration of the exam. Leaving the room during the testing period is not permitted. You must not take the computer into another room to finish testing (exam must be completed in the same room the "Exam Environment View" is completed in). Headphones or smart watches are not permitted. Dual monitors are not permitted. Caps/hats are not permitted. Textbooks, notes, etc. are not permitted unless clearly stated in the testing instructions provided at the beginning of the exam. Unless your instructor allows notes, textbook or other materials, keep your eyes on your screen, not focused on any other area of the desk or room. Sit at a clean desk or table (not on a bed or couch) Lighting in the room must be bright enough to be considered "daylight" quality. Overhead lighting is preferred; however, if overhead is not possible, the source of light should not be behind the student Ensure your desk or table is cleared of all other materials. When prompted to do a room scan, be sure to carefully include your desk/work area in your scan. Make sure to do a complete 360-degree rotation of your room, then show your work space. Replay your room scan for verification. Partial scans and/or failure to show your work space may be flagged during the proctoring review and may result in a zero (0) grade on the exam. Make sure your laptop is fully charged, or keep the charger within arm's reach. When prompted to provide a photo ID, make sure your fingers do not cover any information on the ID. Photo capture of the photo ID must be clearly legible, and photo must clearly represent the student taking the exam.  You may refer to the Academic Honor Code section of the Chipola Catalog under Student Governance--Student Rights, Responsibilities and Code of Conduct for additional information on conduct that constitutes academic dishonesty and consequences of such conduct.

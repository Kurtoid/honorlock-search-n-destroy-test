Some students have been told that people remember words written in green ink better than red ink. Therefore, I collected data from 2 sections of Psych 202. My 2:30 pm class had a list of words in green ink to memorize (group 1). My 4:00 pm class had a list of words in red ink to memorize (group 2). After a 10 minute delay, students in both classes recalled as many words as they could. My 2:30 pm class with green ink had a mean of 27.5 words, SS = 720, n = 36. My 4:00 pm class with red ink had a mean of 23.5 words, SS = 610, n = 36. Together their pooled variance is 19.

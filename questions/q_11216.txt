While calcium does not get used to create wires very often, it is a reasonably good conductor. Imagine that I create a 100 ft (30.48 m) length of 20 AWG (American Wire Gauge) calcium wire. The 20 AWG tells us the diameter is 0.0316 in or 0.803 mm. When 35.0 mV is applied from one end of the wire to the other end, a 17.3 mA current moves through the wire. What is the resistivity of calcium?
The wine dataset contains information on the chemical composition of various wines, along with a consumer rating of quality, which ranges from 1 to 9.  You wish to examine what makes a good wine and build a rpart regression tree model with quality as the dependent variable and all other variables in the dataset as independent variables.  You create the rpart tree and then visualize it using the prp() function.  What information can you get from nodes 9 and 13?  Explain the chain of independent variables that lead to the nodes and explain the numbers inside the colored boxes (5.6,15%) and (6.1,19%).

GELO #6 - Question 7 Carl is conducting an experiment to determine if increased ultraviolet radiation from the decrease in the ozone layer is killing off frog tadpoles. After examining all of the data available in the library, Carl decides to go with a hypothesis that increased ultraviolet radiation from the sun is killing off the tadpoles.    Carl puts tadpoles into two groups. Group 1 involves 100 tadpoles in a five gallon container of water, which is covered by glass (knowing that the glass will filter out the ultraviolet radiation). Group 2 will be set up exactly like Group 1, except instead of being covered with glass, it is covered with an acrylic plexiglass, which will not filter out the ultraviolet radiation. Carl then places the groups outside for a period of one month, and observes the results.      Do the results of this experiment support Carl's hypothesis?

Be sure to show your work and to answer all parts of this question. Competing in a hot market, a manufacturer of wooden rulers must reduce the percentage of defective rulers on the line producing its #1 seller - the "12-305" model which displays both 12 inch and 305 mm scales on the same side! Rulers are inspected for three defects: too long, blurred markings, and rough finish. Workers pulled a random sample of 250,000 rulers, and found 10 rulers with a total of 15 defects.   Estimate PPM. Estimate DPMO. Does this process meet Motorola's Six Sigma quality level? Explain your answer.
A compressed ideal gas of unknown density flows through a section of expanding pipe 20 meters long with an inlet diameter of (D = 10 cm) and an outlet diameter of (D = 25 cm). The gage pressure of the air at the inlet of the pipe is 350 kPa and it exits to atmospheric pressure at the end of the pipe. The volume flow rate of air as it exits the pipe is 1.5 m3/s.  The temperature of the air remains constant within the pipe. What is the velocity of the air at the pipe inlet?

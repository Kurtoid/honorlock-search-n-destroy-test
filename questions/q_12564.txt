What type of species is described in both of the following passages? Environmental Scientists are often able to monitor the status and health of an entire ecosystem simply by monitoring the status and health of (?) present in that ecosystem. This is possible because environmental problems show up quickly in species that are very sensitive to environmental change and, so, once a problem is detected early in the sensitive species, scientists can identify the problem rapidly and fix it before it begins to affect the rest of the ecosystem and the less sensitive species living there.   Ecologists are often able to identify and classify a particular community in the environment just by identifying or detecting a single (?) within it.  This is because some species are only found in certain communities, never outside of them, so if we spot such a species, then we can know instantly the name of the community or ecosystem we're looking at. The passages above reveal the two different ways scientists use the term, (?).

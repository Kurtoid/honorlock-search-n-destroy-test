Problem 4. Renewable energy makes up roughly 10% of the US energy consumption which totals ~100x1015 BTU. Active solar heating is one energy source that has a lot of potential to increase this value. The average solar irradiance in Alabama (IT) is 5 kWh/m2/Day (1584 BTU/ft2/day). If a house in Alabama installed one (1) tubular collector, (a) how much useful energy could be collected? The average January ambient temperature (Ta) is 6.5 degC (43.8 degF) and the average temperature of the house (Tin) is 18.3degC (65degF). (b) How does your calculated value of total useful energy compare with the value given by the manufacture? You can see the results from the manufacturer in the table below. (c) What could be the maximum temperature when the flow rate is zero? Information on the solar collector can be found in below.

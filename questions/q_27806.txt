Explain why it is important to ensure that all students are exposed to grade-level, complex text. For full credit, your answer should be a well written (minimum of 5 sentences) paragraph. You answers should reflect an understanding of the information presented in the Adams article and our class discussions.
Two identical platters have a shaft that they can rotate around.  The shaft is centered on the platters.  One is rotating with o= 1.4 rad/s and the other initially nonrotating one is dropped on the first.  After this the angular momentum of the entire system is:

Colin is chair of the city council and wants another term.  Rose is on the council and is running against him for chair.  There is a vote next week on whether to give city employees raises.  If both Colin and Rose vote for the raises Colin will win 5 points in the election.  If both of them vote against the raises then Colin wins 5 points.  If Rose votes for the raises and Colin votes against them, Rose gains 7 points .  If Colin votes for the raises and Rose votes against them, they both stay as they are.  Assuming this game is zero sum, make a matrix and an evolution diagram for this game and upload it.
Lecture Test 3, Question  The diagram below shows the den position of a cougar and 5 possible locations where the cougar might find prey.  Examine this diagram and answer the associated questions.            a.  Write the profitability equation and define the terms.  Hint, there are 3 terms.      b.  Suppose the two patches closest to the den contain high energy prey items.  Under what conditions would it be more profitable for the cougar to hunt in the three more distant patches rather than the two closest patches?

Well flow (20 pts): An unconfined aquifer water table is 12.2 m thick has a full penetrating well with a diameter of 4-in (0.1 m). The extraction rate is 0.15 m3/min in the aquifer that is sandy with a hydraulic conductivity of 8.2 m/day.  A steady-state drawdown of 1.5 m is observed in a monitoring well at 3.0 m from the pumping well. Determine the: a. ) drawdown in the pumping well at this pumping rate, and b.) minimum distance from the pumping well that a monitoring well must installed in order for there to be no drawdown observed (in the monitoring well) (i.e., where is s= 0.0 m).
I decide that for the final exam, we do something new in the name of science. First, we have a pre-test the day before the final. The day of the actual exam, I randomly assign half the class to the experimental group, which has to run as fast as they can up the hill from the Health Science Center to Turlington Hall during the test period, and then take the exam in whatever time remains. The control group gets to spend the two-hour period in the room with the exam. The pre-test scores for both groups are the same, and both groups show the same increase on the post-test. This means _____.

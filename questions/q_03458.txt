A heated, low-rate anaerobic digester is to be designed for an activated sludge WWTP treating the wastewater from a service area with a population of 25,000 people. The fresh sludge contains 0.25 lb dry solids/cap-day, volatile solids are 70% of the dry solids., the dry solids are 5% of the sludge, and the wet specific gravity is 1.01. Sixty-five percent of the volatile solids are destroyed by anaerobic digestion and the fixed solids remain unchanged. The digested sludge has 7% dry solids and a wet specific gravity of 1.03. The operating temperature of the digest is 95 degF and the sludge storage time is 45 days. The sludge occupies the lower half of the tank depth, and the supernatant, scum and gas occupy the upper half of the tank depth. Determine the followings.   Given data  With service area population of 25,000, sludge produced: 6,250 lb dry solids/day Fresh sludge production: 0.25 lb dry solids/cap-day Fresh sludge: 70% VSS; dry solids = 5% of sludge, wet SG = 1.01 VSS reduction: 65% Digested sludge: dry solids = 7% of sludge; wet SG = 1.03 Operating temperature (T): 95 degF Sludge storage time (tS): 45 days Fraction of sludge in digestor (a): 0.5     (4 pts) Fresh sludge volume which is added to the digester (V1) (unit: ft3 sludge/day) (Hint: change mass flow to volumetric flow using V1=T/[

I want to find the area of a window to buy glass.  It is a rectangle with a triangle on top, and I am trying to use this formula:     Clearly explain how you can tell this is wrong without even knowing any area formulas.
This is a high power view of the cortex of the kidney with PAS stain. Identify the tubular structure in this slide.
A patient comes into your office with complaints about eye fatigue and focusing problems towards the end of the day.  During your history you find out that the patient spends 8 hours a day on the computer.  Your refraction yielded these results: Distance OD:  +2.25+2.25x90  OS:  +2.75+2.00x90  with +2.00 add OU Write a prescription for a pair of computer flat top bifocals to give this patient the most comfortable clear vision during their work day.  OD Rx goes in the 1st blank and OS in 2nd.
42.The nurse has received her assignment for the day and notices that her peer has a much lighter assignment in both number and acuity of patients. This is not the first time the nurse has noticed this inequity in assignments. She also has seen her peer and the charge nurse go to lunch together and knows that they spend time outside of work socializing. The nurse feels that this constant inequity in assignment is not fair. What is the best course of action for the nurse to address this problem?
What are the three technician positions on a process unit?
Which is NOT true about summation?
Explain the mechanism of action for the two types of receptor classes: Nuclear Receptors vs Membrane-bound receptors. What TYPES of hormones stimulate each? What is the ULTIMATE (end result) of activation of each receptor type? Only one mechanism of action for membrane-bound receptors is necessary, if described well. Possible terminology: G-proteins, enzyme, intracellular mediator kinase, phosphorylation, water-soluble and/or lipid-soluble, nonpolar and/or polar, hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic, signal amplification, ligand, ion channel. Not all suggestions or terminology are required. Please make sure to demonstrate understanding of any terminology used. Proper usage of more basic terminology to demonstrate concept is highly encouraged over improper usage of more technical terminology. SIMPLE SENTENCES ARE YOUR FRIEND, but not mandatory. This is not an English paper.

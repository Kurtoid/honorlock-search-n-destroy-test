Recent studies regarding long term cell phone usage strongly suggest that brain development for children under 5 years old can be affected by long term exposure to the low level radiation they emit.  The same study showed that cognitive function decreased in males exposed to the rays at all ages.  The study, published in the Journal Nature, has been widely accepted across the scientific community.  The Telecommunications Act authorizes the FCC to "oversee the marketing and labeling requirements for all cellular products sold in the United States."  Intense political pressure by telecommunications giants has kept the issue of the agenda of federal government agencies.   On January 2, 2008, after learning of the studies, Mothers Against Cell Phones (MACP) filed a legislative rulemaking petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requesting that they require a warning label on cell phone packaging that informs consumers of the risks posed to infants and toddlers.  As of January 22, 2012, the FCC had not acted on the petition.   If a reviewing court hears a challenge by MACP regarding their petition they will:

You are holding a sheep's heart in an anatomical position in this picture. The arrows are showing this vessel:
A 12 V permanent magnet dc starting motor for a gasoline engine is geared to the engine flywheel through a 5:1 speed reducer. The rotational moment of inertia of the engine is 10.0 kg*m2, and the friction constant is 0.5 Nxmxsec.  Neglect any load other mechanical losses. The starting motor produces a torque of 0.8 N*m per ampere of armature current.  The starting motor's armature circuit resistance is 0.1  and its rotational moment of inertia is negligible.   Assume that the armature electrical time constant of the motor is neglected. If a 12 V dc voltage supply is connected to the armature at time t=0, calculate the amount of time, t, required for the engine to reach a speed of 10 rad/sec from standstill. Now suppose that the armature inductance is NOT neglected, and La = 120 mH.  Determine the roots (or poles) of the characteristic equation of the motor response to a change in vt, as in part a).

A dumbbell shaped mass is made by attaching point masses, m1 = m0 and m2 = m0 to the ends of a long thin rod, m3 = 3m0 , length = 2d.  The apparatus is set spinning at a rate of o0 about an axis through the center of the rod, and perpendicular to the rod.  Find the kinetic energy of the system.  Symbolic solution.  Simplify. REMEMBER to show work to camera immediately before submitting test.
A structure consists of springs with following stiffnesses: k1 = 105 N/m k2 = 2 x 105 N/m k3 = 3 x 105 N/m The springs are connected in series as shown in the figure below.  The ends of the system are fixed and an axial load of magnitude 1000 N is applied at node 2 as shown in the figure.      Write the stiffness matrices for each of the elements Using the assembly of elements, formulate the stiffness matrix of the structure WITHOUT CONSTRAINTS. Write the stiffness matrix of the CONSTRAINED structure with boundary conditions applied as indicated. Determine the displacement of node 2 and node 3?  (5-Points Each)
Use the definition of the derivative to find the derivative of the function f(x)=x2+4x+2{"version":"1.1","math":"f(x)=x2+4x+2"}. You must use the definition of the derivative for this problem. You may not use any of our shortcuts for finding derivatives for this problem.  Because I care about how you work this problem, you MUST upload your work for this problem to the Dropbox folder "Work for Test #1" or you will not get any points for this problem. You will be graded on your work for this problem. The definition of the derivative says that  f'(x) = limh-0f(x+h)-f(x)h{"version":"1.1","math":"f'(x) = limh-0f(x+h)-f(x)h"}.

Vitamin C  or ascorbic acid is a vital antioxidant necessary for life. Vitamin C is a cofactor in at least 8 enzymatic reactions including  several collagen synthesis reactions that when dysfunctional cause scurvy. Mass analysis  of vitamin C determined the molecular weight to be 176g and percent analysis was 40.04% C, 4.55 % H, and 55.41% O. Determine both the empirical formula and molecular formula for this compound. Be sure to clearly label each formula. Atomic masses C- 12.01g/mol H- 1.008g/mol O 16.00g/mol

38. To test for the presence of starch, iodine can be used. A positive reaction results in a blue black color. A semipermeable dialysis bag filled with starch solution and secured on both ends is placed in iodine solution. After 30 minutes the dialysis bag appears blue black. Based on this information, what most accurately describes what happened? A) Due to its size and polarity, starch was able to exit the dialysis bag and interact with the iodine solution. B) Due to its size and polarity, iodine was able to enter the dialysis bag and interact with starch. C) Over time, both iodine and starch are equally distributed throughout the two solutions.D) Due to the large pore size of the membrane starch move out of the membrane.

The following table reflects the results of a study by Roediger and Karpicke (2006). The authors investigated whether the test-enhanced learning effect (the demonstration that repeated testing improves memory for material) was due merely to repeated exposure to the material. They randomly assigned participants to one of two study conditions (study-study or study-test) and to one of three retention interval conditions (final test at a delay of 5 minutes, 2 days, or 1 week). The dependent variable was the proportion of idea units recalled from an encyclopedia passage.Table: Test-Enhanced Learning         5 minutes   2 days   1 week   Mean     Study-study   0.80   0.55   0.42   0.59     Study-test   0.75   0.70   0.55   0.67     Mean   0.78   0.63   0.49           Reference: Ref 14-1 (Table: Test-Enhanced Learning) Based on the cells of this study, which effects appear to be present?

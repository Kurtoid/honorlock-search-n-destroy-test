Some photosynthetic organisms run a "reverse" TCA cycle to meet their metabolic needs for carbon. These organisms produce ATP and reducing power (NADH) using a light-driven photosynthetic electron transport chain rather than NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) or Succinate dehydrogenase (complex II)-driven electron transport chain. Light promotes electron transport generating a proton gradient that is subsequently used by complex V. The carbon needs for these organisms are satisfied by utilizing acetate (formed by two molecules of CO2), which can be converted to acetyl-CoA. As shown below, three amino acid metabolic pathways are directly linked to the reverse TCA cycle, and carbon fixation refers to the production of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which can be subsequently fed into any metabolic pathway for production of necessary carbon compounds in this organism. Based upon your understanding of metabolic regulation, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle, answer the questions on the following page.       a) Indicate the enzyme classification numbers for enzymes (noted in boxes with various digits) that you would predict as distinct from those normally associated with the "forward" TCA cycle and pyruvate metabolism. Provide a brief explanation for your choices. b) Suggest a model for carbon metabolism regulation in these organisms for those pathways represented. How are carbon fixation, glutamate production, alanine production, and aspartate production balanced?  c) Propose a detailed model for how carbon and energy metabolism in these organisms are regulated in respect to one another. (How does acetate metabolism respond under various energy generating conditions?? )

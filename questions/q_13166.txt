Orphy was so excited that he immediately hopped on a bus from Florida to Wyoming (wearing a mask, of course) to visit the famous spot in Yellowstone National Park!  He was pleased to see in the seatback pocket a copy of Skymall, his favorite shopping magazine.  He was particularly interested in the "ancestry and medical" DNA test offered by 23andMe for just $199.99. He pulled out his iPhone6 and immediately placed an order for the test kit - he didn't like being poked by needles for a blood test, remembering his time as a premed, but he figured collecting a saliva sample would be easy. When Orphy got to Yellowstone, he hiked directly to the famous spring, then pulled a thermometer and pH meter from his backpack to check the water in the spring.  He found the temperature to be 70oC and the pH to be 6.60.  Based on the value for Kw for water at 70oC that he found in his Farmer's Almanac (Kw 70C = 2.1 x 10-13), is the water in the spring acidic, basic, or neutral ?  (choose one, and then explain your answer). Turn in your work if you want partial credit!

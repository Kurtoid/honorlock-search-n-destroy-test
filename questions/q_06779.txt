Bangs Leisure Chairs produces three types of hand-crafted outdoor chairs that are popular for beach, pool, and patios - sling chairs, Adirondack chairs, and hammocks. The unit profit for these products is $40, $100, and $90, respectively. Each type of chair requires cutting, assembling, and finishing. The owner is retired and is available to work 6 hours per day for 5 days per week, so there will be 120 hours available each month. He doesn't want to spend more than 50 hours each month on any one activity (that is, no more than 50 hours on cutting, no more than 50 hours on assembling, no more than 50 hours on finishing, in a given month). The retailer who buys the chairs will buy all that can be produced. Sling chairs are made up of ten wood pieces for the frame and one piece of cloth. The actual cutting of the wood takes 30 minutes (0.5 hour). Assembling includes sewing of the fabric and the attachment of rivets, screws, fabric, and dowel rods and takes 45 minutes (0.75 hour). The finishing stage involves sanding, staining, and varnishing of the various parts and takes one hour. Adirondack chairs take 2 hours for cutting, 2 hours for assembling and 1 hour for finishing. Hammocks take 0.4 hour for cutting, 3 hours for assembling, and 1 hour for finishing.   Use the chairs worksheet Develop and solve an optimization model to  determine how many of each type of chair should be produced each month in order to maximize profit. The number of chairs produced should be a whole number -- no partial chairs. What is the maximum profit ?

Read the following scenario to answer the following question(s).Biomedical scientists have recently developed an anticancer drug delivery system that sneaks the anticancer drug into cancer cells before releasing it. They were able to do this by using two sets of liposomes. An anticancer drug (Doxorubicin (Dox)) bound to DNA molecules was added into one set of liposomes, and a high concentration of ATP molecules were added to the other set of liposomes. The drug is inactive when bound to DNA molecules. Researchers inject both types of liposomes into cancer cells, and upon doing so their contents are released. The ATP molecules from one set of liposomes bind to the DNA molecules from the other set of liposomes) and activate the drug, thus inducing cell death and decreasing tumor size.Mice with breast cancer tumors were treated with this liposome system to test the effectiveness of the drug. The scientists performed three trials-one with both types of liposomes (Dox + ATP), one with just the drug (Dox only), and one with a salt solution (control).

The Crown Bottling Company has just installed a new bottling process that will fill 16-ounce bottles of the popular Crown Classic Cola soft drink. Both overfilling and underfilling bottles are undesirable: Underfilling leads to customer complaints and overfilling costs the company considerable money. In order to verify that the filler is set up correctly, the company wishes to see whether the mean bottle fill, m, is close to the target fill of 16 ounces. To this end, a random sample is selected from the output of a test filler run. If the sample results cast a substantial amount of doubt on the hypothesis that the mean bottle fill is the desired 16 ounces, then the filler's initial setup will be readjusted. This is the output by Minitab.  Please answer the following questions based on the output.   Q1: What is the sample size? Q2: What is the sample mean? Q3: What is the alternative statement? Q4: What is the level of significance? (Hint: a) Q5: What is the value of test statistic? Q6: What is the p-value? (Please do NOT round your answer.)

A patient sued a hospital in federal court for medical negligence. The patient's complaint alleges the following: She was admitted to the hospital suffering from a serious lung infection. The doctors prescribed her a powerful antibiotic drug. After two days, her condition had greatly improved. The doctors then changed her prescription to a different, untested antibiotic. Over the course of the next three days, her symptoms rapidly worsened and she ended up suffering permanent lung damage. The doctors did not reinstate the use of the original antibiotic.The hospital moves to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. It argues that the patient has not adequately pleaded the element of causation: i.e., that the change in antibiotic caused the lung damage to occur. What should the federal court do?

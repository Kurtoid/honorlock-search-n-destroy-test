The magnificent church called Sagrada Familia in Barcelona is just one example of the unique architectural work of the artist _________________. His work is bold, eccentric and a bit over the top.

Read the following prompt and type your response. You will begin and end it in class. If you open it, you cannot close it and go back to it. Use your own words from the grammar and vocabulary you have learned in this course, even if it sounds simple to you. You are NOT ALLOWED to use online translators of any type. If the use of a translator is suspected it will be dealt with as an academic dishonesty case which will result in a zero. You are allowed to use your book to remind you of the grammar and vocabulary that you have learned.  If you need an accented letter or other special character in your answer, copy and paste the character you need from this list into the answer box: a e i o u u n A E I O U ! ? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Writing Topic: Write an email to a friend describing your life as an MSU college student. You can pretend it is a regular semester if that helps you use more Spanish.   Tell your friend about your classes and schedule.  Tell them what you do and when (think about the -ar verbs you just learned). Ask your friend a couple of questions as well.  Don't overthink it. If we haven't learned how to say what you are really taking, simplify the classes to the basics (instead of molecular biology, just tell them you are taking biologia). And remember, I am not double checking any of this info, so if it's easier to make it up, do it! Finally, you don't know enough Spanish to write a letter that sounds the way it would if you wrote it in English, so don't try! It is supposed to be simplistic (so don't use a translator...). Students always ask about length...just cover the topic. You will have to write at least 4-5 sentences to do that, I think, but I don't really count.   To begin a letter in Spanish, you can just use "Hola __________,". Some ways to end a letter in Spanish. Choose one:    SPANISH ENGLISH USE     Un saludo,   Cheers, informal     Saludos,   Best, informal     Espero saber de ti pronto,   Hope to hear from you soon, informal     Cuidate,   Take care, informal     Hablamos pronto,   Talk soon, informal

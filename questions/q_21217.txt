WRITTEN SECTION (500 Words). Topic: Ethics of Social Media. Social media can be an effective way to stay connected, to reach potential customers who may  patronize a particular business, or even to do research. However, social media also harbors the potential for information abuse. The internet has allowed us to find more information than ever before on any possible topic we can think of. Yet the power, speed, and research potential of online information must be balanced against the wide range of ideas presented, some of which are not factual and many of which could even be considered unethical.    Your Assignment: After reviewing the section in your textbook that discusses ethics in technical communication, you should have chosen a controversial topic that has ethical implications: for example, gun control, immigration laws, individual choice about vaccinations, bioengineered food and crops, etc. After choosing your controversial topic, you should have examined online social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, the Web) to compare the competing claims being made. Did you find examples of unethical communication such as conflicts of interest or exaggerated claims?    Be sure to compare the claims being made on the social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) to at least one credible, secondary source. (Example: This source could be from a reputable news organization that contradicts a post about a controversial topic made by an individual on Facebook.).   You will present your findings about the ethics of social media in a memo to your instructor and classmates. Follow all guidelines and conventions for writing memos as presented in your textbook.   Caution: You should have prepared for the written section by planning and drafting before the exam, but you must write the final copy of your memo from scratch during the exam period. You also may not use the internet or any outside material during the exam.

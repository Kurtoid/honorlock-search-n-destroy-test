Problem 1 A bridge supports five forces.  The magnitude of the forces P is 200 kN and the magnitude of the forces Q is 300 kN.  The dimension L is 10 m.  Determine the forces in the members CD, CJ, IJ, DJ, JE and JK.  (Make sure to show all required FBDs and the derived equations as part of your written work.)    Format:  For each of the member forces, enter a force magnitude with units and state if it is in tension (T) or in compression (C). FCD = [f_CD]     in   [TorC_Fcd]   FCJ = [f_CJ]     in   [TorC_Fcj]   FIJ = [f_IJ]     in   [TorC_Fij] FDJ = [f_DJ]     in   [TorC_Fdj] FJE = [f_JE]     in   [TorC_Fje] FJK = [f_JK]     in   [TorC_Fjk]

Consider the network fragment shown below, Node 1 has only two attached neighbors: Node 2 and Node 3. There is a destination Node "8" in the network that is not shown. The complete paths from Node 1, Node 2 and Node 3 to Node "8" are not shown. Node 1 receives updates from its neighbors that Node 2 has a minimum-cost path to destination Node "8" equal to 10, and Node 3 has a minimum cost path to Node "8" equal to 9. (All link costs in the network have strictly positive values.)  Provide Node 1's distance vectors (set of (next node, cost) values) for destinations Node 2, Node 3, and Node "8".  Answer format Distance vector from Node 1 to Node 2:  [NextNodeandCostto2] Enter (next node, cost), e.g., (Node Y, 45) Distance vector from Node 1 to Node 3: [NextNodeandCostto3]  Enter (next node, cost), e.g., (Node Y, 45) Distance vector from Node 1 to Node "8": [NextNodeandCostto8]  Enter (next node, cost), e.g., (Node Y, 45)

SECTION C QUESTION 4     Read the paragraph and study the diagram about biotechnology used in insulin production below to answer the questions that follow.    In the 1970s people suffering from diabetes mellitus used insulin from cattle or pigs, but this was expensive and time consuming. Moreover, insulin from other animals was not exactly the same as those in humans, causing many side-effects. Also, many people were against the use of animal insulin for ethical or religious reasons. This problem had to be solved and in the 1970s biotechnological companies began working on genetically modifying a bacterium to produce insulin by the insertion of a human gene. Many different methods were tried & tested, then finally in the early 1980's they succeeded. This was a great achievement in the science world. The process that is currently used to mass produce insulin today, is shown in the diagram below.   Adapted from: Insulin Production From Genetically Modified Bacteria Biology Essay (2021).

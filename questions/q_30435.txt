These questions are from the discretionary and mandatory access control module.  All students in a class belong to a group G and are able to access class resources because G is granted the necessary permissions. Assume Alice has tested out of a topic and does not need to take the quiz on this topic. The professor does not want Alice to have access to this quiz but wants Alice to remain in group G so she can access other resources. Also, the professor wants to grant access to the quiz to all other students by granting the desired access to G. The mechanisms provided by various operating systems can be used to meet this access control requirement. Explain how this can be achieved most efficiently and correctly in Linux with extended access control lists (EACLs) and in Windows.  (5+5  pts.)  Which of the following system best supports the separation of privilege design principle: Java, Hydra, Windows and Linux? Explain your answer, by comparing each of them. (5 pts.)  The Bell and La Padula (BLP) and Biba models either address confidentiality or integrity.  Which of these model addresses confidentiality? (1 pts.) Which one addresses integrity? (1 pts.) If we want to use BLP and Biba simultaneously to address both of these requirements, what will be the read and write rules (e.g., at what levels a certain user at level L can read or write). (3 pts.) Is there a drawback to using both of these models at the same time? Provide a brief explanation. (3 pts.)   A certain company has many customers and some of them have conflict-of-interest relationships. The people responsible for access provisioning came up with the following scheme. All files of a given customer must be stored in a single directory. A user U can access files in any directory at the beginning. However, once U accesses files in some directory, U's access to all other directories is turned off.     What policy discussed in the course is most similar to the above scheme? (3 pts.)  Is this policy correctly implemented by this scheme? Provide a brief justification for your answer. (5 pts.)

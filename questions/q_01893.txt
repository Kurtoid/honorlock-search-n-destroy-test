This problem is worth 30 points. G and L form a limited partnership. G, the general partner, contributes $80,000 and L, the limited partner, contributes $320,000. The partnership purchased commercial real estate on leased land for $2 million, paying $400,000 cash and borrowing $1,600,000 on a nonrecourse basis from a commercial lender (note that none of this $2 million is allocated to land since the land is leased). The terms of the loan require payment of interest only for the first five years.  The GL partnership agreement allocates all income, gain, loss and deductions  20% to G and 80% to L until the first time that the partnership has recognized items of income and gain that exceed the items of loss and deduction recognized over its life, and then all further partnership items are to be allocated equally between G and L. These rules apply to all deductions unless there is a special rule in another provision discussed below. All nonrecourse deductions will be allocated 30% to G and 70% to L. At the time the partnership agreement is entered into, there is a reasonable likelihood that, over the partnership's life, it will recognize amounts of income and gain significantly in excess of losses and deductions. The partnership agreement requires that all allocations are to be reflected in appropriate adjustments to the partners' capital accounts and liquidation proceeds are to be distributed in accordance with positive capital account balances. Only G is required to restore a capital account deficit. The partnership agreement contains a qualified income offset for L and a minimum gain chargeback provision. Finally, the agreement provides that all nonliquidating distributions will be made 20% to G and 80% to L until a total of $400,000 (equal to the partners' original cash contributions) has been distributed, and thereafter such distributions will be made equally to G and L.  The partnership depreciates its property using the straight-line method over a valid (you may assume for purposes of this question) 10-year recovery period for both tax and book purposes (so use 10 years to depreciate the property for tax and book purposes for purposes of your analysis). Assume that rental income from the property of $150,000 equals operating expenses (including interest on the nonrecourse debt) of $150,000 other than the depreciation expense on the $2 million purchased real property mentioned above . Determine the allocation of the partnership's cost recovery deductions in year three of operations and determine the partners' capital accounts at the end of year three. Show your analysis of the safe harbor rules (if applicable) in order to provide certainty to your client. Note that even though you are doing the analysis for  year 3 you will need to calculate what the effects are in Years 1 and 2 to roll over capital accounts, etc. You do not need to analyze the rules for years 1 and 2, but you should explain how you got certain calculations at the beginning of year 3 for partial credit. If there is any information missing to make sure the safe harbor is respect please make sure to note this (however, if this information is presented for you to do analysis this will be part of your grade). Note: make sure to cite all Code and Regulation references in your answer used to support your analysis (these will be part of your grade).

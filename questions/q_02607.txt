For the following questions, you will need a periodic table.  Use the one found at this link (don't worry ... Proctorio will be fine if you click this): https://www.fishersci.com/us/en/periodic-table.html   READ CAREFULLY: This question has FOUR parts (A, B, C, and D) and you will need ONE blank sheet of paper (use it wisely).     FOR PARTS A, B, AND C:  Write your answers to these parts on your black piece of paper. When you answer each part, write the letter along the left side of the paper and show your solution just under and next to that letter.  SHOW ALL YOUR WORK AS INSTRUCTED IN LABS 1 AND 2.  Also, draw a horizontal line across your piece of paper to show where your solution for each part begins and ends. For all atomic weights pulled from the periodic table, round to TWO decimal places.  For all calculations, also round your values and answers to TWO decimal places.  Make sure to circle your final answer for each part. When you finish Parts A, B, and C, take a picture of your work with your smartphone and email that image to Dr. Machado at christopher_machado@cuesta.edu.  Make the subject line: [YOUR NAME] Lab 1 Calculations        FOR PART D, TYPE YOUR ANSWER IN THE TEXT BOX BELOW IN COMPLETE SENTENCES!    Part A (6 points) Calculate the number of grams in one mole of tryptophan (C11H12N2O2).     Part B (8 points) Magnesium chloride (MgCl2) is a molecule held together by ionic bonds and completely dissociates in solution.  If you are given a MgCl2 solution that has a concentration of 2.0 g/dL, what would be the molarity of that solution?    Part C (8 points) Calculate the osmolarity (in mOsM) of the MgCl2 solution you worked with in the previous question.    Part D (8 points) If you added 5 mL of this solution to a test tube containing 1 mL of human blood and then observed the erythrocytes with a microscope, DESCRIBE what you expect to see in terms of erythrocyte appearance/structure and EXPLAIN HOW that change occurred by comparing this solution to the normal osmolarity of blood.  TYPE YOUR ANSWER IN THE TEXT BOX BELOW, USE COMPLETE SENTENCES, AND INCLUDE AS MUCH TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGY AS POSSIBLE!

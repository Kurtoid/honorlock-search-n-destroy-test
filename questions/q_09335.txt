Socrates' erstwhile teacher dropped a lot of ideas--maybe even some genuine revelations--on him. Briefly (2-3 sentences) describe one of these points made to Socrates, and how it was defended/proved by his interlocutor.
(1) (10 points) A solid pipe with a 90 degree bend is attached to a rigid wall at point A. Three forces are applied at point B: a 500 N force in the positive X-direction, a 200 N force in the negative Y-direction, and a 300 N force in the positive Z-direction.   At cross-section C, answer "yes" or "no" if the following stress occurs due to the 500 N force. Consider the entire plane, not a particular point on the plane. Clearly label your answers on your solution sheet. (a) Normal stress in the X-direction due an axial force in the X axis. __________ (b) Normal stress in the X-direction due to bending about the Y axis. __________ (c) Normal stress in the X-direction due to bending about the Z axis. __________ (d) Shear stress due to torsion around the X axis. __________ (e) Shear stress due to transverse shear force. ___________   At cross-section C, answer "yes" or "no" if the following stress occurs due to the 300 N force. Consider the entire plane, not a particular point on the plane. Clearly label your answers on your solution sheet. (f) Normal stress in the X-direction due an axial force in the X axis. __________ (g) Normal stress in the X-direction due to bending about the Y axis. __________ (h) Normal stress in the X-direction due to bending about the Z axis. __________ (i) Shear stress due to torsion around the X axis. __________ (j) Shear stress due to transverse shear force. ___________

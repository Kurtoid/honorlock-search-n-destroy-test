Students, You can access the exam questions in this PDF. Same as for the assignments, either print out the exam and then scan it (e.g., using your favorite mobile app), use iPad to write answers, or directly write the answer on PDF using your favorite tool.  You will need to upload PDF to this question before time runs out.   No upload within 200minutes of starting, no grade. The exam is open book, open notes, open lectures. BUT. It is individual work. Any communication (to anybody in or outside the class) is strictly prohibited and will be considered cheating and appropriately reported to student affairs.  As is mentioned in the first lecture and emphasized multiple times, you are NOT allowed to share exam material (with or without answers) to anybody.  This will also be reported to academic affairs. If you need any clarification questions, please ask on piazza. I obviously cannot be there 24/7 during the exam period, but will try to monitor as closely as I can.

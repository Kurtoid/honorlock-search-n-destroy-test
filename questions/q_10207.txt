Question 3: Variable Selection (3a) 4pts - Conduct a complete search to find the submodel with the smallest AIC. Fit this model. Include an intercept. Call it model2. Display the summary table for the model. Note: Remember to perform the variable selection for a Binomial/logistic regression model. (3a.1) Which variables are selected to be in model2? (3a.2) Provide a plot of the AIC for the best model of each size. Hint: Use the Subsets component of bestglm. What do you see in this plot? (3b) 3pts - Conduct forward stepwise regression using BIC. Allow the minimum model to be the model with only an intercept, and the full model to be model1. Call it model3. Display the summary table for the model. Which variables are selected to be in model3?  (3c) 7.5pts - Conduct lasso regression. Use target_5yrs as the response, and all other variables as the predicting variables. Use 10-fold cross validation on the classification error to select the optimal lambda value. (3c.1) What optimal lambda value did you obtain?(3c.2) Display the estimated coefficients at the optimal lambda value.(3c.3) How many coefficients were shrunk exactly to zero?(3c.4) Plot the paths of the lasso regression coefficients. As lambda decreases, which variable is the second variable to become non-zero/selected in the model?(3c.5) Fit a logistic regression model with target_5yrs as the response variable and the variables selected from lasso regression as predicting variables. Include an intercept. Call it model4. Display the summary table for the model. (3d) 1.5pts - Conduct a multicollinearity test on model2, model3, and model4. Using a VIF threshold of 10, have any of these variable selection approaches resulted in a model without the multicollinearity problem?

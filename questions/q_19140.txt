Researchers investigating the regulation of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic neurons proposed a model (Figure 1) in which CDK5, a protein expressed in axon terminals, inhibits the movement of synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic membrane. To test their model, the researchers used a modified version of green fluorescent protein . In slightly alkaline conditions, GFP exhibits a bright green fluorescence. In acidic conditions GFP  exhibits no fluorescence. Using standard techniques, the gene encoding GFP is easily introduced into living cells. By engineering the expression of GFP in laboratory-cultured nerve cells, the researchers found that a bright green fluorescence was exhibited only when a presynaptic neuron was given a certain stimulus. Which of the following observations best supports the hypothesis that CDK5 negatively regulates neurotransmitter release?

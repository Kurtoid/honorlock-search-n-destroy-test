VRAAG 5 'n 0,5kg blok is geheg aan 'n 0,3kg blok deur middel van 'n ligte toutjie. Die 0,3kg blok hang vertikaal soos die toutjie oor 'n wrywinglose katrol getrek is. 'n Horisontale krag van 6N werk in op die 0,5kg blok wat op die horisontale oppervlak gly, soos in die diagram hieronder aangedui. Die 0,5kg blok ondervind 'n wrywingskrag van 2N.  Regtertklik op die blou blok hieronder om die diagram in 'n nuwe "tab" oop te maak.       5.1   Stel Newton se Tweede bewegingswet.   (3)      5.2    Teken twee benoemde vryliggaam diagramme om die volgende aan te toon: Die horisontale kragte wat op die 0,5kg blok inwerk en and vertikale kragte wat op die 0,3kg blok inwerk.

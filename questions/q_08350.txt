Miller Manufacturing owns 10 machines that produce nylon thread. Machine breakdowns follow a Poisson distribution with an average of 0.01 breakdowns per operating hour per machine. Service times to repair the machines are exponentially distributed with an average of 8 hours per repair. Currently, the company employs one technician to fix these machines. The company loses $150 per hour when a machine is down and technicians are paid $15 per hour.

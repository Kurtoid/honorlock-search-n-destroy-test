One of the doctoral students at your new institution who is about to collect data is worrying about potential endogeneity in his/her SEM model. Please help the student with the following.  Please explain the sources of endogeneity in general. In addition, please identify and briefly explain various ways to mitigate the potential endogeneity issue. (10 points) One of the common approaches to endogeneity in Econometrics is to use an instrumental variable. Please explain thoroughly how an instrumental variable alleviates endogeneity in a regression model. (10 points) Finally, please explain how SEM can potentially handle various sources of endogeneity differently from OLS regression. (10 points)

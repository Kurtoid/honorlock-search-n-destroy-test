QUESTION 4         4.1   Read the case study below carefully, and then answer the questions that follow.   IS RUGBY LINKED TO MOTOR NEURON DISEASE? Many have questioned whether there is a link between rugby-linked head injuries and Motor Neuron Disease (MND) in light of cases including those of Joost van der Westhuizen, Tinus Linee, John Mudgeway, Ryan Walker and Jarrod Cunningham, all professional rugby players who have all suffered from the disease. Speaking to Radio 702's Redi Tlhabi, Dr David Anderson, a neurologist at the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre, explains although the disease is associated with recurrent head injury, the actual cause has not been found.  He did indicate, however, that  studies have shown there's a double risk of MND associated with repeated head injury. What happens when one suffers from Motor Neuron Disease? "In the majority of cases, it starts with weakness. It can start slowly and anywhere in the body. In some cases, it can start with a speech problem or a swallowing problem. It's usually very subtle and not noticed right away but eventually progresses. It can sometimes be misdiagnosed as a small stroke or an injured nerve, but the hallmark of it is there is no sensory problem.  It is purely a weakness syndrome which progresses relatively rapidly, which differentiates it from a stroke. A stroke is a sudden problem which gets better whereas Motor Neurone Disease progresses." Once you've been diagnosed, what can you do? "It's the worst diagnosis a doctor can give. We follow strict criteria, and we look for every other possible diagnosis before we accept the diagnosis of MND. You have to have all the right signs in all the right places before we give the diagnosis. Once we give the diagnosis, there is no treatment that really helps. There is one drug that may add a few months onto the patient's life but ultimately, all patients die from it. People are often in their prime when they are preparing to enjoy what they have created. They lose their independence and have to depend on other people because they are completely unable to move.

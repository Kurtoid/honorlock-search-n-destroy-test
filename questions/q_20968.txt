The kinetics data of an enzyme E  (whose concentration is maintained constant at a level of 1 mM (=10-6 M)) is shown in the table below. A double reciprocal (Lineweaver-Burk) plot was generated from this data, also shown below.   Blank #1: Determine the Vmax (include the units) for this enzyme. Blank #2: Determine the KM (include the units) for this enzyme. The experiment above was repeated twice more, once adding 10 mM of inhibitor A, and the second time adding 10 mM of inhibitor B (separately). The Lineweaver-Burk plots in the presence of these inhibitors are indicated by "+A" or "+B" in the plot below.   Blank #3: What type of inhibitor is A? Blank #4: What type of inhibitor is B? Blank #5: Which of the two curves below corresponds to inhibitor A? (1 or 2)

An animal breeder can buy four types of food for Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs.  Each case of Brand A contains 25 units of fiber, 30 units of protein, and 30 units of fat.  Each case of Brand B contains 50 units of fiber, 30 units of protein, and 20 units of fat.  Each case of Brand C contains 75 units of fiber, 30 units of protein, and 30 units of fat.  Each case of Brand D contains 150 units of fiber, 90 units of protein, and 40 units of fat.  How many cases of each should the breeder mix to obtain a food that provides 1500 units of fiber, 750 units of protein, and 600 units of fat? This system of equations can be set up as follows: 25A+50B+75C+150D=150030A+30B+30C+90D=75030A+20B+30C+40D=600{"version":"1.1","math":"25A+50B+75C+150D=150030A+30B+30C+90D=75030A+20B+30C+40D=600"} Which of the following below is the correct parametric solution?

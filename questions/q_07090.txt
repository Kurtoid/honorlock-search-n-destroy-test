13. The management of Casablanca Manufacturing Corporation believes that machine-hours is an appropriate measure of activity for overhead cost. Shown below are machine-hours and total overhead costs for the past six months:         Machine-Hours       Overhead Cost         Jan   150,000           $   339,000     Feb   140,000           $   328,000     Mar   160,000           $   350,000     Apr   130,000           $   319,500     May   170,000           $   362,500     Jun   200,000           $   400,000               Assume that the relevant range includes all of the activity levels mentioned in this problem. If Casablanca expects to incur 185,000 machine hours next month, what will the estimated total overhead cost be using the high-low method?

Gaucher disease is the most common lipid storage disease in humans. It is caused by a deficiency of an enzyme necessary for the breakdown of lipids. This leads to an accumulation of fatty material in the organs of the body including the spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs ad bone marrow.

Craig Moritz and colleagues examined how the distribution of 28 small mammal species in Yosemite National Park has changed over the past century by resurveying plots initially surveyed between 1914 and 1920 by Joseph Grinnell. Moritz and colleagues then generated curves showing the probability (0-1) of finding a given species at a particular elevation. Their research showed that ranges for 6 species expanded, ranges for 10 contracted, and 12 showed no change. The historic and current elevation probability curves for the alpine chipmunk (Tamias alpinus), bushy-tailed woodrat (Neotoma cinerea), and pinyon mouse (Peromyscus truei) are shown below.According to the graphs, which of the three species have a lower probability of being found across all elevations, compared to historic data?

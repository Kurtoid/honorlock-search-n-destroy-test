FULL SOLUTION PROBLEM:  For the following question, write down the final answers here, but you must submit a full solution including Given, Find, EQU, all mathematical steps, and include units.  Work on this problem should be submitted to Test #3 Work Submission assignment no more than 15 minutes after the completion of this test. A 3.2-kg block slides down an inclined surface from point A to point B (see the figure below). Points A and B are 5.0 m apart. The coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.25 and the block is starting at rest from point A.   Draw a labeled free body diagram for the 3.2 kg mass [1pt]. Find the work done by the friction force on the block during its motion from point A to point B [1 pt.]. Find the work done by the gravitational force on the block during its motion from point A to point B [1 pt.]. Find the total work is done on the block (W_tot) during its motion from point A to point B. [1 pts.] Find the speed of the block when it reaches point B [1 pt.].

Frank asked his company's employee benefits director if his group health coverage could be converted to individual coverage. The benefits director said, "Yes, you can convert to an individual policy, and the coverage is identical to your group coverage." Frank quit his job and converted to an individual policy.

Use the following patient vignette to answer questions 21 - 24. A 38-year old woman presents with an abrupt onset of muscle weakness.  She had a diagnosis of lupus 8-years prior to this visit and a recent viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. The patient also reports shortness of breath. Current medications include ibuprofen and low-dose corticosteroids. Temperature is normal, blood pressure is 128/85 mm Hg, pulse rate is 72/min, and respiration rate is 16/min. Oxygen saturation is 95% on ambient air. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal. Neurologic examination reveals symmetric weakness in all four extremities. Sensation to touch and pain is within normal limits.  She receives a score of 30/30 on the MoCA test of cognition. 24. Which of the following treatments for muscle weakness would be most appropriate in the above patient?

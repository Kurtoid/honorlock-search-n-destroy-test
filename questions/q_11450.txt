QUESTION 3: Probability     Answer all questions by showing clear mathematical method.      3.1   A fair ten-sided dice is rolled once.  Each face on the dice has a number from 1-10.  Give your answers to questions 3.1.1 - 3.1.4 as fractions.      3.1.1   What is the probability of the dice landing on an even number?   (1)     3.1.2   What is the probability of the dice landing on a number that is not a multiple of 4?   (1)     3.1.3   What is the probability of the dice landing on a square number?   (1)     3.1.4   What is the probability of the dice landing on 12?   (1)     3.1.5   Redraw the following number line and indicate ALL your answers from questions 3.1.1 - 3.1.4 on the number line.    (2)               3.2   The following two-way table shows different tigers in captivity in a particular country.      Bengal   Siberian   Sumatran   Total     Male   14   9   3   26     Female   17   4   13   34     Total   31   13   16   60      As part of a zoological study, the health of the tigers are being monitored.   *Hint for interpreting the table: The total column at the end shows the total for each row; the total row at the bottom shows the total for each column.  When chosen at random, work out the probability that:       3.2.1   a male tiger is chosen.   (1)     3.2.2   a Bengal tiger is chosen.   (1)     3.2.3   a female Sumatran tiger is chosen.   (1)     3.2.4   the chosen tiger is NOT Siberian.   (2)               3.3   There are ten coloured counters in a bag. The counters can be either blue, red, green or yellow.  When choosing at random the following probabilities arise: P(blue or red) = 0.7 P(not yellow) = 0.9 P(not blue) = 0.7  Determine the number of counters of each colour there are in the bag.   (3)               3.4   Muhammad places the letters of his name into a bag. M   U   H   A   M   M   A   D He selects one letter at random from the bag.

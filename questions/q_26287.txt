Consider a region where the self-sufficient wage is constant at $[w]. Suppose the payoff from innovation in a city with population n (measured in thousands) is P(n) = 2 x [a] n - [b] n^2 + [c], where "x" sign shows multiplication. Compute the (stable) equilibrium size of the innovation city. Please round to one decimal digit, e.g. 2.35 is rounded as 2.4.
Lecture Read the text and respond to the following questions.   Est-il possible de mesurer le bonheur? Jusqu'a recemment, les economistes etaient d'accord pour affirmer que le bien-etre etait strictement lie a la richesse. Un consensus existait concernant le fait que l'argent suffise (is sufficient) a notre bonheur. Le progres se mesurait donc a notre degre de consommation de biens et de services comme le logement, les loisirs et la nourriture. Mais ces conceptions ont ete quelque peu bousculees (shaken up) quand une etude de l'Insee, intitulee <<Qualite de la vie>>, a enfin ete publiee. Ses resultats montraient que les Francais evaluaient leur sentiment de bien-etre a environ 6,8 sur une echelle (scale) de 0 a 10. Ils montraient aussi que le revenu n'etait plus le seul critere important dans cette evaluation, mais que la qualite de vie jouait autant voire peut-etre plus. Des elements comme la sante, le logement, les relations sociales ou le stress, qui influent sur la perception des individus quant a leurs conditions materielles et sociales, seraient donc capables d'expliquer le bien-etre mieux que les revenus seuls. Le Bhoutan, ce petit pays au nord de l'Inde, a depuis des annees deja remplace la mesure du PIB, produit interieur brut (gross domestic product), par celle du BNB, <<bonheur national brut>>. On peut se demander si, apres ces decouvertes, la France ne va pas vouloir l'imiter. Nous n'y sommes pas encore! Quels sont les elements mentionnes dans cette etude qui expliquent mieux les conditions du bien-etre que le salaire?

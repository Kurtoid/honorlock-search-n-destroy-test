You have created a GFP fusion to a protein that is normally secreted from yeast cells. Because you have learned about the use of temperature-sensitive mutations in yeast to study protein and vesicle transport, you obtain three mutant yeast strains, each defective in some aspect of the protein secretory process. Being a good scientist, you of course also obtain a wild-type control strain. You decide to examine the fate of your GFP fusion protein in these various yeast strains and engineer the mutant strains to express your GFP fusion protein. However, in your excitement to do the experiment, you realize that you did not label any of the mutant yeast strains and no longer know which strain is defective in what process. You end up numbering your strains with the numbers 1 to 4, and then you carry out the experiment anyway, obtaining the results shown in Figure Q15-46 (the black dots represent your GFP fusion protein).      Figure Q15-46 Name the process that is defective in each of these strains. Remember that one of these strains is your wild-type control.

This problem is worth 30 points, 15 points for Question 1 analysis/answer and 15 points for Question 2 analysis/answer. G and L form a limited partnership.  G, the general partner, contributes $10,000 and L, the limited partner, contributes $90,000. The partnership purchases a building on leased land, paying $ 1 million total as follows: $100,000 cash (from G and L's contributions) and borrowing $900,000 on a nonrecourse basis from a commercial lender (securing the loan with a mortgage on the building).  Therefore, the total cost of the building is $1 million (again the land is leased, so it is not purchased). The terms of the loan require the payment of market rate interest and no principal for the first ten years. Assume for convenience that the building is depreciable at the rate of $50,000 per year for twenty years. The partnership's gross income exactly equals its deductible cash flow expenses with the exception of depreciation for the first three years of the business (so each year the partnership reports a loss of $50,000 attributable to depreciation deductions). The partnership agreement contains a qualified income offset, and G is required to make up any capital account deficit. Further, all other items are in the agreement to meet substantial economic effect and the requirements for nonrecourse deductions be respected. The agreement further specifies there are three ways of allocation:  Except as otherwise required by a minimum gain chargeback provision, the agreement allocates profit and loss 50% to G and 50% to L until such time as the partnership recognizes items of income and gain that exceed the items of deduction and loss that it has recognized over its life. Subsequent partnership income and losses once a loss situation has been reversed and income occurs are allocated 10% to G and 90% to L (assume that it is reasonably anticipated that the allocation will change after ten years). All nonrecourse deductions will be allocated 10% to G and 90% to L.  Question 1 (15 points): At the end of year 1 how is the $900,000 of liability allocated and what is the outside basis of G and L's ownership interests (after considering the depreciation deducted).  Question 2 (15 points): At the end of year 3 how is the $900,000 of liability allocated and what is the outside basis of G and L's ownership interests (after considering the depreciation deducted).

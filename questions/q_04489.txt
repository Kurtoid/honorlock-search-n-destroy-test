How does Karen Redfield employ a "culturally responsive pedagogy" with respect to her Native American students? Also, show how the Neighborhood Academic Initiative (NAI), an educational intervention program that serves primarily low-income urban minority youths in 7th through 12th grade, indeed views "students' families and neighborhoods . . . as critical agents for creating the conditions for [educational] success." Discuss how BOTH the NAI program AND parents from the Mayo and Siraj study (i.e., parents in the group of 20 families whose children were "succeeding academically above prediction") develop the "embodied academic capital" and "habitus" that is critical for success in college. Finally, discuss YOUR perspective on how parental involvement in their child's/student's education and early "head start" programs can develop the knowledge and drive for young students to achieve academically.

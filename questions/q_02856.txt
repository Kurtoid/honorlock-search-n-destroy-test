The exact position of the equilibrium between ketones/aldehydes and their hydrates depends on the structure of the carbonyl compound.  Although the equilibrium favors the carbonyl compound in most cases, cyclopropanone forms a stable hydrate.  Explain this phenomenon based on the structures of cyclopropanone and its hydrate.

Directions: Complete the following sentence by doing two things:  Indicate which infinitive makes sense based on the context: avoir or etre. Don't worry about the accent on etre.

Questions 14-21 refer to a toy car which can move to the right or left along a horizontal line (the positive part of the distance axis).  Assume that friction is so small that it can be ignored. A force is applied to the car. Choose the one force graph (A through H) for the statement below which could allow the described motion of the car to continue. You may use a choice more than once or not at all. If you think that none is correct, answer choice J.  Question 16: The car moves toward the right and is speeding up at a steady rate (constant acceleration).

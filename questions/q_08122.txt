I understand that once I begin the quiz, I CANNOT have a cell phone, tablet, second computer,  etc. in my work area. (You MAY have printed notes.) I MUST show my desk AND do a 360-degree room scan with the camera on my computer to prove that I do not have a secondary electronic device on my desk. If you have not already done so, show the camera your desk area AND do a 360-degree room scan. Note: if you do not do a 360-degree scan, you WILL be penalized. Anything less than 360 degrees leaves the possibility that you have another device sitting in the area you did not show and I HAVE seen students attempt to get away with this.  Violation of any of the above will result in a minimum 20 point penalty, up to forfeiture of ALL points earned.

SECTION C QUESTION 4     Read the paragraph and study the diagram about biotechnology used in insulin production below to answer the questions that follow.    In the 1970s people suffering from diabetes mellitus used insulin from cattle or pigs, but this was expensive and time consuming. Moreover, insulin from other animals was not exactly the same as those in humans, causing many side-effects. Also, many people were against the use of animal insulin for ethical or religious reasons. This problem had to be solved and in the 1970s biotechnological companies began working on genetically modifying a bacterium to produce insulin by the insertion of a human gene. Many different methods were tried & tested, then finally in the early 1980's they succeeded. This was a great achievement in the science world. The process that is currently used to mass produce insulin today, is shown in the diagram below.   Adapted from: Insulin Production From Genetically Modified Bacteria Biology Essay (2021).

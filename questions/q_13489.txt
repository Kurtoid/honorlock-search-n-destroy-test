Which of the following is true regarding the relation between prejudice and -isms (e.g., racism, sexism, ageism)?
A hardware store uses a new sign that lights up a shape depending on the binary sequence received in 2 inputs. The first to light up is a hammer shape which requires 10, next to light up is a drill shape which requires 11,  next to light up is a screwdriver shape which requires 01, and last to light up is a lightbulb shape which requires 00, and then it starts back to the first shape. The amount of time the shape stays on and off is the same. The time to switch from one shape to another is fixed and constant.  Implement digital circuit design for the control unit for this sign so that the sign shows the shapes from hammer to drill to screwdriver to lightbulb before it starts repeating in that order. Additionally, it must be implemented using SR-flipflops, and your answer must include:   The state graph (be detailed and contain all proper directions, labels, and values) The truth tables (needs to include the truth table for the next state and truth table for the logic for the flip flops) The K-maps for the next state equation and the K-maps for the logic gates connected to the flipflops Determine the optimal SoP next state equations and the optimal SoP equations for the logic gate(s) connected to the flipflops Lastly, draw the digital circuit of the control unit all the way to the outputs that will be connected to the sign

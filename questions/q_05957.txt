The human gene encoding calcitonin contains six exons and five introns and is located on chromosome 11. The pre-mRNA transcript from this gene can generate either calcitonin or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in a tissue-specific manner. Calcitonin produced from the thyroid gland is 32 amino acids long and functions to regulate the calcium while CGRP, which contains 37 amino acids, is produced by the brain cells and involved in transmission of pain. Which of the following processes makes production of two functionally and structurally different proteins from the same gene possible?

Isolated system with non-conservative forces acting - Energy Consideration Your little sister plays with a toy boat on an inclined plane of angle th = 30*. The bottom end of this inclined plane there is a spring with a spring constant of k = 500.0 N/m fastened securely at the bottom so that the spring is parallel to the surface as shown in the figure below. Her 2.5 kg toy boat is placed on the plane a distance d = 0.4 m from the spring. From this position, her toy boat is projected towards the spring with a speed v = 0.75 m/s. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the toy boat and the plane is uk = 0.4, by what distance is the spring compressed when the toy boat momentarily comes to rest?

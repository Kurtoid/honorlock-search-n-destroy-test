When she stopped at a red light, she unbuckled her seat belt in order to take her coat off. A police officer happened to notice that Amanda was not wearing her seat belt and pulled her over. Amanda was very upset when the officer charged her, under section 106(2) of the Highway Traffic Act, for not wearing her seatbelt. The officer assured her that it was a minor offence with no possibility of jail time. When she told the officer that she was terrified about going to court, he told her that she could just pay the fine instead of going to court.    If the officer didn't charge her on that date, what would be the last possible day for service of an offence notice on Amanda?
To be scored "true" the statement must be true in its entirety.  If any part of a statement is false, then the entire answer should be scored "false." Q#13.  The 2.1.3.3. dental formula of 33 million-year-old Aegyptopithecus (from the Fayum site in Egypt) shows that this fossil primate is an early catarrhine with just two premolars.  This means Aegyptopithecus is too derived to be an ancestor of New World monkeys (which always have 3 premolars).  However it could be an ancestor (or the close cousin of the ancestor) of all modern Old World monkeys, apes and humans which also have the 2.1.2.3 dental formula.

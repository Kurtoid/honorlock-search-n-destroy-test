A 72-year-old man complains of right hip and thigh pain of 9 months' duration. On physical exam, he has reduced range of motion in both hips, but there is no tenderness or swelling on palpation. Radiographs of his pelvis and right leg show sclerotic, thickened cortical bone with a narrowed joint space near his acetabulum. Lab studies show a serum alkaline phosphatase level of 173 U/L, calcium of 9.5 mg/dL, and phosphorus of 3.4 mg/dL. The figure shows the representative microscopic appearance of his pelvic bone. Which of the following conditions is most likely to produce these findings?     A  Degenerative osteoarthritis    B  Hyperparathyroidism    C  Osteochondroma    D  Paget disease of bone    E  Vitamin D deficiency

(1) (8 points) Each answer is worth two points. Clearly write and label your answers on your paper. (a) True or False. If a beam cross-section is in a state of pure bending, the internal shear force V(x) on that cross-section will be zero. ______________ (b) True or False. The section modulus of a beam is a single parameter that describes the geometry of the beam cross-section. _____________ (c) When computing maximum stresses in a steel reinforced concrete beam, it is assumed that the concrete has _____________ (large, small, zero) strength in tension. (d) Consider a composite beam made of materials 1 and 2 subjected to a positive internal bending moment. The graph below shows the distribution of the _________________ (Young's modulus, elastic stiffness, normal stress, normal strain) within the cross-section.

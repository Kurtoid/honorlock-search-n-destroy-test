Next she prepares the salad dressing by adding some dried herbs, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil to a cruet. She shakes the dressing until an emulsion forms. For the salad Kaitlyn grates rainbow-colored carrots, slices some bright-red tomatoes and washes some green, leafy lettuce.

In the figure above, a solid disk of moment of inertia Id=0.0100 kg*m2 and radius R=10.0 cm, is rotating at 210 rev/min on a frictionless shaft. A hoop of moment of inertia Ih, inner radius R2=6.00 cm and outer radius R1=8.00 cm is initially at rest. It drops freely down onto the disk, and frictional forces bring the hoop and the disk to a common rotational speed of 70.0 rev/min.  a) (6p) What is the moment of inertia of the hoop, Ih? Show work by typing in, no credit will be given otherwise. b)(2p) What is the mass of the hoop?

For your final examination, you should write a cohesive, well-developed essay that fully addresses the essay prompt. Please closely read the following CQ Researcher articles (published December 6, 2013 (volume 23, issue 43)) and then the prompt below.     "Humanities Education-Should Graduates' Earnings Guide Evaluations of Colleges: Pro"by Mark Schneider, President of College Measures   "Humanities Education-Should Graduates' Earnings Guide Evaluations of Colleges: Con"by Patricia McGuire, President of Trinity Washington University     par. 1Imagine you walk into a car showroom where the sticker on every car window says, "Expected mileage 24.6 mpg." When you ask the salesperson about the mileage of the model you're shopping for, the response is, "Well, 24.6 is the national average for all cars. That's all I can tell you." Obviously, that wouldn't be an acceptable answer. Yet, that's the situation we face with regard to one of the most important outcomes of a postsecondary degree: student earnings after degree completion. par. 2Right now, we know that students with an associate degree earn more on average than those with a high school diploma, and students with a bachelor's degree earn more on average than those with an associate degree. But there is only spotty information about earning variations across schools, degrees and programs of study. There is wide variation, however. The title of my report, "Higher Education Pays: But a Lot More for Some Graduates than Others," telegraphs this important fact, based on data from several states. par. 3The report consistently found that students with liberal arts degrees usually fare poorly in the job market. At the bachelor's level, Arkansas graduates with a degree in music performance were the lowest paid graduates in the state ($19,800 vs. $32,800 for all graduates). In Tennessee, this distinction went to photography majors (average pay $28,700 vs. $37,600 for all graduates). In Virginia, philosophy majors earned just over $20,000, compared to $33,100 for all graduates. In contrast, students with technical degrees, especially engineering, top the salary scale. The poor pay performance of liberal arts graduates also is found at the master's degree level. par. 4The United States supports a great diversity of higher education institutions, with different prices and different rates of return on the money and time students invest in degrees. And, right now most students are told that higher education is a good investment--and on average it is. However, the rates of return for degrees, schools and majors vary widely. Unfortunately, this information is not easily available to students, their families or the legislators who vote to support higher education with billions of dollars every year. par. 5Just as consumers wouldn't buy a car without knowing the mileage of the models they're considering, the nation shouldn't accept not knowing the returns on the investments that students, families and taxpayers make in higher education.   par. 1Common Cause founder John W. Gardner wrote that we must beware of exalting philosophers while scorning plumbers. Otherwise, we risk having a society where "neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water." In 1968, Gardner was worried about the plumbers. But today, the plumbers are doing all right. It's the philosophers we need to worry about. par. 2The White House recently proposed a rating system for higher education that will include institutional data on the salaries of recent graduates. Already, data-mining entrepreneurs are producing lists that prompt scary headlines about majors such as "Worst College Majors for Your Career" and "5 best and worst schools for ROI" [return on investment]. par. 3None of this is news. Since the days when Socrates gave free lectures under a tree, we've known that philosophy doesn't pay much, but it seems fairly essential to a coherent, good society. We also know that engineering, also essential for constructing the tangible infrastructure of that good society, can be very lucrative. par. 4But somebody has to provide counseling to all those rich engineers, teach their children, curate the museums they enjoy, write their novels, maintain the civic life of their communities and, yes, construct theories about inequality. Such occupations are not less worthy simply because they pay less. par. 5Data on the salaries of alumni inform the college-choice process for prospective students. If our institutions are as good as we claim, we should be proud to report outcomes like the percentage of employed graduates, types of careers, and, yes, average salary ranges for alumni across experience levels. par. 6But there's a massive difference between the fair reporting of salary outcomes versus rating institutions (or majors) based on a rank-order of the specific salary values of the jobs held by our graduates. Ranking salaries disparages many occupations while exalting a few in a way that betrays society's need to have well-educated professionals across a full range of careers.     _____________________________________________________________________________________ Topic: Using the above-noted articles, "Humanities Education-Should Graduates' Earnings Guide Evaluations of Colleges: Pro" and "Humanities Education-Should Graduates' Earnings Guide Evaluations of Colleges: Con," as reference sources, write an essay in which you analyze each author's use of one rhetorical tool or rhetorical appeal to achieve his or her specific purpose.

This problem is worth 19 points. It will be transferred to Gradescope for grading so make sure not to use any formatting in your solution. A double-knot is a graph on an even number of vertices, say 2g, in which there are 2 disjoint cliques of size g with exactly one edge between the 2 cliques.  Note, there is exactly 1 edge between the 2 cliques, if there are more than 1 than it is not a double-knot. Consider the Double-Knot (DK) problem: Input: An undirected graph G=(V,E) and an integer goal g.Output: Subsets S and T of vertices where the graph on S+T (i.e., the union of S and T) is a double-knot with 2g vertices, or report NO if no double-knot of 2g vertices exists in G. Note,  S+T being a double-knot means that , the set S is a clique on g vertices, T is also a clique on g vertices and there is exactly one edge in G connecting S and T.Prove that the Double-Knot (DK) problem is NP-complete.

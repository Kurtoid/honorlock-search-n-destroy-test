How many hours do you study in a typical week in college?  A recent survey asked a random sample of 25 college students this question.  The sample mean was 11.20 hours with a standard deviation of 7.31 hours.  A boxplot of the data is given below.     a. Is it reasonable to use t procedures to construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean hours college students study in a typical week? [reasonable]   b. Calculate the 95% confidence interval. [CI]   c. Given the following two statements:  The sample mean hours college students spend studying in a typical week is unlikely to be exactly equal to the population mean. A 90% confidence interval calculated on the same set of data will be narrower than the 95% confidence interval.  Which of the statements are true? [true]   Minitab output for a 99% confidence interval is given below.   For each of the following interpretations, decide if they are correct or incorrect. d. We are 99% confident that the interval 7.11 hours to 15.29 hours captures the true mean hours college students spend studying in a typical week. [correct]   e.

a03_exam_bu_data.accdb John Miller owns a lawn service and tracks all charges for mowing, landscaping, tree trimming, and other services in a database. Some customers are eligible for discounts. You have been asked to create a new table that tracks customer payments and to create queries that will help John with decision making.  In tblPayments, make the following changes to the field properties: For the field PmtID, add a custom format to display PMT before the ID number and make it the primary key with new values in sequential incremental order. For the CustID, create a Lookup field using the tblCustomers table, including the fields CustID, CustLastName, and CustFirstName. Sort in Ascending order by CustID and hide the key column. Add Customer as the caption. For the PmtMethod field,create a lookup field that lists the following values: Cash, Check,MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Discover. Limit the user's selection to what is on the list. Add the caption Method.     Enter the following data in tblPayments:     CustID ScheduleID PmtAmount PmtDate PmtMethod   Anderson 5 $225 3/3/2018 American Express   Saunders 6 $75 5/20/2018 Visa   Wong 7 $950 5/5/2018 MasterCard   Mead 8 $175 4/30/2018 Visa   Fowler 10 $85 4/12/2018 Visa   Sanders 11 $75 3/13/2018 Visa       Create a one-to-many relationship between ScheduleID in tblScheduleand the ScheduleID in tblPayments and enforce referential integrity.     Create a query that calculates any customer discounts on each service. Display CustFirstName, CustLastName, ScheduleID,ServiceDate, DiscountType, a field to display the discount amount named DiscountAmt, and a field that displays the actual amount due named AmtDue in the query. The LawnMember discount is 10%. The Referral discount is 25%. The Contract discount is 20%. Only display services that receive a discount. Save the query as qryDiscounts.     Create a query that finds all services scheduled between 4/1/2018 and 5/31/2018. The query results should display ScheduleID, ServiceDate, PmtAmount, PmtDate, and PmtMethod. Show only the customers who paid with Visa. Sort in Ascending order by PmtAmount. Save the query as qryVisaDates     Create a Top Values query that displays the 10 highest service rates being charged to customers. The query results should display CustFirstName and CustLastName and ChargeAmount. Save the query as qryTopValues

Part III:  Using Citations in Context (2 points per question = 34 points) Instructions for questions 15 - 31: A colleague has asked you to review her use of legal citations in the first three pages of the argument section of a brief she will be submitting to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Someone else already checked the citation format, and everything is correct. Your job is to flag any errors in the author's use of citations in context--the kinds of mistakes that can be recognized only by viewing the citations in relation to the rest of the work, like an incorrect use of short form or a disconnect between the proposition and the authority cited.  You can assume the following:  The legal authorities have not previously been cited in this document. Everything in this excerpt would be considered part of "the same general discussion" under Bluepages B10.2.  Each sentence (including its accompanying citations) is numbered. For each sentence, identify a correction that should be made--or indicate that there is "No error"--by selecting a response from choices A through F below. The answer choices A through F are identical for every question in this section.     Add or remove citation (because the sentence needs support or includes an unnecessary citation).  Cite to different authority (because the authority cited does not support the proposition).  Add or remove a signal or explanatory parenthetical.  Add or remove a pinpoint citation.   Fix an error related to full or short form.  No error.    The question number is at the beginning of each sentence. Your answer choices appear in a dropdown menu between the question number and the sentence you are evaluating. The color of each sentence alternates between blue and red to help you differentiate one question from the next.

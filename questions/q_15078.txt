I give you plenty of opportunities to redeem bad grades. It is better to fail this test than to get expelled. You're an Osprey, so act like one.

KEEP YOUR FACE VISIBLE TO THE CAMERA AT ALL TIMES and make sure eyes stay on the exam.  Failure to follow these rules will result in your exam being flagged and me having to watch it (I don't want to).

Short Answer Question. Suppose that you are assigned a slightly different datapath than MIPS datapath, but based on what you have studied in Computer Architecture class, you are supposed to be able to figure it out. This is a new datapath to deal with floating point number (FP) system. The pipeline contains stages: IF, IS (Issue), RO (Read operand), EXE and WB(Write). Each stage except EXE requires one clock cycle.  Pipeline has forwarding hardware for all FUs, except FP-Load / Store where operand is ready after W-stage. This datapath contains 4 floating point units (FUs) for FP operations, FP-addition / subtraction, FP-load / store, and FP-multiplication and FP-division:  EXE-stage for Load / Store operations contains 1 clock cycle (EXE); EXE-stage for Add or Sub operations contains 1 clock cycle (A or S); EXE-stage for MULTD operation contains 3 clock cycles (M1, M2, M3); EXE-stage for DIVD operation contains 4 clock cycles (D1, D2, D3, D4); Timing diagram with clock cycles is following:    Please answer the following questions. 1. Please specify what kind of hazards are between following instructions ? (1). between MULTD S1, S3, S5 and sw S9, 50(R2). (2). between DIVD S0, S1, S7 and add S7, S9, S3.   2. Please specify what kind of data hazards are between the following instructions (recall, as you are taught in the lecture, data hazards include RAW, WAR, WAW, WAR, or None)? (3).between MULTD S1, S3, S5 and sw S9, 50(R2). (4). between DIVD S0, S1, S7 and add S7, S9, S3. (5). between MULTD S1, S3, S5 and DIVD S0, S1, S7.

Gunther wins a $25,000 judgment against Krissa, and Krissa refuses to pay. Krissa works for Iniversal Electronics. Gunther obtains a postjudgment writ of garnishment from the court ordering Iniversal Electronics to pay 25 percent of Krissa's weekly disposable earnings directly to Gunther. However, Gunther is not satisfied with this, and he asks the court to increase Krissa's pay deduction to 50 percent, which the court refuses to do. Which federal Act allows Krissa to retain 75 percent or more of her earnings in a writ of garnishment?

A patient comes to the hospital, stating that he "feels sick".  You perform a blood test that reveals an elevated white blood cell count.  The reports show the following white blood cell percentages: Basophils:                     1% Eosinophils:                  4% Neutrophils:                 52% Lymphocytes:              40% Monocytes:                  3% Based on these counts, which of the following most logically explains the patients complaint of feeling sick?
EssayRecommended time: 15 minutesChoose ONE of the following questions and write an essay in which you incorporate materials from lecture and course readings, as they apply. Before writing, you may want to pause to outline the major points of your essay. You may choose any work from class or the reading, whether it was on the Midterm Exam Slides image board or not. Try to select slides that you have not yet discussed in the other questions.     Much of the art we have seen in this course served a religious function to transition the dead to the afterlife, to model aspects of the cosmos, and/or to connect worshippers with their gods. Choose TWO works of art or architecture. Focusing on those examples, describe how they were shaped to serve this function.   How do rulers and/or societies use art and/or architecture for "political messaging"--to communicate their ideals, accomplishments, and place in the cosmic order? Select TWO examples to answer the question. You may discuss examples that relate to a single ruler or society (for example Hatshepsut, Athens) or examples that relate to two different rulers/societies. For example, you could discuss two aspects of the Parthenon or compare the Parthenon to something else.

1) Your research project involves a set of three Arabidopsis genes, which TAIR lists as 'unknown function'. Two of these (ABC1 and ABC2) are 90% identical at the protein level, while the third (ABC3) is 40% identical to the other two at the DNA level and has 65% protein identity. You obtain homozygous t-DNA knockout single mutants for abc1 and abc2, and they look the same as wild-type under all conditions that you grow the plants. Suggest a hypothesis for the lack of a mutant phenotype (5 points) 2) Given the response to the last question, you decide to try other approaches to finding a whole plant phenotype associated with altered expression of each member of this gene family. What functional genomic approaches that do not involve t-DNA or transposon mutants would you choose? Indicate whether the approach allows you to distinguish a specific function for each gene (5 points) 3) Can you hypothesize to which cell organelle ABC1, 2 and 3 proteins are targeted? IF yes, describe how you would test your hypothesis? Describe the anticipated results if your hypothesis is correct (5 points) 4) The centromere of eukaryotic chromosomes is essential for the faithful segregation and inheritance of genetic information. It contains highly repetitive DNA. They identified a repetitive sequence called pAL1 satellite repeat in Arabidopsis genome. Describe a cytological method to understand the distribution and copy number variation of the pAL1 satellite repeat in Arabidopsis centromeres (5 points)

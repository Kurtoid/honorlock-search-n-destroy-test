The general manager of a fast food restaurant contracted with an equipment supplier on behalf of the restaurant for the installation of a new custom-fit countertop griddle. The written contract included the following provisions: "After successful installation of the griddle, the restaurant will pay the supplier $10,000. Installation must be completed by July 1." Installation of the new griddle was completed on July 18. The employees of the restaurant immediately began using the new griddle and were impressed by its efficiency. The equipment supplier sent its bill to the manager of the restaurant, stating that the new griddle was in place and operating as promised, and demanding the $10,000 payment. The manager refused to make any payment, noting in her reply letter that the system had not been installed by July 1, as promised. If the equipment supplier is found to be in breach because of the late installation of the griddle, may it successfully bring an action to recover the reasonable value of its services?

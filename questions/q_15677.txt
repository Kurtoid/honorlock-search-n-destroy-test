Multiaxial System Labeling (10 points) - Write your answers directly on this examination form.  Please read the following case description of Libby.  Label Libby's correct diagnosis in the space below (just simply label the disorder - no need to list any symptoms). Then, explain how Dr. Fixit might conceptualize the causes of Libby's disorder from both the BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL and the DIATHESIS-STRESS MODEL (again, using specific information provided in the case - do not speculate!). Be sure to use specific examples from the case to support each part of the model. Please note that there is more information included in this case than you will use for your answers. There is more than 1 correct way to provide examples for each model; however, please do not use the same information for both models.   --- Libby is a 23-year old female who began seeing Dr. Fixit last month for psychotherapy following the end of a 2-year romantic relationship.  Libby reported feeling excessively sad and had no appetite, no motivation, and had lost pleasure in activities she used to enjoy.  She has had these symptoms for the past 2 months, since her relationship ended. Libby also reported having thoughts of suicide.  Libby stated that she had felt like this a few times in her life before, but this was the worst.  Libby also mentioned that she had experienced two instances in her life in which she felt energetic, had little need for sleep, and experienced inflated self-esteem.  During one of these times, Libby got in trouble for stealing a car because she wanted to take a joy ride in the middle of the night.  During the other time, she believed she could fly and was preparing to jump off a cliff. These symptoms lasted for 1-2 weeks each time.   Dr. Fixit asked Libby to tell him about her family background. She stated that her mother has a mood disorder diagnosis (though Libby wasn't quite sure which one). She also mentioned that she was physically abused as a very young child by one of her neighbors. Libby reported that she thinks she otherwise had a pretty typical childhood and has a good relationship with her parents, though her mother's mood disorder at times affected her home life and her mother's ability to effectively parent. Libby enrolled in college after she finished high school, but dropped out after the first semester. At that time, she had no job and no place to live, since she could not continue living in the dorms and her parents wouldn't let her move back in. It was around this time that Libby experienced her first symptoms of a mood disorder. Dr. Fixit recommended that Libby receive psychotherapy, and provided her with a referral for psychiatric medication, as he suspects that Libby has some neurotransmitter deficits/abnormalities.

Amazon.com     From the start, Amazon.com has been in a hurry to be a success. According to company founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Jeff Bezos, "Our initial strategy was very focused and very unidimensional. It was GBF: Get big fast. We put that on our shirts at the company picnic."     With billions to spend from its initial stock offering (Amazon's stock quickly rose to over $100 per share), Amazon spent $400 million to build eight high-tech warehouses across the country. Why spend that much for warehouses? In theory, each was capable of shipping 60 million items per year, and Amazon needed to control the entire buying transaction, beginning with online ordering, proceeding to quick warehouse handling and boxing, and ending with timely shipping and delivery. And, believing that their growth would parallel its own, Amazon then spent $350 million to buy large shares of two Internet retailers, Kozmo.com and Pets.com. Kozmo.com promised the ability to deliver thousands of items from gourmet foods to CDs and movies to customers' homes in 11 major cities within one hour after an order was placed. Pets.com was supposed to grow because Americans spend over $30 billion a year on their pets, but the pet industry was still comprised largely of small family-owned stores and was not yet dominated by a "big box" retailer like Home Depot.     Unfortunately, Amazon grew so fast that it soon lost control of the basics. Despite the billions it had raised, Amazon burned money so quickly that it had to issue bonds to raise another $2.2 billion to keep the company running. Still, it had only enough business and cash to run six of those new warehouses. Consequently, the company took a $400 million loss to close two of the warehouses and lay off 1,500 people. Furthermore, the six remaining warehouses were poorly run. Defective products which should have been returned to manufacturers sat on the shelves wasting space. Mystery orders, like a truckload of unordered kitchen knives, kept showing up. Instead of declining the deliveries, workers put whole truckloads of unordered items on the shelves. Amazon's frustrated chief of operations said, "We kept it all--we just kept it. We put it on the shelf and said, 'I don't know.' " In fact, Amazon had so much unsold inventory in its warehouses that CEO Bezos sent out an email with a point-blank message, "Get the crap out." Finally, Amazon's $350 million investment in Kozmo.com and Pets.com evaporated when both filed for bankruptcy.     Amazon's problem was not its sales, which were growing exponentially, but poor management. As a result, its stock, once valued at over $100 per share, dropped to a low of $6. As for profits, founder Bezos cautioned patience, saying, "Look at USA Today; it took 11 years to become profitable." However, Amazon has lost over $3 billion since its inception. Although the company has finally earned its first profits, that profit amounted to only $5 million on $1.12 billion in sales in its fourth quarter (October to December), and Amazon still lost $45 million for the year. Furthermore, it still has long-term debt of $2.2 billion to pay off at the rate of $120 million per year. Results like these would have cost any other CEO his or her job. If Amazon is ultimately to survive and be profitable, what does it need to do to become a more efficiently run company?Refer to Amazon.com. CEO Jeff Bezos must wrestle with basic management issues such as how to get more done at Amazon with a minimum of effort, expense, or waste. In other words, Bezos must make Amazon more:

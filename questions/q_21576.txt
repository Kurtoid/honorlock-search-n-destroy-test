Treatment choices Please choose ONE of the five questions below. Remember to choose an area of treatment that is a different area from the area you chose for assessment in this morning's exam.   Queston 1) Speech Treatment Please describe how you would provide speech treatment for Laura, an 8-year-old girl who presents with velar fronting, as well as final consonant deletion.  She is fluent in English and Spanish and moved to the US from Ecuador when she was 4 years old.  Her phonological processes are evident in both of her languages.  She speaks Spanish at home and has been in English-speaking schools since pre-school.  Please describe one of the first activities (in detail) that you would perform with her in treatment and a general overview (in one or two sentences) of what you would work on for the next few months.   Question 2) Voice Treatment Your patient has a 3-month history of left vocal fold paralysis and muscle tension dysphonia following a severe viral infection. The vocal fold is noted to be immobile in the paramedian position. The patient presents with a reduced loudness, increased pitch, and a breathy, asthenic, and strained vocal quality. Upon palpation, the patient also presents with notable tension and tenderness in the base of tongue/suprahyoid region and the thyrohyoid space.   You suspect the muscle tension dysphonia is a compensation in response to the vocal fold paralysis. You decide to refer your patient to an ENT, for consideration of medical/surgical intervention. The ENT is a close colleague of yours, and you know that, in cases such as this, she will first perform a less-invasive medical procedure. If that procedure is successful, she will consider a more permanent corrective surgery. a. What is a medical/non-surgical approach to restoring voice function that is indicated for this patient? Briefly describe this procedure.b. Assuming that all goes well, what is a permanent, surgical approach to restoring voice function in this patient? Briefly describe this procedure.  Is there a role for behavioral voice therapy prior to the permanent vocal surgery? Provide justification for your response.  Is there a role for behavioral voice therapy after to the permanent vocal surgery? Provide justification for your response.     Question 3) Dysphagia Treatment The patient is a 90-year old female with a history of Alzheimer's disease, resulting in profound dysphagia and compromised swallowing safety and efficiency.  She has had repeated pneumonias in the last two years, and reports eating and drinking to be very uncomfortable because of the frequent coughing fits and sensation of foods sticking.  There is medical concern that she has less than 6 months to live.  The patient has expressed interest in continuing to eat.  You perform a clinical evaluation of swallowing with the patient, in the presence of the patient's primary caregivers.  Bolus trials reveal considerable effort and coughing, though when trialing smaller sips with chin tuck, coughing is eliminated and the patient appears more comfortable.      What is the role of the SLP intervention for palliative care?   Would you recommend exercise-based (restorative) interventions? If so, what?  Justify your answer. Would you recommend a compensatory intervention? If so, what?  Justify your answer. Provide one reason why you would not recommend an instrumental assessment of swallowing for this patient.     The caregivers want to know if getting a feeding tube placed will increase the life expectancy for this patient.  Answer their question, and also, provide one "benefit" and one "drawback" with feeding tubes in the patient of palliative care.   Question 4) Cleft Palate Treatment Lisa, a 7-year-old girl, had her cleft palate repaired when she was 12 months old.  In your evaluation you found that she has nasal emissions for fricatives, affricates, and alveolar stops.  You noticed that her placement for /d/ is more like a /j/ (as in judge) and you learned in the assessment that she is stimulable for better, but not fully correct, placement of the /d/.    What sound are you likely to work on first, and why? What is the step-by-step plan for her treatment? Lisa is a bilingual speaker of Mandarin and English.  Her language skills are age appropriate and she is reportedly doing well academically.  In the home the family speaks Mandarin.  Lisa is fully fluent in both Mandarin and English, as is her father.  Her mother is essentially a monolingual Mandarin speaker.  It is likely that her mom will be working with her in the home, but her father is very engaged and both parents come to all sessions.  How will you determine in what language(s) she should receive treatment?    Question 5) Literacy Treatment You are an SLP working in a public school and are conducting a phonological awareness intervention with children in a kindergarten classroom.  Define what phonological and phonemic awareness are. Discuss the general developmental progression that you would follow when providing the intervention. Discuss 4 - 5 key aspects of an effective phonological awareness instruction.

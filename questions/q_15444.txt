QUESTION 5 - 5 Points This question is based on the same fact pattern as Question 3 above.  Francis leased computer equipment from Central Computer Supplies.  Central and Francis had entered into a 5 year lease for the equipment.  At the time of Francis' sale of her accounting business to Ed, there was still 2 years left on the lease.  During negotiations over the sale of the accounting business, Ed informed Francis that he wanted to take an assignment of the lease with Central because the lease payments identified in the lease was far below what Ed would have to pay to any other company to lease the equipment.  Francis agreed to assign the lease to Ed, but only if Ed agreed to be responsible for all amounts due under the lease with Central.  Ed agreed in the sale agreement with Francis that he would be "solely responsible for all amounts due under the lease with Central."  Francis did not discuss this assignment with Central because she thought they would refuse to permit the assignment.  The lease included the following provision:  "Francis shall not assign this Lease in whole or in part without the express written consent of Central."   Ed and Francis completed their sale transaction and Ed began operating the accounting practice.  Within three months Ed failed to pay the monthly lease payment to Central.  Central has provided notice that it was terminating the lease and has now sued Ed and Francis for lease payments.   In response to Central's claim against Francis for amounts due under the lease, Francis has asserted that she is no longer liable under the lease because the lease was assigned to Ed, Ed is solely responsible for operating the accounting practice, and the lease payment was Ed's sole responsibility.  Francis claims she is no longer liable for payment under the equipment lease.  REQUIRED (5 Points): With respect to Central's claim against Francis and Francis' defense discussed above, which party is correct?   Discuss.

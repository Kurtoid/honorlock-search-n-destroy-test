Follow the directions in each question carefully, and choose the BEST answer from the choices presented. The purpose of the exam is to assess what you have learned so far in the course. If you were planning to cheat in any way on this exam, now is the time to make a wiser decision. Academic Integrity is not taken lightly and any evidence of cheating will be sent to the Academic Honesty committee for review and possible sanctions. Most often, students who cheat receive a 0 for the exam, or in the course, and a permanent mark on their transcript. Your Honorlock session (audio, video and transcripts) will be reviewed before your grade can be validated and recorded. Remember, any irregularities in this exam session may lead to the invalidation of your exam score. If there are irregularities that cannot be explained, you may be required, at the instructor's discretion, to take a follow up exam live, in real time, with the instructor or course Graduate Assistants, within 48 hours. If the results of the follow up exam are not satisfactory, you may receive a zero for this exam.  Things that might flag your exam for follow up include, but are not limited to: Answering a question without having read the question Looking off to the side of your screen or camera (or anywhere else but the question you're answering) Unidentifiable or illegal sounds or background (another voice, shuffling of papers, etc.) Sound turned off during the exam Reading the questions aloud in their entirety Sound not matching the video in the session Insufficient/misleading scan of your surroundings and/or ID Most of you are already standing on your own knowledge and achievement to take this exam, making this statement a formality.  For those who have ideas about approaching this work from any other angle, keep in mind that you are gambling with your future if you violate the Auburn Creed or any of the policies for Academic Honesty at our University. Good luck to everyone.

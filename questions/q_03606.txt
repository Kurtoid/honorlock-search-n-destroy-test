Considering Z as a candidate instrumental variable, use Wright's rules to express the instrumental-variables estimate for the causal effect of T on Y in terms of the path coefficients.
Cestodes like these (image on left) were recovered incidentally from the small intestine of a sheep at necropsy that had a fatal burden of Haemonchus contortus. The length of some of these cestodes was about 3 meters! Clinical signs were not associated with this cestode. Eggs like this one (inset in image on left) were also recovered in a fecal flotation from the same sheep.    a. Name the genus of cestode recovered. Genus: [1]    b. Name the unique structure within the egg (a remnant from the larval "embryophore"). [2]   c. Trematodes were recovered from the bile ducts and liver of another sheep on pasture. One specimen was stained and mounted on a slide, shown here (image on right). Identify this parasite (genus and species). Genus: [3] Species: [4]

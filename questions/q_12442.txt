Use the formula for future value,  to find the missing quantity.A = $3240; r = 5%; t = 4 years
Provide an appropriate response.Data sets A and B are dependent. Test the claim that md =0. Use a = 0.01. Assume that the paired data came from a population that is normally distributed.
One of the landmark moments for surgical medicine came with the discovery in 1942 that a compound from the South American plant called curare (pronounced cure-are-ay) could be used as a supplemental anesthetic.   Prior to that, the main types of anesthetics used in surgery were drugs like diethyl ether.  For an anesthetic to be effective for surgery, it needs to induce a state of unconsciousness and prevent widespread body movement.  The problem with ether was that while a small dose could induce unconsciousness, a much larger dose was required to induce muscle paralysis.     Curare is a selective skeletal muscle paralytic.  (For exactly this reason, many different indigenous peoples in South America have historically used curare extract to coat arrows and darts for hunting.) Curare -- when used in conjunction with ether -- allowed surgeons to use smaller doses of ether, making surgeries much safer. Given what you are told here, what kind of drug is curare?

Mars exploration science company claims that the time it takes for their teleport machine to warm up is at most 15 minutes. A sample of 33 teleport machines found the sample mean to be 15.3 minutes with a population standard deviation of 1.35 minutes. We want to test if the teleport machine takes longer than 15 minutes to warm up. Conduct a hypothesis test at the 5% significance level. (a) State the null and alternative hypothesis on your scratch paper. (b) Using your calculator find the test statistic. Round to 3 decimal places. [teststat] (c) State the p-value and draw a picture.  (d) Do you reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject the null hypothesis? Why? State on your scratch paper.  (e) Interpret your decision. State on your scratch paper.  a, c, d, e are on your scratch paper? [yes]

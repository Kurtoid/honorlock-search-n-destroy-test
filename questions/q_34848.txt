CM is an unemployed 29 year old Caucasian male.  During high school, CM was very active playing defensive tackle for the football team.  He weighed 290 lbs and was 6'2" tall.  CM was heavily recruited by colleges and attended one for a year, but injured his knee and was no longer able to play.  He quit school but continued to eat as if he was still working out with the team.  He had a few odd jobs until he started driving a tractor trailer truck across the states.  His boss fired him because his weight was impairing his work. CM ate a huge amount of during high school, but was active enough to maintain his 290 lbs.  His jobs, including driving the truck, were very sedentary but he continued to eat as he did in high school, and sometimes more due to boredom. He slowly gained weight throughout the years, weighing 460 lbs a little over 6 months ago.  He cannot find a job, has no friends left in the area and when he tries to be active, his weight and his knee pain limits him.  He becomes winded now if he walks more than 50 feet.  He basically sits at home watching tv or playing video games.  His mom and sisters provide him with the one thing he loves - food.  Feeling sorry for him, they make him anything he wants.  Eating is his comfort, and his escape from reality, and the cycle of depression/eating/weight gain continues.

The ED physician found him to be SOB to the point of having cyanotic extremities, particularly in the toes.  CM was experiencing tachycardia with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVC)s. His left calf was tender to touch, warm and seemed to be swollen, but it was difficult to examine properly because of his size.  The physician was concerned that CM had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

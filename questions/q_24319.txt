Use the following information to answer the following question(s).The dune-burrowing spider Seothyra sp. lives in the Namib desert on the southwestern coast of Africa. These spiders build silk-lined burrows with a sticky silk mat at the entrance to trap insect prey. While foraging during the day, the spider remains concealed in its burrow and shielded from direct radiation when prey are not present. During the day, environmental temperatures vary from 17 to 73degC (63-164degF). If a spider is prevented from retreating into its burrow, it shows signs of thermal stress at 49degC, whereas unrestrained spiders continue to forage at temperatures above 65degC. In addition, spiders respond more quickly to prey stimuli during the hottest times of the day and capture prey in significantly less time when temperatures are above 49degC. The captured arthropods (prey) tend to succumb more quickly to hot surface temperatures; they are more lethargic and struggle less when captured at the high temperature ranges.  When spiders show signs of thermal stress, this is an indication that they are unable to  [ans1]. When foraging spiders are too hot, they retreat into the cooler confines of their burrows. When temperatures are cooler, they move closer to the surface of the burrow to increase their body temperatures. What type of feedback system does this indicate? [ans2]

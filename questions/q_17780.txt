When placed on an agar plate and incubated at 30degC for 2 days, a single yeast cell undergoes cell division and proliferates into a colony with a diameter of 2 mm containing 108 yeast cells.  If the cell has a functional Ade2 gene (Ade2 +), the colony will be white if Ade2 is non-functional (Ade2 -), the colony will be black.  You take a strain with Ade2 - at the regular chromosomal position (black colonies), and insert a second, functional Ade2 + gene near the centromere. You find that the resulting colonies are a mixture of black and white patches or sectors. The figure below shows some resulting colonies from this experiment.  You take single cells from a white sector and allow them to form new colonies.  The color of these colonies will MOST LIKELY be:

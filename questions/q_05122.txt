The marketing manager believes there is a 40% probability for a good market and a 10% probability for a fair market. The demand forecasts and profit per customer order are in Table 1. Assume 100% yields and no discounts. Question 1 uses Table 1. Table 1. Running Sock Order Forecasts and Projected Profits Note:  No. refers to design number in the table    No. Good Market Forecast Good Market Profit/Order Fair Market Forecast Fair Market Profit/Order Poor Market Forecast Poor Market Profit/Order   1 480 orders $4.00/order 340 orders $4.00/order 260 orders $4.00/order   2 420 orders $4.50/order 330 orders $4.50/order 250 orders $4.50/order    1a) Using Table 1, the running sock design 1 profit forecast for a good market is $[D1GoodProfit]. 1b) Using Table 1, the running sock design 1 profit forecast for a fair market is $[D1FairProfit]. 1c) Using Table 1, the running sock design 1 profit forecast for a poor market is $[D1PoorProfit]. 1d) Using Table 1, the total expected profit from running sock design 1 is $[EMV1]. 1e) Using Table 1, the running sock design 2 profit forecast for a good market is $[D2GoodProfit].  1f) Using Table 1, the running sock design 2 profit forecast for a fair market is $[D2FairProfit]. 1g) Using Table 1, the running sock design 2 profit forecast for a poor market is $[D2PoorProfit]. 1h) Using Table 1, the total expected profit from running sock design 2 is $[EMV2]. 1i) Using Table 1, the decision tree analysis recommendation for the running sock design is [Design].

Bacteria prefer to use glucose as an energy source, but can use other sugars, such as arabinose or maltose in the absence of glucose.  Imagine that you have set up a genetic screen to identify E. coli mutants that cannot metabolize the sugar maltose for energy.  Beginning with a master plate containing many colonies, you prepare replica plates on medium with glucose or maltose as the only energy source.  To find mutants that cannot metabolize maltose, you would look for colonies that ________.

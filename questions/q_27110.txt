Ebola is a disease found in East-Central and West Africa, but is not common in other regions of Africa or the world.  There are several types of ebolaviruses, which includes Ebola Zaire.  Between 1-10 viral particles of Ebola Zaire is sufficient to cause the disease (also known as hemorrhagic fever), which has a fatality rate of 80%.  A person can only spread Ebola to other people once signs and symptoms of Ebola begin to develop. The virus spreads through direct contact with body fluids or objects (such as bedding, clothing, etc.) that are contaminated with body fluids of infected individuals. Ebola causes hemorrhaging/bleeding when one of its surface protein EBOV-GP disrupts the endothelial walls of the blood vessels thus causing them to become leaky.  Select the best answer for each of the following questions. Q1: The clothing of infected individuals is a [Q1]. Q2: EBOV-GP can also be called [Q2]. Q3: We can assume that Ebola Zaire has a [Q3]. Q4: The Ebola virus is [Q4] to West Africa. Q5: Ebola is NOT contagious during which stage? [Q5]

The alleles his-5 and lys-1 found in baker's yeast results in cells that require histidine and lysine for growth. A cross was made between two haploid yeast stains that are his-5 lys-1 and his+lys+. From the analysis of 500 individuals tetrads, the following numbers were obtained: 1 spore: his-5 lys-1 +     1 spore: his-5 lys+    +    1 spore: h is+ lys-1      1 spore: his+lys+  =300 2 spores: his-5 lys+  + 2 spores:his+ lys-1  =50 2 spores: his-5 lys-1  + 2 spores:his+  lys+  =150 Compute map distance between two genes. Map Distance= T+ 6NPD/ total number x 0.5 x 100

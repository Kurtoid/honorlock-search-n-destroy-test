Amy entered school and was placed in a classroom for children with hearing loss during part of her day to strengthen her language skills. She spent the rest of her day in the mainstream/inclusion environment with typically developing peers. She is making progress, but is still noticeably behind her peers in her skills. Speech-Language services were provided three times per week. She had two individual sessions for articulation, auditory, and language per her IEP. She also had one session in the classroom environment (i.e. inlcusion; push-in services). Amy's parents requested a team evaluation during her first-grade year to gain input on their daughter's progress and to determine if she was ready to access a regular classroom full-time. The only concern raised by the school was Amy's tendency to "shut down" and avoid responding following some adult requests at school. What areas of assessment do you believe need to be completed?  Who is on your team? What information do you want in order to make a placement decision for Amy?

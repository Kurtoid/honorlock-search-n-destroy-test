[Essay] The Supreme Court has been very cautious in exercising judicial review during the early stages of American constitutional development. This is particularly true in regards to the Court's greater reluctance to exercise horizontal judicial review (vs. other federal branches) as opposed to vertical judicial review (vs. the states). In fact, SCOTUS has only struck down a federal statute twice prior to the Civil War, once during Marbury v. Madison (1803) and the second time during Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857). The consequences of these two cases, however, present a stark contrast as Marbury was widely hailed even at the time, whereas Dred Scott was fiercely condemned as triggering the Civil War. How might one explain this contrast in reception? More importantly, what does this tell us about the role of the Supreme Court in American politics prior to the Civil War or about the nature of judicial power more generally? Present an original response using supporting evidence and/or examples that reinforce your argument.

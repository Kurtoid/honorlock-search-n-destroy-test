Calculate the amount of energy (in kJ) to be required for a 100-g sample of benzene (C6H6, M = 78.115 g/mol) at 2.00 degC to rise to 80.00 degC? The normal freezing point for benzene is 5.85 degC and boiling point is 80.10 degC. Physical data associated with benzene is given below but not all of the data may be needed. Give the answer in kJ and at least one decimal place Cs, solid = 1.51 J/g*degC                     Cs, liquid = 1.73 J/g*degC              Cs, gas = 1.06 J/g*degC DHfus = 9.80 kJ/mol                DHvap = 33.9 kJ/mol

Have you attended any engagement sessions with Coach Rosarnie? If so, were they helpful? Please provide optional feedback here if you have any regarding the engagement sessions. Note, attending 1 per week earned you a bonus point, up to 3 on a test! Rosarnie kept attendance, and I'll add the bonus points to this question. There is no penalty if you did not attend. I recommend you attend in the future! If you were unable to attend, but would like the option, please let me know how I might bridge the gap for you.

[Asset Allocation Set-up for Questions 12 to 14] You have $1 million currently invested entirely in mutual fund A. You are considering switching into a combination of T-bills and mutual fund B for the next year. Mutual fund B is invested 50% in the stock of ABC and 50% in the stock of XYZ. A one year T-bill with face value $10,000 is currently selling for $9,523 (i.e. the risk free rate is 5%). After empirical analysis, you have the following assessments of the return to mutual fund A along with the returns to ABC and XYZ for the next year.E(r_A) = 0.10, E(r_ABC ) = 0.10, E(r_XYZ ) = 0.18s_A = 0.20, s_ABC = 0.20, s_XY Z = 0.30You have also determined that the correlation coefficient r_ABC,XYZ between returns on ABC and XYZ is 0.4.Using just the T-bill and mutual fund B, you want to construct an investment that is better than your current investment in mutual fund A.

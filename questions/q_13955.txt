Fleur wanted to know if Grandma Rose ever learned about cancers associated with MEN1. Grandma Rose explained that she heard a lot from her mother who was a research scientist at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia in the 1940's and was there when they discovered the association between chronic myelogenous leukemia and the Philadelphia chromosome.

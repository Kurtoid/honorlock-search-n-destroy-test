Copy this table into a blank excel spreadsheet.  To select the table, start at the year and click and drag until the table is selected then right click and select copy.  Open a blank excel spreadsheet and paste into the excel spreadsheet.  The annual returns expressed in decimal format are provided.  The three companies you will work with in this problem is ResMed (Ticker: RMD), Target (Ticker: TGT), and Waste Management (Ticker: WM).    Year RMD TGT WM   2011 -0.2667 0.4542 -0.1128   2012 0.6366 0.3153 0.0315   2013 0.1325 0.5013 0.3299   2014 0.1907 0.0761 0.1437   2015 -0.0423 0.034 0.0399   2016 0.1557 0.0595 0.3286   2017 0.3649 0.0177 0.2170   2018 0.3446 0.1703 0.0312   2019 0.3609 0.3648 0.2806   2020 0.3716 0.1184 0.0348      In excel, do the following:  Calculate the Average Return, Standard Deviation (population), and Coefficient of Variation for each stock  Discuss the comparison of the return, risk, and coefficient of variation for the three stocks (please use a text box for discussion). Calculate the correlation between each pair of stocks. Discuss the correlation as it relates to potential diversification (please use a text box for discussion) Form a new column of data titled "Portfolio." This column should contain the annual portfolio returns for an equal weighted portfolio of the three stocks.   Calculate the Average Return, Standard Deviation (population), and Coefficient of Variation for the portfolio returns  Discuss the comparison of the return, risk, and coefficient of variation for the individual stocks versus the portfolio (please use a text box for discussion). Calculate the weights of the minimum variance portfolio (MVP) using Target (TGT) as Asset A and ResMed (RMD) as Asset B.  Once you have found the weights, calculate the Portfolio Return and Risk using the MVP weights and the formula for a two asset portfolio.     Note:  All of the above calculations should be performed in excel using the correct excel function or correct formula (all work must be done in excel).

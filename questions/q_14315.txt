Describe the contribution of T lymphocyte effector functions to the maintenance of immune homeostasis Please address the following points: A. What is a regulatory T cell (what are markers associated with it, How are they activated, How are they generated, what are their roles in immune function?) Be sure to distinguish between induced versus naturally occurring Tregs. B. compare and contrast Th1 and Th2 cells (how do they develop-what do they do).  provide at least 3 comparisons/three distinctions C. What evidence, if any, suggests that specific strains of bacteria can influence T cell effector functions
What is epigenetics?
A single gene controls seed coat pattern in lentils. There are four common alleles for this gene. The first allele, symbolized R, produces a marbled pattern. The second allele, symbolized rs, produces a spotted pattern. The third allele, symbolized rd, produces a dotted pattern. The fourth allele, symbolized r, produces a clear pattern. The relationships between these alleles are R>rs=rd>r. A plant with marbled seeds is crossed to one with spotted seeds. This is the P generation. The phenotypic ratio in the F1 generation is 2 marbled seeds:1 spotted-dotted seeds (both spotted and dotted phenotypes):1 dotted seeds. Two of the plants in the F1 generation are crossed. One of these plants has marbled seeds, and the other has dotted seeds. This cross produced an F2 generation with a phenotypic ratio of 2 marbled seeds: 1 dotted seeds: 1 clear seeds. Using this information, match the phenotype of each of the following plants to their correct genotype.

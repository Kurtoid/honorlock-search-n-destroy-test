The following chart show the progress up to week 4. The one number that can be used to represent how the project is doing regarding both cost and schedule is the Cost Schedule Index (CSI).  Based upon these conditions, what would be the CSI for this project?  Cost Performance Index: CPI = BCWP/ACWP Cost Variance = CV = BCWP - ACWP Schedule Performance Index: SPI = BCWP/BCWS Schedule Variance = SV = BCWP - BCWS Cost Schedule Index: CSI = CPI x SPI

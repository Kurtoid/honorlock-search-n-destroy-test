Read the Case study to answer the questions 1-6:   You are caring for the 74-year-old female admitted to your unit with weakness, confusion, and a history of chronic heart failure and chronic diuretic use.  In addition to being confused, the patient responds slow to questions and has generalized weakness.  Vitals are: BP 90/62, HR 112- irregular, weak peripheral pulses, RR 12/min and shallow, decreased skin turgor and dry mucous membranes.  Labs are as follow: Na+ 141, K+ 2.5, Cl- 85, HCO3 43, BUN 42, and Hct 49%.

Part (a) (10 points) A circular loop with a 6.50 cm radius exists in the xy{"version":"1.1","math":"xy"}-plane as shown below. There is a uniform magnetic field with magnitude of 375 m{"version":"1.1","math":"m"}T that exists that points 70.0 degrees away from the +z{"version":"1.1","math":"+z"}-axis. In 460 m{"version":"1.1","math":"m"}s the magnitude of the magnetic field increases by a factor of 6 (Bf=6B0{"version":"1.1","math":"Bf=6B0"}). In the immediate 360 m{"version":"1.1","math":"m"}s after this, the magnetic field rotates to be pointing exactly in the -z{"version":"1.1","math":"-z"}-direction but stays a constant magnitude. What is the average induced emf in the loop over the full 820 m{"version":"1.1","math":"m"}s? Part (b) (4 points) Based on the picture/problem above, what is the sense of the direction of the induced current (clockwise or counterclockwise) during each of the two changes described in part a. (Note that you should clearly indicate the current during the time the magnetic field is increasing in magnitude and the current during the time the magnetic field is changing direction.)

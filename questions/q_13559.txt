Consider the execution of an arbitrary flow-insensitive, context-insensitive, field-sensitive pointer analysis (as was presented in the pointer analysis lesson) on the following programs. For each program, select whether the pointer analysis can prove the assertion using a type-based or an allocation-site based heap abstraction. Assume the following class definition for type Node: class Node { int data; Node next; } Program: Node v1 = new Node();Node v2 = new Node();v1.next = v2;v2.next = v1;assert(v1.next != v2.next);  Can prove assertion with type-based heap abstraction? [p3type] Can prove assertion with allocation-site based heap abstraction? [p3alloc]

The gas phase system below is at equilibrium at 200degC with the following partial pressures: 0.20 atm A, 0.20 atm B, 0.10 atm C, and 0.40 atm D. If an additional 0.30 atm C is introduced into the reaction vessel, what will be the partial pressure of C at 200degC when equilibrium is re-established? A(g)  +  B(g)  =  C(g)  +  D(g)

Well flow (20 pts): An unconfined aquifer water table is 12.2 m thick has a full penetrating well with a diameter of 4-in (0.1 m). The extraction rate is 0.15 m3/min in the aquifer that is sandy with a hydraulic conductivity of 8.2 m/day.  A steady-state drawdown of 1.5 m is observed in a monitoring well at 3.0 m from the pumping well. Determine the: a. ) drawdown in the pumping well at this pumping rate, and b.) minimum distance from the pumping well that a monitoring well must installed in order for there to be no drawdown observed (in the monitoring well) (i.e., where is s= 0.0 m).
Which of the following is true about the base peak in mass spectrometry?

This is the same passage from Question 16, copied for your reference. Bearded dragons are popular reptiles in the pet trade and demonstrate multiple mutations in pattern, scale type, and color. Most bearded dragons express normal coloration in shades of gray or brown, which is a dominant trait. However, many breeders try to produce dragons that express a recessive mutation called "zero," where the dragons are silver. Use "N" to represent the dominant allele for normal coloration and "n" to represent the recessive allele for the zero mutation. These alleles follow the inheritance pattern for complete dominance. You cross a bearded dragon that expresses the zero mutation with one that is heterozygous for coloration. What percentage of the offspring should express the zero mutation?

A) Alpha Corporation owns assets valued at $400,000 and liabilities of $100,000. Beta Corporation transfers $160,000 of its voting stock and $40,000 in cash for 75% of Alpha's assets and all of its liabilities. Alpha distributes its remaining assets and the Beta stock to its shareholders. Alpha then liquidates.

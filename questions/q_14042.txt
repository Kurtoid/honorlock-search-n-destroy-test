Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a genetic disorder in which melanomas and other skin cancers are frequently found in children, possibly resulting in a very short overall life expectancy.  AIDS is a syndrome which develops late post-HIV infection if individuals are not receiving treatment (like anti-retroviral therapy) or if they no longer respond to treatment.  Developing AIDS increases one's risk of developing different types of cancers, in some cases more than 100-fold. Compare and contrast these two conditions by: A)  Indicate what pathway or system is "broken" in XP and AIDS which normally would help prevent cancer. B)  Indicate what the initiating mutations would be for both. C)  Indicate why it is possible to observe cancers associated with XP in children when age is the greatest risk factor for developing cancer?  Explain why this could also be true for AIDS patients.

Passage 3          How would you like to live to be 100 years old? You may be thinking "That's simply not possible," but actually, becoming a centenarian--someone who has reached the age of 100 years or more--is not as inconceivable as you might think. The United States currently has more centenarians than anywhere else in the world--over 96,000--and that number is increasing significantly worldwide. Researchers on aging have discovered that people are living longer these days because of the influence of three types of factors: hereditary, environmental, and cultural. An awareness of centenarians' longevity secrets may help us all reach our goal of achieving a long, healthy, and fulfilling life.         Centenarians share several common hereditary traits. Many of these older people are tall and lean. And a large number of centenarian women gave birth later in life, after age 40; a fertile reproductive system at 40 or beyond is considered an overall indication of a body that is aging slower than "normal." Centenarians also tend to escape many diseases associated with aging, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and dementia. Additionally, findings of recent centenarian studies indicate that extreme old age does indeed run in families. Many centenarians have children who are in their 70s and 80s, with very few age-related disorders. Finally, most centenarians have at least one other long-lived close relative in their family histories.          But what if we don't possess exceptional genetics that would guarantee longevity? Environmental factors within our control can contribute to a longer life, too. One such characteristic is that most of these older people have never smoked heavily or abused alcohol. Also, centenarians continue to exercise and perform physical tasks and activities associated with functioning independently in everyday life. They report being active well into their 80s and 90s; many of them are even still working. Eating a diet heavy on grains, fish, and vegetables but light on meat, eggs, and dairy products is another environmental factor contributing to centenarians' health. In addition, social interactions give them a sense of purpose, caring, happiness, and community. And centenarians know that relaxation is important; to them, time for play and recreation is essential. Last of all, centenarians stay curious about the world and their surroundings instead of withdrawing inside themselves. They also tend to be lifelong learners who take up entirely new hobbies late in life--pursuits that stimulate neural connections and actually slow aging within the brain.          In addition to genetic and environmental effects on longevity, cultural attitudes seem to play a role in life expectancy. Significantly, a common theme among centenarians worldwide is continuing to feel important and valued in their culture. Sadly, U.S. society has tended to devalue the contributions of the elderly and expects little from them as they age. This negative attitude toward aging sends a clear social signal: that age alone differentiates between a person's being useful or useless, valued or not valued, wanted or unwanted. If cultural attitudes in the U.S. were to change, American centenarians would then possess all three significant factors in the quest for a longer, richer life. According to the passage, centenarians tend to

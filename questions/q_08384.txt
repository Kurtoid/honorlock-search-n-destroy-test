The City of East Shaker developed a standard operating procedure that required every person arrested to be strip searched upon booking into the city jail. Officers must conduct the strip search when the suspect is booked into the jail. The strip search involves requiring the suspect to remove clothing and to move body parts as demanded by the officer conducting the search. This search includes a body cavity search. While on routine traffic patrol, Officer Grendell observed a car driving around a general business district. The car would travel slowly as some points, stop completely at times in roadway, pause for a short time, and then proceed driving. The car would then turn into a driveway, back up, change directions to come down the street and repeat the same traffic pattern. Officer Grendel observed the vehicle make three separate trips up and down the street. Officer Grendell believed that the driver was either looking for a parking space or was waiting for a partner in crime to exit one of the various stores after robbing it. He was not sure which scenario was most likely. On the car's fourth time up the street, Officer Grendell activated his dash cam, turned on his emergency lights, and stopped the vehicle. The car immediately pulled off the road into a city-owned parking lot. Officer Grendell approached the car and asked the driver to exit the vehicle. The driver, Andrea Escobar, exited the vehicle and demanded to know why the officer had stopped her. Before Officer Grendell could explain, Escobar continued to vehemently insist that Officer Grendell was harassing people, was seeking to enforce draconian traffic laws for the profit of the city, and, that he personally, was a most foul and disgusting form of human being bent on violating people's civil rights. At this point Officer Grendell asked Ms. Escobar for her driver's license and proof of insurance. Ms. Escobar reached into her car, took out her wallet and threw her driver's license in the general direction of Officer Grendell. The license fell to the ground at his feet. When asked for her proof of insurance (required under state law) she responded: "Insurance, I don't need no stinkin' insurance!" At this point Ms. Escobar was arrested for driving without proof of insurance (a minor misdemeanor subject only to a fine upon conviction). This is not an arrestable offense under state law. Officer Grendell transported Ms. Escobar to the city jail where she was booked into the jail. A female officer took Ms. Escobar into a private room where the officer performed a strip search. The officer found a small bag of marijuana inside Ms. Escobar's underwear. The strip search of Ms. Escobar was:

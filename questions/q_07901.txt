34) Professor McMurray teaches two sections of Introduction to Biology. The two sections are identical with one exception. In both sections, halfway through each lecture, the students must read an article about the day's topic and then answer five questions about the article's content.   In Section #1, the students do this assignment alone. They're not allowed to talk or converse with any other students. In Section #2, the students do this assignment in groups of five.

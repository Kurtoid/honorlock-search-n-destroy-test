22)  Predict and sketch the 1H-NMR spectrum for 2-nitropropane:  H3C-CH(NO2)-CH3    On your work sheet, first draw an x-axis ppm scale and include a TMS peak.  Then copy one of the 3D structural representations of the compound above so that you can label all protons with letters indicating those that are equivalent.  Then label the corresponding peaks in your spectrum.  Be sure to indicate relative peak sizes, splitting pattern and ratios, and accurate peak positions (use table 19-2 in formula sheet).  Assume we have full resolution.  You can magnify peak sets if you want, as long as you label all relative peak sizes appropriately

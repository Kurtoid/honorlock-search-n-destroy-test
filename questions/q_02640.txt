Problem 2 A mechanism used to rescue sailors at sea is shown below.  You feel that the mechanism may be improved by adding a spring between the pulley and the person, and build a prototype of it.  You use an old punching bag to model the sailor and chair, and a spring that you ordered online.  The spring's specifications include stiffness k = 75 lb/in, unstretched length = 6 inches, and the statement: "This spring will experience permanent damage if stretched beyond a final length of 8.5 inches."  Knowing that the tension in the cable CD is 37 lbs and assuming the weight remains vertically oriented, find the mass of the punching bag and the stretched length of the spring.  If the punching bag's weight accurately reflects the weight of a typical sailor, would this spring be safe for your application?      Formatting:  In each of the first two blanks, enter a value approximated to three significant figures with units.  In the last blank, answer "yes" or "no". mass of punching bag = [mass_W] stretched length of spring = [stretched_length] Is the spring safe? = [spring_safe]

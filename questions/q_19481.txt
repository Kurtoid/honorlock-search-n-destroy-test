Chloe is a 5 y/o female who was recently prescribed cefdinir (Omnicef) as treatment for recurrent acute otitis media. Her mother calls into the office scared because her daughter reported her stools to be reddish in color. She is having no symptoms of fatigue, weakness, or dizziness but does report watery diarrhea. You should have her be seen in the emergency department to be evaluated for bleeding.
Two systems, A and B, have been prepared identically in a superposition wavefunction that can only give either E1 or E2 as values for the energy. The energy of system A is measured to be E1. If the energy of system A is measured again immediately, a [blank1] outcome is expected. If the energy of system B is measured, a [blank2] outcome is expected.

Energy conservation with nonconservative forces: A 1.37-kg block is held in place against the spring by a 74-N horizontal external force (see the figure). The external force is removed, and the block is projected with a velocity v1 = 1.2 m/s upon separation from the spring. The block descends a ramp and has a velocity  at the bottom. The track is frictionless between points A and B. The block enters a rough section at B, extending to E. The coefficient of kinetic friction over this section is 0.24. The velocity of the block is  at C. The block moves on to D, where it stops. The initial compression of the spring is closest to

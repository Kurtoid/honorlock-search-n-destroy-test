Could Griffith's Transformation experiment be used to show conjugation?  Explain why or why not.
In Drosophila, an individual female fly was observed to be of the XXY chromosome complement (normal autosomal complement) and to have white eyes as contrasted with the normal red eye color of wild type. The female's mother and father had red eyes. The mother, however, was heterozygous for the gene for white eyes. Knowing that white eyes are X-linked and recessive, present an explanation for the genetic and chromosomal constitution of the XXY, white-eyed individual.

Problem 5) Test Bench for your FSM ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner. The tool bar has indent functions. Write a Verilog (or System Verilog) test bench that tests your FSM in problem 4 for the sequence 111011010. Include a $display,  or $monitor to write x, State, and Z at each clock. For maximum credit your code should carefully follow the specification. Use the minimum number of lines to accomplish this specification. Also use proper indentation for organization. Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables. Do not use compiler directives except perhaps `timescale. ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate

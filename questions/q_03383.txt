You are running a mammography screening program in a van that travels around your health district. A 45-year-old woman has a mammogram. The study is interpreted as "suspicious for malignancy" by the radiologist. The patient asks you: "Does this mean I have cancer?", and you (correctly) answer "No, we have to do further testing." She then asks, "OK, I understand that the mammogram isn't the final answer, but given what we know now, what are the chances that I have breast cancer?"  Assume that the overall risk of breast cancer in any 45-year-old woman, regardless of mammogram result, is 0.1% or one in a thousand. Imagine: 10,000 women, 0.1% of whom have cancer: 9,990 women without cancer 10 women with cancer 8 women with a positive mammogram who have cancer 2 woman with a negative mammogram who has cancer 9490 women with a negative mammogram who do not have cancer 500 women with a positive mammogram who do not have cancer.

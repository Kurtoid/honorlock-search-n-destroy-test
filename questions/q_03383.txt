Consider the following payoff table where d1,d2, and d3 represent the available decisions and s1, s2 and s3 represent the possible states of nature.  The numbers in the table represent profits.           s1   s2   s3     d1   3000   1000   1500     d2   1000   1200   1400     d3   5000   500   1200       Assume that we have no information about the probabilities of the states of nature, s1,s2,s3.  Use the Maximax approach to choose a decision Use the Maximin approach to choose a decision. Assume now that we have probability estimates for these states as follows p(s1) = .4, p(s2)  = .3, p(s3) = .3  Using the expected value approach, which decision should be chosen? What is the Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) for this problem?

Flower diameter in sunflowers is a quantitative trait. A plant with 8-cm flowers and aabb genotype is crossed to a plant with 16-cm flowers and a AABB. What will be the diameter of F1 generation?
The graph below represents output from a model that simulates disease dynamics in a population.  It is called a SIR model because it tracks the number of (S)usceptible, (I)nfected, and (R)ecovered individuals in the population.  Identify what part of the population (S, I, and R) each curve represents.   Curve [c1] shows Susceptible  Curve [c2] shows Infected  Curve [c3] shows Recovered

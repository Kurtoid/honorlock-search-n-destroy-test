In Koi fish, R (red/deep orange) and r (white) are codominant alleles and heterozygotes are mottled orange and white. In the population of Koi in Hattingboro Pond, the frequency of allele r is 0.5 in the population and the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There are 40 Koi in the pond. How many Koi do you expect to be mottled fish? Use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to obtain your answer.Write the numerical response only (i.e. the number)

Use Coulomb's law to calculate the energy of 12 electrons 0.220 nm away from a nucleus with a net charge of +2.   where . . . Q1 is the overall charge of the electrons Q2 is the charge of the nucleus r is the distance between the charges in units of meters (m) k = 8.99 x 109 N m2 C-2    Charge of one proton = 1.60 x 10-19 C Charge of one electron = 1.60 x 10-19 C   Report your answer in scientific notation using the "E" convention.  For example, if you wanted to report an answer of 3.45 x 106, you would type "3.45E6". Be sure to use the correct number of significant figures.

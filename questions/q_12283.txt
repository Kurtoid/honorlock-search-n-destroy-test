A Bi-wall polycarbonate greenhouse has a setpoint temperature of 65 oF for heating. The lowest outdoor temperature for sizing the heating system is 43 oF. If the surface area of the greenhouse is 9000 ft2 and the volume of the greenhouse is 53000 ft3, determine the heating requirement of the greenhouse in Btu/h. Assume that the air exchanges per hour is 1.2.   (Please include your computational steps to earn full/partial points)   Q_total = Q_c + Q_i

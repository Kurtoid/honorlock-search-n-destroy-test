Case Study: Use the network diagram below and Appendix A to help you answer the question. IMPORTANT* Assume that all the switches already learn about all the nodes in the network and that the CAM table entries do not expire during the time that the communications took place.* The ARP table of each node and the routers will reflect the cumulative changes from previous events as each node communicates with one another and does not expire during the time that the communications took place.* Starting ARP tables for each node can be found in the Appendix A.  You need to use the Appendix to keep track of any changes to the ARP tables yourself, as each event occurs.    Bigger view of network diagram and starting ARP tables. Overview: Questions in the case study can be generic questions or questions related to one of the events.    Event 1: A talks to B Event 2: E talks to D Event 3: D talks to C Event 4: F talks to A Event 5: B talks to C    From the network diagram above, how many collision and broadcast domains are there?

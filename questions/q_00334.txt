In regards to the integrated responses:  When an increase in osmolarity of the extracellular fluid is sensed by the [cells] this causes an increased release of [hormone1] which leads to [moreless1] water reabsorption and a decreased release of [hormone2] which leads to [moreless2] sodium reabsorption. Overall in response to this increased osmolarity the body gets rid of [chemical1] and holds onto more [chemical2] resulting in a [updown] osmolarity of the extracellular space.

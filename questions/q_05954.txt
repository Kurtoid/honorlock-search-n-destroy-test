Question 2 - ARIMA(-GARCH) Modelling (40 Points) A. Building on your analysis from Q1A, use the additional relevant plot necessary to graphically evaluate possible ARMA(p,q) orders of each. B. for M2 and NSDQ time series data, use the iterative AIC selection process to find the best, non-trivial ARIMA model order using the max orders (4,2,4). Fit each model, perform root analysis, then perform and evaluate the Box-Ljung test results when performed on the model residuals and squared residuals.  C. For M2 growth data, using the ARMA order selected above and using the data pertaining to the level of differencing selected, use the iterative approach to select the best ARMA-GARCH order using a max order of (4,4)-(2,2). Fit the model and perform the same residual tests, commenting on if the addition of the GARCH component seems to have improved the fit. D. For the M2 growth data, write out the appropriate algebraic representations of both the first ARIMA and subsequent ARMA-GARCH models fit. E. Make the necessary alterations to the provided rolling forecast code to perform 48-single step forecasts using both the ARIMA and ARIMA-GARCH models. Compare the MAE, MAPE, and PM of the forecast based on the two models. Note: Forecasts are done in the same differencing frame (same data variable name) to permit direct comparison of results.

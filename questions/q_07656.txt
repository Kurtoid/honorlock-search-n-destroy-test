In which of the following measurement scales can you calculate frequencies? (you may choose one or more)
A beam consisting of five types of ions labeled A, B, C, D, and E enters a region that contains a uniform magnetic field as shown in the figure below. The field is perpendicular to the plane of the paper, but its precise direction is not given. All ions in the beam travel with the same speed. The table below gives the masses and charges of the ions. Determine the magnitude of the magnetic field if ion A travels in a semicircular path of radius 0.5 m at a speed of 5 x 106 m/s. Note: 1 mass unit = 1.67 x 10-27 kg and e = 1.6 x 10-19 C

A(n) ________ is a promise to deliver specific benefits associated with products or services to consumers.
In humans, ABO blood types refer to glycoproteins in the membranes of red blood cells. There are three alleles for this autosomal gene: IA, IB, and i. The IA allele codes for the A glycoprotein, The IB allele codes for the B glycoprotein, and the i allele doesn't code for any membrane glycoprotein. IA and IB are codominant, and i is recessive to both IA and IB. People with type A blood have the genotypes IAIA or IAi, people with type B blood are IBIB or IBi, people with type AB blood are IAIB, and people with type O blood are ii. If a woman with type B blood marries a man with type O blood, which of the following blood types could their children possibly have?

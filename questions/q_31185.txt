OM Construction Company must choose between two types of cranes that have identical capacity and do exactly the same job. Crane A costs $600,000, will last for two years, and will require $60,000 in maintenance each year. Crane B costs $750,000, will last for three years, and will require $30,000 in maintenance each year. Maintenance costs for cranes A and B occur at the end of each year. The appropriate discount rate is 12% per year. Which machine should OM Construction purchase?

In his 1996 conference address and essay, "The Ground on Which I Stand," August Wilson states his belief in continuing disparities in economics and privilege in late 20th-century America. As principal evidence of this disparity in American theatre, Wilson states that of the 66 League of Resident Theatres (LORT), the number of them that can be considered black is:

Problem Statement A digitally automated conveyor belt has been designed to count the number of items placed into a box. The conveyor belt has a sensor to count the number of items, and an error detection circuit displays a light if the number of items in the box is incorrect (due to manufacturing requirements).  Show the design of this error detection circuit with the following specifications:    The input to the error detection circuit is a 4-bit number, DCBA, representing the number of items in the box. The output of the error detection circuit provides a HIGH when the number of items is greater than 3, or less than 10. There will never be less than 4 items placed into the box, so the output of the error detection circuit does not matter when the sensor reaches a count of less than 4.     Requirements   Design a truth table to describe the output of the circuit. Using a K-map, write the simplified expression for the output.   In the answer box below, create your truth table.    Next, create your digital k-map in the answer box, below your truth table. On your scratch paper, make your circles and determine your output expression.  Below your digital k-map, type the output expression for the circuit. Depending on your method to solve the problem, you may end up with an output expression that does not utilize all four inputs.   Build the circuit in Multisim.  Use switches for each input D, C, B, A.  Connect the output of your circuit to an LED (probe).  Ensure that the circuit works correctly.  Submission Your submission should include: 1.)  All of the work that you used to design the circuit.  This should include your digitally created truth table, k-map/Boolean algebra, and simplified expression for the output.  2.) a Multisim file that contains your circuit.  This should NOT be a PDF, screenshot, JPEG, Word document, etc.  Submit your actual Multisim (.ms14) file once complete. When you are ready, click "Next".  You will be asked to submit your Multisim file.

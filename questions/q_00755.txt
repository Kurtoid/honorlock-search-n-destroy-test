Passing an electric current through water causes water to split to form hydrogen and oxygen gases: 2H2O (l) - 2H2 (g) + O2 (g). The process works if there is a sulfuric acid is present. Sulfuric acid exists in water as: H2SO4 (aq) - 2H+ (aq) + SO42- (aq). Without  the acid, the water splitting reaction would not happen. Explain why sulfuric acid is necessary for the water splitting reaction to happen. Limit your answer to 200 words. Use complete sentences and correct grammar.

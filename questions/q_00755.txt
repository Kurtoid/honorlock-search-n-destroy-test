Activation of  a TH cell begins when an antigen presenting cell like a macrophage presents an exogenous antigen using a/an [pro1].  TH cell recognizes the antigen with a/an [pro2] and also recognizes the presenting protein with its [pro3].  This recognition causes the TH cell to release cytokines, some of which make the APC more aggressive, and some of which act as costimulatory autocrine signals, activating the TH cell itself.  TH cell activation results in a process in which large numbers of effector cells called [cell2] cells are produced, along with a smaller number of [cell3] cells.

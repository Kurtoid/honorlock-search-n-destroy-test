Ramp metering is a traffic engineering idea that requires cars entering a freeway to stop for a certain period of time before joining the traffic flow. To test whether ramp metering is effective in reducing travel  times, engineers conducted an experiment in which a section of freeway had ramp meters installed on the  on-ramps. The response variable for the study was speed of the vehicles. A random sample of 15 cars on the highway for a Monday at 6 p.m. with the ramp meters on and a second random sample of 15 cars on a different Monday at 6 p.m. with the meters off resulted in the following summary statistics of vehicle speeds     Group   Mean   Std. dev.   n       Ramp_Meters_On   41.07   9.64   15     Ramp_Meters_Off   34.8   9.55   15     Is there evidence that the ramp meters are effective in producing higher average speeds on the freeway?  Let u1 = mean for ramp meter ON and u2 = mean for ramp meter OFF State the null and alternative hypothesis for this test.

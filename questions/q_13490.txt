Koleman and Logan are rival producers of camping tents. They are the only two producers of camping tents in the market, and their products are completely undifferentiated. Both firms have the same marginal cost: $5. They compete by setting quantity, and the market price is determined by the following inverse market demand curve: P(Q) = 85 - 4Q where Q is the total quantity demanded. (a) Suppose that Koleman is the market leader. Find the optimal quantity each firm will produce and the associated market price. (b) Now suppose that both firms produce simultaneously. Once again, find each firm's optimal quantity and the associated market price. (c) Suppose that these firms instead announced their prices simultaneously. Find the price each firm will set and the quantity they will sell at that price. Be sure to fully explain why this is the case. (d) Both firms are back to producing simultaneously like in part (b), but now Logan has the following cost function.

Problem 6 (10 points) The antenna at the earth station of a satellite communication link with a gain of 55 dB at 14 GHz is aimed at a geostationary satellite 36,500 km away. Assume that the antenna on the satellite has a gain of 35 dB and is transmitting the signal toward the earth station at 12 GHz. The minimum usable signal is 8x10-12 W. a) Find the minimum satellite transmitting power required if all the antenna and radiation efficiencies are 100% and all signal paths are lossless. b) Find the peak transmitting power needed by the radar at the earth station in order to detect the satellite as a passive object, assuming the backscatter cross section of the satellite including its solar panels is 25 m2 and the minimum detectable return pulse power is 0.5 pW.

Below you will find excerpts from an empirical article by Campbell et al. (2010). Please respond to the 6 fill-in-the blank questions.  In 1988, Raskin and Terry developed the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI), a self-report measure of narcissism. These researchers defined narcissism as including 7 distinct components: authority, entitlement, exhibitionism, explotativeness, self-sufficiency, superiority, and vanity. In order to provide evidence of [answer1] validity, Raskin and Terry (1988) included items that assessed each of the seven components of narcissism. In a 2010 paper, Campbell et al. agreed that entitlement is clearly a component of narcissism. However, these researchers noted that there are a few problems with using the NPI Entitlement subscale as a stand-alone measure of psychological entitlement. First, they argue, the NPI entitlement subscale lacks [answer2] validity: some items (e.g., "I will never be satisfied until I get all that I deserve") sound/look like they are measuring entitlement; but other items (e.g., "I have a strong will to power; If I ruled the world it would be a better place") sound/look more like power seeking or dominance. In addition, Campbell et al. (2010) argued that the NPI entitlement subscale lacks the degree of [answer3] reliability desired for self-report measures, with Cronbach alpha values often far below the .70 rule of thumb. Campbell et al. (2010) note: "Our goal in this article was to develop and validate a measure of psychological entitlement as well as look at some potential interpersonal consequences of entitlement. In the process, we gain a better theoretical understanding of the construct." Later, Campbell et al. (2010) note: "It is important to state explicitly our approach to psychological entitlement. We conceptualize psychological entitlement as a stable and pervasive sense that one deserves more and is entitled to more than others. This sense of entitlement will also be reflected in desired or actual behaviors." What is the name of the conceptual variable that Campbell et al. (2010) investigated? [answer4] Campbell et al. (2010) correlated scores on their Psychological Entitlement Scale (PES) with other measures as a test of the scale's validity. As expected, there was a positive correlation between scores on the PES and scores on Raskin and Terry's (1988) Entitlement subscale of the NPI (r = .54). This finding provides evidence of [answer5] validity for the PES. In addition, as expected, scores on the PES were not significantly correlated with social desirability (a measure of overall level of socially desirable responding), (r = -.06). This finding provides evidence of [answer6] validity for the PES.

Tell them your name, your age, where you live, and your nationality.  Tell them what you do and do not do, where you go. Tell them what time you do certain morning routine activities like getting up, getting dressed, brushing your teeth, taking a shower, eating breakfast, etc. You arrive to their town by train.  Tell them about your train's arrival and departure.   Handwrite your note and email the instructor a picture of your writing (meredithw@hartwick.edu).  When you have finished write "finished" in the box below and submit.  Have an enjoyable break!  I very much enjoyed working with you.

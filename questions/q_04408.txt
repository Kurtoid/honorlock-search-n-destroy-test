Butt Charge The state of Maine proposed a new law requiring every filter-tipped cigarette sold there to carry a nickel surcharge.37 The 5 cents would be refunded when the butt was returned, in the same way that cans and bottles carry deposits in some states. Butts would be returned to the same recycling locations that handle cans and bottles. According to the proposal, cigarette manufacturers would place a mark on the filter of each cigarette sold in Maine, indicating the 5-cent deposit notice. If passed, this law would raise the price of a pack of cigarette by $1. The law arose from problems caused by an earlier ban of cigarette smoking in most public places, forcing smokers outside and leading to the problem of used butts on the ground around the entrances to stores, public buildings, and parking lots. The law also seeks to provide a new source of revenue for the state while avoiding a general tax increase. If half of all butts of the cigarettes sold were returned for a deposit, the state would gain about $50 million in unclaimed deposits. Cigarette vendors and manufacturers did not support the proposed new law, arguing that it would push smokers to buy their cigarettes in other states. There was also the question of health concerns in handling used butts and the practical matter of counting the returned used cigarette butts.  You are a smoker living in Maine. Is it morally acceptable to enact such a law?  Or Delivering Illegal Prescription Drugs   FedEx Corporation was charged with conspiracy for delivering drugs that people had bought online illegally without a prescription. These illegal transactions were conducted via Internet pharmacies and totaled $820 million in FedEx delivery fees. FedEx argued that it delivers more than 10 million packages per day and cannot be held responsible for the legality of the transactions behind each package. FedEx also has cooperated law enforcement agencies over the years in multiple cases. The charges resulted from Internet pharmacies requiring customers only to fill out an online form, without a doctor's examination or prescription, and the drugs were delivered to them by FedEx. Court documents indicated that federal officials informed FedEx that illegal online pharmacies were using it for illegal drug deliveries. FedEx drivers in three states had told the company that their trucks were being stopped by people demanding packages of pills and threatening them with harm. In addition, some of the delivery addresses from Internet pharmacies were vacant houses where carloads of people were waiting for their drugs to arrive. In response, FedEx began to separate drug deliveries from Internet pharmacies and hold them for pickup at FedEx offices.45  Assess the ethical responsibility of the prosecutor's decision to bring criminal charges against a delivery company (FedEx) as a way to combat Internet pharmacies that offer drugs without prescription to online customers.

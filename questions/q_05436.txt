Researchers studying pleasant touch sensations measured the firing frequency (impulses per second) of nerves that were stimulated by a light brushing stroke on the forearm and also recorded the subject's numerical rating of how pleasant the sensation was.  The data from the study is below.    Firing Frequency Pleasantness Rating   23 .2   24 1.0   22 1.2   25 1.2   27 1.0   28 2.0   34 2.3   33 2.2   36 2.4   34 2.8    Carry out a hypothesis test to decide if there is convincing evidence of a useful linear relationship between firing frequency and pleasantness rating.  Use .05 as the level of significance.   Be sure to state the hypotheses, name the test you are using, give the test statistic and p-value, and to make your conclusion.

Papa Bruins just came to the Fairy Land Sherriff's office to report a crime. The Sherriff listens to Papa's account of what happened. He claimed that the family was burglarized by a little girl! Apparently, they came home from the market only to find their front door wide open.

While it seemed unlikely that a little girl could cause so much damage, this wasn't the first bit of trouble in Fairy Town. Just last week, two kids had been seen eating gum drops off of a neighbor's candy cottage, and the month before that, a Giant reported that a boy stole some magic beans.

Proteasomes are protein complexes which degrade unneeded or damaged proteins by proteolysis, a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds. They are part of a major mechanism by which cells regulate the concentration of particular proteins and degrade misfolded proteins. Proteins are tagged for degradation with a small protein called ubiquitin. What kind of enzyme attaches a chain of proteins to other proteins that have been targeted for degradation, thus ensuring their destruction in a proteasome?

You are rushing to finish your derivative homework at the last second, and you decide to copy your friend's work despite the the fact that this is a clear academic integrity violation. Your friend found the derivative of several functions, but he did not write down the original problem. Given the derivative f'(x) that your friend wrote down, work backwards to find a possible function f(x). a) f'(x)=3x2+2x{"version":"1.1","math":"f'(x)=3x2+2x"} b) f'(x)=1x+6x2+10{"version":"1.1","math":"f'(x)=1x+6x2+10"} c) f'(x)=2e2x+x{"version":"1.1","math":"f'(x)=2e2x+x"}

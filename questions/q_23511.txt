You will use this problem for Questions 8 and 9.  Read carefully!   In physics class, two "frictionless" carts are placed on a track.  The first cart (m1 = 0.620 kg) is pushed to the right with a speed of 4.5 m/s.  The second cart (m2 = 0.790 kg) is pushed to the left with a speed of 1.8 m/s.  If the first cart rebounds with a speed of 0.9 m/s, Q8:  find the speed and direction of the second cart. Q9:  Determine whether the collision is elastic or not. You must show your work for full credit!   For this question, enter the answer to Q9. (You will select "elastic" or "inelastic".

In this part of the question , you will go through a robot localization example in a 1D grid.  Let us discretize the configuration space into 10 cells.    Part 1: Initial Belief Suppose that the robot's initial belief is a uniform distribution from 0 to 3. Recall that this vector needs to add up to 1. Question 1: Please write on a table the initial belief distribution      Part 2: Prediction updateLet us assume that the robot moves forward with the following statistical model:      Question 2: What does this model mean?   Question 3: Calculate the belief after the action (prediction update)      Part 3: Measurement update Let us now assume that the robot uses its onboard range finder and measures the distance from the origin. Assume that the statistical error model of the sensors is:        Question 4: What does this model mean?   Question 5: What will the final robot belief be after this measurement   ?

Billy is sitting at the bus stop outside the College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences on a Winter's day. The gain of Billy's thermoregulatory system is 22 and his setpoint is 98.6 F. His digital thermometer indicates that the ambient temperature is 26.40 F. What is his body temperature?  Use the gain equation below:  Given:Gain = Correction / Error,Correction = Temperature without feedback - Temperature with feedback,Error = Temperature with feedback - Setpoint temperature,Normal set point is 98.6 F

In MIPS assembly, write an assembly language version of the following C code segment: int A[100], B[100];             for (i=1; i < 100; i++) {                                  A[i] = A[i-1] + B[i];                 } At the beginning of this code segment, the only values in registers are the base address of arrays A and B in registers $a0 and $a1.  Avoid the use of multiplication instructions-they are unnecessary. Please ensure to include your COMMNETS in the MIPS code (Without comments will not earn points).

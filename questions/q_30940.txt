A light string is wrapped around the outer rim of a solid uniform disk of diameter 2.0 m that can rotate without friction about an axle through its center of mass (geometrical center). A stone (m = 5.0 Kg) is tied to the free end of the string, as shown in figure below. When the system is released from rest, you determine that the stone acceleration is 2.0 m/s2. What is the mass (M) of the cylinder?

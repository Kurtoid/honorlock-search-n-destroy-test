Body color of wiggly worms is determined by the alleles B and b.        B = brown   b = tan A first generation population of wiggly worms living in the forest consists of 26 homozygous dominant (BB) brown worms, 46 heterozygous brown worms (Bb) and 28 tan worms (bb). After the population was counted for the first time, the forest was destroyed but the population of worms survived.  The sixth generation of worms consisted of 5 homozygous dominant brown worms, 32 heterozygous worms and 63 tan worms. For the next six generations the land stayed barren.  The twelfth generation of worms consisted of 4 homozygous dominant worms, 36 heterozygous worms and 62 tan worms.

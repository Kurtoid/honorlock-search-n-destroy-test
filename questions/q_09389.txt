Name three things you have learned (so far) in INSY 3021 that you believe will help you in your career as an industrial engineer. Explain why these are important.
Dispatch: You are called to FSU's Engineering Lab reference a 19 y/o male patient who has suffered from a burn injury.   Background Info.: Upon arrival, you find the patient outside next to a group of people who are standing in front of the entrance and waving you down. They tell you they were having an end-of-the-semester picnic and and were cooking burgers and hotdogs over a charcoal grill when the patient tripped while carrying something, knocked the grill over, and landed on the hot coals. The patient is sitting down visibly distressed, crying, and groaning that he is in extreme pain. From what you can tell, he appears to have burns on both of his hands and forearms and the front of his t-shirt. His arms appear to be a mixture of red burn marks and black smudge from charcoal. Additional Info.: You complete your primary assessment & scene-size up and determine that the scene is safe, you have one patient, and have considered there is a potential need to call the fire department as well as EMS for this patient. You have put on gloves for PPE. MOI is a fall/burn injury at this time, that the patient is Alert, his Airway is open, he's breathing at a rapid but regular rate, taking adequate breaths that are unlabored. You are unable to assess his radial pulse due to the pain from the burn injuries, but you assess his carotid pulse and it is rapid, strong and regular in rhythm. You don't observe any uncontrolled bleeding at this time.  Q3: What patient priority would you assign to this patient based on the information above and why? Q4: Would you consider this a significant or a non-significant MOI and why?  Q5: Based on the flowchart from Ch. 13, what are the general steps of assessment/treatment you will need to perform during your patient interaction until EMS arrives and takes over patient care? (Do not need to describe each step in detail - just complete the appropriate flow chart path from this point on)

The corrected endurance limit is 162.73 N/mm2. Also, the fatigue stress concentration factor is given as 1.7. Determine the diameter of the shaft, d, in the section of AB by using Goodman line.    Write down the obtained diameter. [answer_d]
Naylor and colleagues (2004) studied the use of a transitional care intervention provided by advanced practice nurses for elderly patients hospitalized with heart failure. They randomly assigned some patients to receive the transitional care intervention (intervention group) and other patients to receive standard care (control group) and they compared rehospitalization rates of each group. In this study, what was the dependent variable?
Bill, a 30 year old patient, presents to the office for routine dental hygiene therapy.  Bill has always reported that he has had seizures.  This visit he indicates that he has been having a seizure about once a week.  Since his seizures have been happening more frequently, his doctor has put him on phenytoin.  The dental hygienist asks Bill about his seizures and he states that he usually notices very strong smells before his seizures.  His seizures usually hast about 10 seconds, he loses consciousness, and usually his eyelids twitch.  He comes out of it quickly and usually does not remember what has happened.  During the intraoral exam the dental hygienist notes that the gingiva in the upper anterior interdental area is enlarged and is somewhat fibrotic.  Bill says he has noticed it but it is not painful. What type of seizures does Bill describe?

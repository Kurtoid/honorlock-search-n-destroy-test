This question has five parts, make sure you answer all of them. Assume that acid rain has lowered the pH of a lake to pH 4.0.  Why do you think this is called "acid" rain? What is the hydrogen ion concentration of this lake at pH 4.0? What is the hydroxide ion concentration of this lake at pH 4.0? If you wanted to return the pH of the lake back to a pH of 7.0, would you have to increase or decrease the amount of hydrogen ions in the lake? By how much would you have to increase/decrease hydrogen ion concentration to get it back to a pH of 7?
The U.S. Department of Agriculture claims that Idaho produces a lower potato yield than Nevada. Potato yield is measured in hundreds of pounds (cwt) per acre.  A random sample of 24 plots of potatoes from Idaho gave the mean yield of 350.1 cwt with the standard deviation of 34.6 cwt.  An independent random sample of 21 plots from Nevada produced the average of 383.4 cwt with the standard deviation of 37.2 cwt.  At 5% significance level, what is the appropriate conclusion?  You may assume that potato yields from both are normally distributed. Which of the following is the proper alternative hypothesis?

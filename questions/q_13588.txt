QUESTION 5         A student uses this apparatus to investigate how the current in an LDR (light-dependent resistor) varies with the intensity of light.    Right click on the button to open a diagram of the apparatus in a new window.    The student measures the current for a range of different intensities of light.      5.1   State why the student takes her readings in a dark room.   (1)     5.2   The table lists three types of variables. Copy and complete the table by giving an example of each type of variable for this investigation.   Right click on the button to open the table in a new window.     (3)                       The table shows her results.   Right click on the button to open the table of results in a new window.           5.3   One of her readings of current is anomalous.  Which reading is the anomalous reading in the table?   (1)     5.4   Calculate the correct average current for the distance that has the anomalous reading.   (1)     5.5   Plot a graph of the results and draw a curve of best fit.   (5)     5.6   Describe the relationship between distance and current.   (2)     5.7   State what happens to the resistance of an LDR when the intensity of light increases.   (1)     5.8   The student repeats her investigation, but this time covers the LDR with a thin sheet of tracing paper.  Explain how the curve of best fit would change.   (2)
Below is a T-DNA strand. List EACH sequence with A DASH (NO Spaces) between each DNA/RNA or amino acid triplet (example: AAU-GGC-CUA and ALA-PHE-GLY). Use all capital letters or Canvas may "Spell Correct" it. After listing the DNA/RNA/AA sequences, determine the new codon and amino acid that would be produced if there is a base substitution at the 7th nucleotide. The mutation substitutes the Complementary Base for the original nucleotide in your T-DNA.

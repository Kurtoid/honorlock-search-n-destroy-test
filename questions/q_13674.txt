With songs such as "Where Have All the Flowers Gone?" and "What Have They Done to the Rain?" folk singers protested war and radioactive fallout.  Bob Dylan became the leader of folk protest.  His challenging musical poetry spoke of war, bigotry, and injustice.               Dylan and other folk singers expressed the sentiments of a "counterculture."  Participants in the counterculture rejected what they considered "dehumanizing" careers with large corporations and sought other paths to personal fulfillment.

Dance crazes like the Twist, the Monkey, the Mashed Potato, and the Frug spawned musical styles of their own.

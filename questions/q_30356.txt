Questions 1-4 refer to the following passage: We are a young people. We inhabit a world apart, separated by broad seas. We are young in the ways of almost all the arts and sciences, although, in a certain manner, we are old in the ways of civilized society. I look upon the present state of America as similar to that of Rome after its fall. Each part of Rome adopted a political system conforming to its interest and situation or was led by the individual ambitions of certain chiefs, dynasties, or associations. But this important difference exists: those dispersed parts later reestablished their ancient nations, subject to the changes imposed by circumstances or extent. But we scarcely retain a vestige of what once was; we are, moreover, neither Indian nor European, but a species midway between the legitimate proprietors of this country and the Spanish usurpers. In short, although Americans by birth we derive our rights from Europe, and we have to assert these rights against the rights of the natives, and at the same time we must defend ourselves against the invaders. This places us in a most extraordinary and involved situation. . . . The role of the inhabitants of the American hemisphere has for centuries been purely passive. Politically they were nonexistent. We are still in a position lower than slavery, and therefore it is more difficult for us to rise to the enjoyment of freedom. . . . States are slaves because of either the nature or the misuse of their constitutions; a people is therefore enslaved when the government, by its nature or its vices, infringes on and usurps the rights of the citizen or subject. Applying these principles, we find that America was denied not only its freedom but even an active and effective tyranny. . . . We have been harassed by a conduct which has not only deprived us of our rights but has kept us in a sort of permanent infancy with regard to public affairs. --Simon Bolivar, Jamaica Letter, 1815 What other nation's actions inspired and influenced the ideas that Simon Bolivar highlighted in the passage?

The volume (V) of liquid in a spherical tank of radius r is related to the depth h of the liquid by    On the "Exam2-Q4" tab, we have four spherical tanks, with different r and h values. Write a VBA program that (1) evaluate the liquid volume for each spherical tank, and (2) calculate the total liquid volume (Vt) for all four tanks. This VBA program should contain either a FUNCTION or a SUBROUTINE "volume" below your main program that evaluates the volume V. You can use "pi" to represent "p" in your code. The code/formulas should be written such that values in blue change correctly if the values in yellow change and the code is re-executed. You can come back to this question if you have difficulties in coding. Note: (1) You must use either a function or a subroutine to get full credit for this question; and (2) If you cannot get your code to work, you may work this problem using a normal VBA code without a function/subroutine or spreadsheet formulas for partial credits. Please clearly note on the spreadsheet if you're choosing the formula option.  Once complete, please type a one-word essay (e.g., "ok") for this question and then upload your combined Excel file at the very end of this exam.

On March 1, Delta contracted to sell 500 metric tons of corn to Echo, for delivery at Echo's place of business on June 1. They each executed a written agreement, which included a merger clause and a no-oral-modification (NOM) clause (together, a "zipper clause"). On April 15, the Delta sales manager telephoned the Echo purchasing manager and stated, "a drought has seriously affected some of my suppliers, and I am uncertain whether I will be able to deliver on time. Any help you can give me in extending the delivery date to July 1 would be very much appreciated." The Echo purchasing manager agreed on the phone to change the delivery date to July 1, as requested. Echo's President was furious when she heard this and demanded that the purchasing manager tell Delta the corn must be delivered by June 1. The purchasing manager telephoned the Delta sales manager on April 16 saying "I can't extend after all--you'll have to deliver on June 1, or I can't accept delivery." Is Echo entitled to enforce the original June 1 delivery date?

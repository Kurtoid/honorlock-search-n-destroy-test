An editor wrote the following response and rejected the paper: "Your data are very interesting, but it is highly likely that your experiment is under-powered and may have led you to the wrong conclusion."   What did the editor mean by this statement?      Note & Hint: This is likely a little new to you, but you should be able to figure it out based on what we've discussed on the accepting and rejecting the hypothesis. Simply put: Type I error means rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true; a Type II error means failing to reject the null hypothesis when it's actually false. We'll learn more about error types in Module 2.

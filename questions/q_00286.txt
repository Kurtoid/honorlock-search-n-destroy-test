Orphy chatted with another visitor in the park (a fascinating fellow hermit named Gazebo T. Schmedlapp) about how Kary Mullis' PCR worked, and how amplification of a selected DNA fragment produces so many of that target sequence that it swamps out the rest of the DNA.  Help Orphy convince Gazebo of his rationale by calculating the following.  Turn in your work for problems 3 - 6 if you want partial credit! If the selected DNA fragment (target sequence) contains 3000 base pairs (bp) and the total genome size is 3 x 109 bp, prior to amplification, what fraction of the total DNA does the target sequence constitute?

The average time fill a prescription at a certain pharmacy is 8 minutes. The standard deviation of this distribution is 3.4 minutes.  A certain prescription took 9.36 minutes to be filled.  Find the z-score for this particular prescription refill. What does it mean in this instance?    The z-score is [firsta]. This means that the time for this prescription to be filled is [way] standard deviations [big] the mean.

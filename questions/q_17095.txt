A board member has one minute and asks you to describe your strategy as the new General Manager (GM) of a hotel in Bermuda. Using the information provided, craft a strategic narrative (e.g., radio spot, elevator speech) that is clear, concise, and compelling. Your narrative should be 1 minute, but no longer. You do not need to use every detail provided. You have 15 minutes to prepare, be sure to practice a few times before you record the narrative. Introduction: You work in the hospitality industry as the General Manager (GM) for a beautiful hotel in Bermuda, called Paradise Hotel--one of several hotels on the island. You occupy a prime spot on the corner of the island. Your hotel has not performed very well in the past (40-50% occupancy on average), despite its fine location, and you were hired a few months ago to help turn things around. You believe you can get and keep occupancy above 80%. Target Market:  You will be targeting fairly wealthy leisure vacationers from the Eastern United States. The existing market segmentation from before your time seems to be spot on and you feel you are targeting the right audience.     Competitive Advantage:  The island of Bermuda boasts some of the best beaches in the world. It attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year, and has a great reputation. Your hotel occupies a beautiful spot on the island (one of the best), and the rooms are spread out geographically across the coast, giving the feeling of exclusiveness. The hotel has its own private beach in a lagoon, a small swimming pool, a driving range, two restaurants, and other amenities. You have a plan to remodel and modernize the hotel rooms within the next twelve months. The new rooms will allow you to fill the rooms at a higher price. This investment will be amortized over 5 years, but you will see a return on investment within two years.    Marketing:  The overall positioning and messaging of your hotel has not been memorable or catchy. As part of a new campaign, you will position the hotel as "the finest hotel in the most beautiful part of the world." Your marketing director has developed a solid social media and digital advertising channel mix that is promising. The rate at which you attract repeat customers has been lower than the industry average, but you plan to run a novel loyalty program    People and Operations:  You have a strong group of executives and are pleased with the other staff you have interacted with. The problems with the hotel do not seem related to the staff. You will roll out a new compensation plans for the key staff members that ties bonuses to financial performance. You have learning and development plans to improve the skills of the staff members, and the overall culture. You are investing in some new software that will help information flow better.

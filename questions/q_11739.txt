In Homework 3 we calculated the amount of energy released by one fusion reaction of the triple alpha process. This process fuses together 3 helium atoms into 1 carbon atom. And it releases energy in the process.  We also calculated how many reactions/second this was based upon the total luminosity of one of these stars.   Why is this last calculation wrong?

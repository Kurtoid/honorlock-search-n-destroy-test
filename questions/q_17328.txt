Round percentages to one decimal point.  Round currency to dollars and cents.) Virtual Concepts, Inc. (VCI) manufactures a line of DVD recorders (DVRs) that are distributed to large retailers. The line consists of three models of DVRs. The following data is available regarding the models:    Model DVR SellingPrice per Unit VariableCost per Unit Demand/Year(units)   Model VC1 $635 $215 1,535   Model VC2 $450 $110 2,865   Model VC3 $350 $105 3,535   Model VC4 $435 $135 3,300      VCI is considering the addition of a fifth model to its line of DVRs. This model would be sold to retailers for $725. The variable cost of this unit is $315. The demand for the new Model LX 5 is estimated to be 2,000 units per year. Fifty percent of these unit sales of the new model is expected to come from other models already being manufactured by VCI (10 percent from Model VC1, 30 percent from VC2, 40 percent from Model VC3, and 20 percent from Model VC4). VCI will incur a fixed cost of $680,500 to add the new model to the line. Based on the preceding data, should VCI add the new Model LX5 to its line of DVRs? Why or Why not?

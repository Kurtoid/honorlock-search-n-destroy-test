Glucose filtered at the renal corpuscle is reclaimed in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) through tubular reabsorption.  This process is driven by the [protein]  which is located in the basal membrane of PCT cells.  The action of this transporter causes intracellular sodium concentration within the PCT cells to [change].  This change in the sodium concentration allows sodium to enter the PCT cell across the [membrane] through [protein2]. Kinetic energy associated with the movement of sodium ions through this transporter is used to move glucose into the cell against its gradient, increasing intracellular glucose concentration.  This allows glucose to leave the PCT cell across the [membrane2] through [protein3].

Reading Comprehension: Read the article below and answer the questions that follow.   The Real Rain Man   1    The 1988 movie Rain Man was a huge hit. The film starred two well-known American actors, Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman. In the movie, Cruise plays a selfish man named Charlie, who has not been in contact with his father for a long time. After the father dies, Charlie learns that his father has left millions of dollars to a brother that Charlie didn't know he had. The brother, named Raymond and played by Hoffman, has autism and is a savant, someone with exceptional mental abilities. The movie was very successful and won four Academy Awards. But it was also important because it was the first major movie that showed an individual with these conditions. 2    Hoffman won an Academy Award for the role. People felt that he showed how someone with these disorders would really behave. As Raymond, Hoffman exhibits many typically autistic behaviors such as repetitive movements and the obsessive following of routines. He also shows the exceptional abilities that a savant can have. With his extraordinary memory, he can list an amazing amount of information from the telephone book and about baseball. Hoffman prepared carefully for the role by meeting people with these conditions. He also had access to doctors who are experts in this area. 4    People enjoyed this movie. They appreciated the story, which showed how the two brothers developed real affection over time. But many didn't realize that the character of Raymond was based on a real person. The writer of the film had met a man named Kim Peek, who had savant syndrome but didn't have autism. 5    Peek had extraordinary abilities. In fact, he was called a "megasavant." He was born in 1951 with some brain problems. Doctors anticipated that Peek would be severely disabled and told his parents to put him in an institution. His parents decided to keep him at home. He was disabled, but his parents were amazed at how his learning accelerated. At sixteen months, Peek taught himself to read children's books. About two years later, when Peek was still a toddler, his parents realized that he was able to use a dictionary and read a newspaper. By the time he was seven Peek had memorized the Bible. 6    Peek went to school, but teachers sent him home for bad behavior. In the 1950s, U.S. schools weren't used to helping children with special needs. His parents ended up hiring retired teachers to teach Peek at home. Peek completed the high school curriculum by the time he was fourteen, but the authorities wouldn't give him a diploma. He could read a book in about an hour by reading two pages at a time. He read the left page with his left eye and the right page with his right eye. His pace was about eight seconds per page. And he remembered almost everything he ever read in a wide range of subjects, such as history, sports, geography, and music. People said that he could remember the contents of at least 12,000 books. 7    His physical skills were very limited because of his disability. He needed his parents' help for everyday activities such as dressing, shaving, and brushing his teeth. His social skills were also very limited. However, the release of Rain Man gave Peek publicity and helped his confidence. For the first time he made friends, and he became more confident. He and his father went on public speaking tours, striving to educate people about the need to treat all people equally. People had a lot of admiration for Peek when they got to know him. He was also finally awarded the high school diploma that he hadn't received when he was fourteen. 8    Some universities studied Peek as an adult. They confirmed that he was a genius in at least fifteen subjects. Most savants only acquire this status in only one or two subjects. Doctors were also surprised because his abilities improved as he got older, which is not typical. 9    Sadly, Peek died of a heart attack in December 2009, when he was only fifty- eight.

Consider the following reaction. M is a mystery metal.     MCO3(s)   -->    MO(s)   +   CO2(g) Thermodynamic data at 25@C:    Substance MCO3(s)  MO(s) CO2(g)   [?]Hf@298K in kJ/mol -1224. -593 -394   S@298K in J/mol K 95 57 214    A. Calculate the standard free energy at 1100.@C. Give this answer in decimal form. Use correct sig figs, and don't round until the end. [?]G@900@C = [g] with units [gu]   B. Now calculate the equilibrium constant at a temperature of 900.@C. Give this answer in E format. To make it easier, give your answer with 2 sig figs even if you think the correct number of sig figs is different. K = [k]   C. Is this reaction spontaneous under standard conditions at 900@C? Type yes or no. [spont]

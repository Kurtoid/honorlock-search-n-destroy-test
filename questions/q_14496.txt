Signalment (Age, breed, sex, reproductive status) and history (geographic region, complaints/presenting signs, animal environment/husbandry, prior treatment) are important in determining a list of differentials and to form a diagnostic plan. Read the 4 different case histories/signalments below and list the requested # of different parasites (use Genus or Genus/species where appropriate) that are suitable differentials for the cases provided. 2 points/case. Case 1) Mixed age dogs up to six months in kennel environment in Mobile, AL. Some with intermittent diarrhea. Dogs treated with pyrantel every 2 weeks since birth.

Owner reports blood in stool that is normal to soft-formed at times. List 2 parasite differentials for blood in relatively normal stool with no other apparent clinical signs.

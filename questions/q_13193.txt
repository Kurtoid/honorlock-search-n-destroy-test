EXERPT FROM 'THE OVERCOAT' by Nikolai Gogol When and how he entered the department, and who appointed him, no one could remember.  However much the directors and chiefs of all kinds were changed, he was always to be seen in the same place, the same attitude, the same occupation; so that it was afterwards affirmed that he had been born in undress uniform with a bald head.  No respect was shown him in the department.  The porter not only did not rise from his seat when he passed, but never even glanced at him, any more than if a fly had flown through the reception-room.  His superiors treated him in coolly despotic1 fashion.  Some sub-chief would thrust a paper under his nose without so much as saying, "Copy," or "Here's a nice interesting affair," or anything else agreeable, as is customary amongst well-bred officials.  And he took it, looking only at the paper and not observing who handed it to him, or whether he had the right to do so; simply took it, and set about copying it. The young officials laughed at and made fun of him, so far as their official with permitted; told in his presence various stories concocted about him, and about his landlady, an old woman of seventy; declared that she beat him; asked when the wedding was to be; and strewed bits of paper over his head, calling them snow.  But Akakiy Akakievitch answered not at word, any more than if there had been no one there besides himself.  It even had no effect upon his work; amid all these annoyances he never made a single mistake in a letter.  But I'd the joking became wholly unbearable, as when they jogged his hand and prevented his attending to his work, he would exclaim, "Leave me alone! Why do you insult me?" And there was something strange in the words and the voice in which they were uttered.  There was in it something which moved to pity; so much that one young man, a new comer, who, taking pattern by the others, had permitted himself to make sport of Akakiy, suddenly stopped short, as though all about him had undergone a transformation, and presented itself in a different aspect.  Some unseen force repelled him from the comrades whose acquaintance he had made on the supposition that they were well-bred and polite men.  Long afterwards, in his gayest moments, there recurred to his mind the little official with the bald forehead, with his heart-rending words, "Leave me alone! Why do you insult me?" In these moving words, other words resounded -- "I am thy brother." And the young man covered his face with his hand; and many a time afterwards, in the course of his life, shuddered at seeing how much inhumanity there is in man, how much savage coarseness is concealed beneath delicate, refined worldliness, and even in that man whom the world acknowledges as honourable and noble. It would be difficult to find another man who lived so entirely for his duties.  It is not enough to say that Akakiy laboured with zeal; no, he laboured with love.  In his copying, he found a varied and agreeable employment.  Enjoyment was written on his face: some letters were even favourites with him; and when he encountered these, he smiled, winked, and worked with his lips, till it seemed as though each letter might be read in his face, as his pen traced it.  If his pay had been in proportion to his zeal, he would, perhaps, to his great surprise, have been made even a councillor of state.  But he worked, as his companions, the wits, put it, like a horse in a mill. Moreover, it is impossible to say that no attention was paid to him.  One director being a kindly man, and desirous of rewarding him for his long service, ordered him to be given something more important than mere copying.  So he was ordered to make a report of an already concluded affair of another department: the duty consisting simply of changing the heading and altering a few words from the first to the third person.  This caused him so much toll that he broke into a perspiration, rubbed his forehead, and finally said, "No, give me rather something to copy."  After that they let him copy on forever.    As used in paragraph 3, what does the word "zeal" suggest about Akakiy?

The neurotransmitter and hormone norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, is involved in mobilizing brain and body for action and boosts alertness, but it can also increase restlessness and anxiety. Consider the structure of N-protonated norepinephrine (shown below) and answer the following questions.  The lowest-energy conformation of N-protonated norepinephrine is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and the ammonium group. Which of the following Newman projections (A-F) represents this conformation viewed through the C1-C2 bond? [conformation]  Recall that dihedral angles are measured clockwise when answering the next two questions. Consider the conformation of N-protonated norepinephrine in which the hydroxyl group and the ammonium group are eclipsed. What is the dihedral angle between aryl (Ar) substituent and ammonium group in this conformation? [dihedral1] What is the dihedral angle between the aryl (Ar) substituent and the ammonium group in Newman structure F? [dihedral2] Do Newman structures C and E represent conformational isomers? [isomers]

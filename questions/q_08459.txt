It Makes Your Mouth Water: Classical Conditioning In the early 1900s, research scientists were unhappy with psychology's focus on mental activity. Many were looking for a way to bring some kind of objectivity and scientific research to the field. It was a Russian physiologist (a person who studies the workings of the body) named Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936) who pioneered the empirical study of the basic principles of a particular kind of learning (Pavlov, 1906, 1926). Studying the digestive system in his dogs, Pavlov had built a device that would accurately measure the amount of saliva produced by the dogs when they were fed a measured amount of food. Normally, when food is placed in the mouth of any animal, the salivary glands automatically start releasing saliva to help with chewing and digestion. This is a normal reflex (involuntary response) in both animals and humans. The food causes the particular reaction of salivation. A stimulus can be defined as any object, event, or experience that causes a response, the reaction of an organism. In the case of Pavlov's dogs, the food is the stimulus and salivation is the response. Pavlov soon discovered that his dogs began salivating when they weren't supposed to be salivating. Some dogs would start salivating when they saw the lab assistant bringing their food, others when they were usually fed. Pavlov spent the rest of his career studying what eventually he termed classical conditioning, learning to make a reflex response to a stimulus other than the original, natural stimulus that normally produces it. 1.

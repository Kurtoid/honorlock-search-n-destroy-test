A particle with mass and charge m=7mp{"version":"1.1","math":"m=7mp"} and q=+3e{"version":"1.1","math":"q=+3e"} is accelerated from rest through a potential difference. Once it has passed through this region of space it enters a different region of space which contains a uniform magnetic field of 450 mT. When the particle moves in this magnetic field it moves in a circular path with an effective radius of 35.0 mm. What is the magnitude of potential difference that made this possible?

Identify all functional groups present. [Image ID: A three carbon chain presented vertically. The top carbon is bound to an oxygen ion, and double-bonded to another oxygen atom. The middle (second) carbon is bound to an oxygen, which is in turn bound to a phosphorous atom bound to two additional oxygen ions and double-bonded to a third oxygen atom. The third carbon is double-bonded to the second carbon, and is also bound to two hydrogen atoms.]

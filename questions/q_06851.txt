The mortgage lender quotes you a rate of 6.80% APR for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. The mortgage lender also tells you that if you are willing to pay two points, they can offer you a lower rate of 6.50% APR for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. One point is equal to 1% of the loan value. So if you take the lower rate and pay the points, you will need to borrow an additional $5200 to cover the points you are paying the lender. 1) What is your monthly mortgage payment if you pay the points and borrow from the mortgage lender at 6.50%? 2)  Given your calculation, should you pay two points to get a lower rate?

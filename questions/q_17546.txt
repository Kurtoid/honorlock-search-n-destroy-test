You need to calculate the qty of excavation for a structure your company will be building.  You do not have time to do a field survey, so you will use an existing contour map to determine the elevation of the ground at the 4 "pay limits" of your structure. You get a copy of the land development plans and get the contour lines from it (the subdivision was only just finished so you know the contour lines are accurate). You make a photo copy of the drawing showing your lot and the contour lines (red) and draw the building pay limits (blue) on it (shown below):    What existing elevation value would you use for the lower right corner of the excavation (please select the answer that is closet to the correct answer)?

Wingardic acid is a madeup monoprotic acid that has a Ka of 5.7x10-6. Consider the titration of 36.00 mL of 0.420 M wingardic acid with 0.560 M NaOH. Note that the concentrations are not the same. Make sure sig figs are correct on your answers. Don't round until the end. Show your work on your upload for full credit. As usual, work should follow examples as in lecture, showing BRA and/or ICE tables if appropriate and any assumptions you are making. You can use a generic HA for the acid formula. A.

The equivalence point will be at ______ mL of titrant added and have a pH of ______? vol titrant = [v2] mL pH = [ph2] C.  What is the pH at the point when 30.5 mL of titrant are added? pH = [ph3]

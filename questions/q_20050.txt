Use the following code for questions 39 - 41.  The product method will take an object of type ArrayList as the only parameter, and the name of this list will be numbers. The method will return the product of all the parameter numbers. For example, if numbers contained Integer objects with values 1, 2, 3, 4 the method would return 24. Remember, type Integer objects are automatically converted to type int during expression evaluation or assignment.  What belongs in blank __b1__?

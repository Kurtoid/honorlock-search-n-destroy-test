18. Suppose that we have three database operations: Q1, Q2, and I. The number of accessing database for each operation is illustrated as follows. For example, if no index is built, we need to access our database 10 times to execute Q1; if we build an index on the attribute star, we need to access our database 4 times to execute Q1. We assume that the fraction of time we do Q1 is p1; the fraction of the time we do Q2 is p2, and the fraction of the time we do I: 1- p1- p2.    Action No index Star index  Movie index  Both indexes    Q1 10 4 10 4   Q2 10 10 4 4   I 2 4 4 6    (1) If p1 = 0.3, p2 = 0.3, what is the best index to create? (Hint you can four options: no index, star index, movie index and both indexes) (7 points) (2) If p1 = 0.2, p2 = 0.1, what is the best index to create? (7 points)

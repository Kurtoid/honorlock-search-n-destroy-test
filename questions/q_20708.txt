A sample of polystyrene was fractionated from its solution. The weight percent (based on the weight of the entire sample) and the molecular weight (g/mole) of successive fractions were as follows:        Fraction Number   Weight (%)   Molecular Weight (g/mol)     1   5   7500     2   10   17600     3   16   38000     4   19   74000     5   23   143000     6   15   259000     7   9   452000     8   3   1057000       Assuming that the fractions are essentially monodisperse, calculate Mw, Mn, and polydispersity of the polystyrene sample.

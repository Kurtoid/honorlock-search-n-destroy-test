Questions from reading assignments (a) The paper "DAPPER: Data Aware Approximate NoC for GPGPU Architectures" describes an approach for designing energy-efficient NoCs. Briefly describe the ideas proposed as part of the DAPPER framework (for both software and hardware components) that contribute to energy minimization. (b) The paper "A Domain-Specific Architecture for Deep Neural Networks" describes domain specific architectures, and discusses Google's TPU. Describe how Google's TPU architecture differs from conventional CPU architectures (such as the 5 stage pipelined MIPS architecture we have discussed in this course). How specifically do these differences help software run faster on the TPU? (c) The paper "Memory Scaling: A Systems Architecture Perspective" discusses many challenges and potential solutions for DRAM scaling. Briefly describe at least one technique each to (i) reduce DRAM refresh overhead, (ii) improve DRAM access parallelism, and (iii) reduce DRAM power consumption.

Admiral Industries commenced operations in January 20Y1 and prepays two expenses during 20Y1. On April 1, Admiral pays a $90,000 premium for an insurance policy that covers the 12-month period ending March 31, 20Y2. On November 1, Admiral pays $75,000 for an advertising campaign that covers the 6-month period ending April 30, 20Y2. Admiral's accountant correctly accounts for the prepaid expenses when preparing the income statement and balance sheet for 20Y1. However, when using the indirect method to prepare the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows for 20Y1, the accountant forgets to make adjustments for the effects of two prepaid expenses. Unless these errors are corrected, the net cash provided by operating activities for 20Y1 will be:

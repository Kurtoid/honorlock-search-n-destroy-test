When she arrived at the cancer treatment center for her latest round of chemotherapy, she let the nurse know that she thought the infection was back once again. Signs and Symptoms The nurse asked Trudy to describe her symptoms. She reported having a persistent "full bladder" feeling that didn't go away after voiding, and that she thought she had a fever. The nurse confirmed that Trudy did have a low-grade fever.  Testing The nurse also tested Trudy's urine with a urine dipstick, and sent a sample to the microbiology lab for culture.

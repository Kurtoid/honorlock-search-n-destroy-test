Mannitol salt agar (MSA) is _____________________________.
A primitive trait is a trait which is similar in both the ancestor and the descendant. This is the opposite of a _________ trait which is a trait that has newly emerged in the descendant and is not found in the ancestor. The grasping hands with nails found in Eocene primates of 55 million years ago represent a ______  trait when compared to the non-grasping hands with claws found in early mammals of 200 million years ago (Mya).  [Note:  The same word is used for both blanks] Matt Cartmill proposed that the earliest primates used their grasping hands and stereoscopic vision to harvest and feed on insects.  All contemporary primates (including humans) still use well-developed _________ coordination to grasp and bring food to the mouth.  In contrast, most mammals bring their mouth to the food (e.g. dogs, cats, horses, porpoises, etc.). All hominoids show adaptations for ___________ including long muscular arms, a shoulder joint with 360 degree rotation, a fully extendable elbow, 180 degree forearm rotation and an increase is side-to-side wrist motion. Humans are hominoids and have all of these adaptations. Brain tissue is energetically expensive. In the human brain, the large amount of cortical tissue devoted to controlling ________movements suggests that this hand digit is very critical to the human way of life. The emergence of vertebrates (and the successive evolution of bony fish, amphibians and early reptiles) can be seen in the fossil record of the Paleozoic Era. This time interval ends with the largest ___________event in the history of life on this earth. Mammals with four different kinds of teeth for food processing make their first appearance more than 200 million years ago in the Mesozoic Era. However, it is not until the __________ Era (which begins 65 million years ago) that mammals radiate into the 28 distinctively different orders of modern mammals that are found today.  During the Eocene, the widely distributed Adapiformes (including Smilodectes) are true______ with grasping hands and forward-facing eyes. This suggests that eye-hand coordination was as important in this 55 million-year-old taxon as it is among the contemporary members of the order.   Most of the fossil apes of the Miocene did not show adaptation for a suspensory way of life (something that is characteristic of all modern apes such as gibbons, chimpanzees and gorillas). Nevertheless, paleoanthropologists recognize these primates as early apes because they all possessed a ________ (something never found in modern monkeys). A _______ is any species on the lineage leading to modern humans after the split from the common ancestor that humans share with chimpanzees. Paleoanthropologists often search for fossils in places where sediments of the right age are subject to erosion and the fossils embedded in these sediments are exposed and lay on the surface. ________ is a fossil cranium (and possible early hominin) that was discovered on the desert surface at a site in northern Chad.  This site also contains many animal fossils which are 6-7 million years old. In the 4.4 million-year-old ________skeleton found in Ethiopia, long legs and fully extendable hips and knees suggest that bipedalism was the primary form of terrestrial locomotion in this species.  However, the opposable big toe suggests that the bipedalism of this hominin species is not the efficient striding bipedalism found in modern humans.

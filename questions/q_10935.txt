A planet has a mass that is 5.50 times the mass of the Earth. It has a radius 2.25 times larger than Earth's radius. The planet's orbit is 16 times greater than the Earth's orbit. The time it takes the planet to orbit it's star is 36 of our years. Assume the orbits are circular. (a) What is the mass of this planet's star compared to our star. Your answer should be a number multiplied by MS{"version":"1.1","math":"MS"} where MS{"version":"1.1","math":"MS"} is the mass of Earth's Sun, e.g.12.4MS{"version":"1.1","math":"12.4MS"} or0.124MS{"version":"1.1","math":"0.124MS"}. (11 points) (b) A person on the surface of Earth has a potential energy of 4.53x109{"version":"1.1","math":"4.53x109"} J or -4.53 GJ. What is the potential energy this person would have on the surface of this planet? You should not assume the near Earth approximation for potential energy is valid. (11 points)

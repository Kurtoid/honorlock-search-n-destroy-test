In exchange for a share of the profits, a woman conveyed her densely forested tract of land to a logging company by warranty deed. The logging company did not record its deed. Afraid her friends and family would think she made a bad business decision, the woman kept the transaction with the logging company to herself. Prior to felling any trees, the logging company abandoned its project and returned the deed to the woman. Then, in exchange for half the tract's market value, the woman executed and delivered a quitclaim deed to the tract to her friend. The friend intended to record the deed but forgot. Subsequently, the logging company decided to proceed with its original logging project on the land. The jurisdiction has the following recording act:     A conveyance of an interest in land shall not be valid against any subsequent    purchaser for value, without notice thereof, unless the conveyance is recorded.    In a suit between the logging company and the friend to quiet title, who is likely to prevail?

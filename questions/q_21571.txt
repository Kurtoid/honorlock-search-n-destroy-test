Joseph Priestley conducted a series of experiments in 1771 to understand how plants grow. He first placed an unlit candle inside a sealed bell jar and lit the wick with a converging lens.  After a few minutes, the flame went out and could not be relit, even when left in the sun for 2 days.  In his next experiment, Priestley changed just one variable in the original experiment by adding a sprig of mint into the bell jar along with the candle.  He again lit the candle using the converging lens, and the candle burned out after a few minutes.  Two days later he was able to relight the candle without lifting the jar.  What did the result demonstrate?
9. Consider a drive-through ATM that is modeled by an M/M/1 (single-channel model with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times) queuing system where the average inter-arrival time is 75 seconds and the average service time is 50 seconds per customer. What is the probability (to four decimal places) that the number of cars in the system will be between 2 and 5 (inclusive - i.e., include the endpoints of this interval)? Show all work.

In a telephone conversation, a jewelry maker offered to buy 100 ounces of gold from a precious metals company if delivery could be made within 10 days.

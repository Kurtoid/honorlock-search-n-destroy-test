A researcher wants to determine the minimum sample size needed in order to construct a 95% confidence interval estimate for the proportion of high school seniors in a certain state who plan to attend college after graduation. Past studies have indicated that this proportion is approximately .75.   Complete the following:  For 95% confidence, the z-score to be used in computing the minimum sample size is [z]. If the researcher uses the initial estimate p*=.75 in her calculation, then she will use q*=[q]. If the researcher wants her confidence interval to have a maximum error of .04, then the minimum sample size needed will be [n1]. If the researcher wants her confidence interval to have a maximum error of .03, then the minimum sample size needed will be [n2].

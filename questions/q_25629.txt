PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left testicular torsion POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left testicular torsion PROCEDURES PERFORMED:1. Bilateral scrotal exploration2. Bilateral orchiopexy INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 15-year-old gentleman who presented after hewoke up this morning with complaint of left scrotal pain. He was seen in emergency department, andonce we were consulted and after evaluating him emergently, we took him to the operating room forscrotal exploration and and orchiopexies. I discussed with the patient and his mother the risks,benefits, potential complications, and alternatives of the procedure. She verbalized understanding andgave an informed consent.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was identified in the holding area by name and medicalrecord number and then taken back to operating suite, where he was placed in supine position. Allappropriate monitoring lines were placed. General anesthesia was induced without any difficulty. Thearea was then prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. To start the procedure, an anteriortransverse incision was made overlying the left scrotum, and this was carried down through the dartosfascia, down to the tunica vaginalis. At this point, the testicle and cord were delivered through theincision, and then the patient was noted to have essentially a 180- to 360-degree torsion with the testiclenoted to be dark and hard. Once the tunica vaginalis was opened, the testicle was noted to be dark, andthen I started investigating the anatomic structures. Of note, the patient's scrotum did not have a definedepididymal head, and I could not feel the vas join into the testicle. After examiningthe testicle, we proceeded to wrap this in warm gauze, and then I turned my attention to the righthemiscrotum. Again another transverse incision was made and carried down to the dartos. I then deliveredthe testicle on this side. This side was normal. Then a pexing stitch was placed through the dartos withoutbutton-holing the skin. Once this was done on both sides, it was also placed through tunica albuginea ofthe testicle. The testicle was then carefully replaced back into the sac with maintaining the lateral sulcuslateral and ensuring that the cord had no twisting. Once the testicle was placed in the sac, the sutures weretied down, then the dartos was closed with a 3-0 chromic suture, and the skin was closed with 4-0Monocryl suture placed in subcuticular fashion. After this side was done, we waited and then essentially Iconsulted with the doctor who was originally consulted about this patient's case, he advised to incise thetunica albuginea to examine the tubules, and if the tubules are seen to be viable, then proceed to save thetesticle. It looked as if portions of it were viable. I made an incision on the tunica albuginea,  over the areas that looked viable, and then exposed the tubules and noted that it was tan-colored  and looked as if it was viable.  At that point, I decided to proceed with saving this side. I closed the incision with a 5-0 chromic suture in a figure-of-eight fashion and then proceeded to pex this side in the same fashion as the otherside. Once the apexion was completed, again the dartos was closed with 3-0 chromic suture and the skinwas closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture placed in subcuticular fashion. After this was done, local anesthesiawas applied to the skin and then Dermabond was also applied to the skin. A fluff dressing as well asscrotal support was placed, and then at this point the procedure was then complete. The patient was thenawoken and transferred back to the post anesthesia care unit, where he continued to recover without anydifficulty.

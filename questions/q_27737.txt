Question 2 You have been hired to analyze the performance of the athletes participating in a regional sprint triathlon. For this initial analysis, the events are considered in pairs, and you are starting with running and swimming.  Each swimmer is given a score based on their times, where a higher score indicates a better performance (or lower completion time). The joint pmf of the scores for running and swimming is given below.     Swimming/Running   3   6   9   12         5   0.10   0.15   0.05   0.05         10   0.05   0.05   0.20   0.05         15   0.03   0.07   0.10   0.10                                     c) What is the correlation between swimming and running scores?

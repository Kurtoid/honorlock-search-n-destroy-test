Dr. He You are working on the infectious disease consultation team in your hospital. As a part of today's consolation, you are asked to evaluate and make recommendations for antimicrobial therapy on a patient. The patient, DL, is a 47 you man with history of a low cervical spinal cord injury, as a result of a diving accident at the age of 17. He is a paraplegic and has chronic indwelling Foley catheter which drains urine from his bladder. As a result, he has developed recurrent urinary tract infections over the past 10 years. He is readmitted to the hospital with high fever and presumed pyelonephritis yesterday. The preliminary results of his admission urine culture have returned this morning and show greater than 100,000 colonies of gram negative bacillus, confirming a UTI. You review Mr. L's urine analyses from prior admissions and find multiple infections with gram-negative species that were resistant to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, sulfonamides, tetracycline, doxycycline and chloramphenicol.   Many antimicrobials exert their action at sites or within processes, which are unique to the DNA replication of prokaryotic cells. This confers a degree of selectivity to these agents, which should limit potential adverse effects in humans. Which of the following statements regarding the selectivity of an antimicrobial drug and its adverse effects is correct?

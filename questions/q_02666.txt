Mark is the project manager working for a general contractor to construct commercial buildings. His team only has the ability to work for a single project at one time. Now, there are 3 competing projects under his considerations. Financial analysis reflects the following information:    Project Riverside Commercials: the payback period is 12 months, and the NPV is $1,580,000; Project Potomac Greenland: A 3-year project. The real rate is 0.15, and the inflation rate is 0.1, with no risk premium. The initial investment is $3,000,000. The expected net cash inflows are $2,000,000; $2,500,000; and $3,000,000.  Project Campus Center: the payback period is 30 months, and the NPV is $1,800,000.    Which project would you recommend to Mark?

Figure 1. Since 1972, Dr. Jim Estes had been studying a food chain of kelp -> urchins -> sea otters, and then in the early1990s orcas began eating the sea otters. The data collected by Dr. Estes are shown. Panel A shows sea otter abundancearound four different islands from 1972 to 1997. Panel B shows the amount of sea urchins (sea urchin biomass) in 1987and 1997. Panel C shows the amount of kelp that sea urchins ate over a 24-hour period (grazing intensity) in 1991 and1997. Panel D shows the number of kelp plants within a specific area (density of kelp) in 1987 and 1997. The thickness ofthe arrows illustrates the strength of the effect one species has on the species below it in the food web Complete the following sentence. Figure 1 illustrates that when killer whales started eating sea otters, the sea otter population ___________________, the urchin population ______________________, and the kelp population_____________________________.

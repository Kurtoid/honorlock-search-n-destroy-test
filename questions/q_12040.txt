Alice is an African-American 13 year-old-girl. She lives in a lower-SES community with her single mother Sarah. Alice is an only child and Sarah wants the best education possible for her daughter. Therefore Sarah had Alice transfer to a new school in a better area, but Alice now has to take a bus over 1.5 hours per day, each way.  She comes to school tired often because she has to be up by 5am to get to her bus stop at 6 am.  Her bus stop is across the street from a known drug dealer's home, resulting in a significant amount of fear and anxiety in both the mornings and the evenings. Her teachers have observed the following about Alice:  Alice received straight A's at her previous school. She is a polite and respectful student who tries hard, which was reflected in her grades. She has significant academic deficits in all areas. Some of these deficits stem from her difficulty with reading comprehension. She often misinterprets assignments and instructions given. Therefore, although she usually completes her class work and homework, it is often incorrect, or even off topic completely. In mathematics, she tends to need manipulatives to complete her math work. She also struggles with scientific experimentation. While she can often make accurate observations, she struggles to make hypotheses about those observations.  However, Alice loves photography and art and has been given the opportunity to participate in the school yearbook. She wants to be successful, but is overwhelmed by the new higher academic standards in her new school.

Professor Winfrey developed an instrument to measure the Perceived Campus Safety for Sexual and Gender Minorities Scale (CSSGM)  As a first step, Professor Winfrey asked a panel of women and gender studies faculty, campus LGBTQ+ activists, and staff from the University's Dean of Students office to scrutinize the scale. This panel was  and address the question of whether several dimensions of perceived campus safety are adequately operationalized in this scale: available LGBTQ-specific resources and supports; climate of affirmation and acceptance; comprehensive approach to LGBTQ+ sexual assault prevention and intervention; and affirmative campus policies. Dr. Winfrey received feedback about the scale, made modifications and received further feedback until the panel unanimously agreed that the scale is accurate and comprehensive. Professor Winfrey and their  research assistants recruited students who self-identify as LGBTQ from a variety of campus organizations, UHS, and social media and asked a sample of 206 undergraduate students to participate in a study using the CSSGM. In a study report, Dr. Winfrey reported on their findings. A month after administering the CSSGM, 98 of the participants completed the CSSGM  again, and the correlation (Pearson's r) between the scores on the two administrations of the new CICRA instrument was .52 (p

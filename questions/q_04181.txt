The Vietnam War
Section II  This question is like your Inquiry Midterm Exam, but this time you'll use all of ATF and all its images.  If you completed the Extra Credit assignment about the images of John Brown, you're that much more ahead!  For this exam question, consider the role that imagery plays in our understanding of the past.  Images appear throughout ATF, and the authors often caption them by noting what each one conveys, not just portrays.  Using at least 5 images (you may use more if you like) from across 5 different ATF chapters (you can mix and match, but 5 chapters must be represented), explore the impact of imagery not on those who lived it the first time, but on us looking backward.  Think of it this way-if all you knew of American History from 1491 to 1877 was what you saw in these images, what would you have learned?  Your essay should be 800-1000 words long, coherent, and thoughtful.  As with all work for this class, I expect to see ample detail and attention to the documentary evidence.

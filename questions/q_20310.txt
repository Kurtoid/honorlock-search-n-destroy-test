QUESTION 16 A 12-ft long cantilever beam with the shown cross section is subjected to a total factored load of 2.115 k/ft. The equation of moment (in k-ft) is M(x)=-1.0575x2+25.38x-152.28 where x (in ft) is the distance measured from the support. Note that this equation has been derived based on positive sign convention for M(x), i.e., compression on top fiber and tension on bottom fiber. The beam is reinforced with 6 No. 6 uncoated Gr. 60 longitudinal bars and No. 4 Gr. 60 U-shaped stirrups. The cover to stirrup is 1.5 in.  Concrete compressive strength is 5,000 psi.        Note: The actual dimensions of stirrup are shown, but the calculations are the same as what we've done throughout the class by showing the stirrups as lines. Using the simplified equations, the development length of No. 6 longitudinal bars is nearly
Anika's boss tells off-color jokes and tolerates male employees directing sexually based teasing toward women employees. When she complains, he tells her to lighten up--they're just joking. This is an example of
The following figure reflects the results of a study by Brunoni et al. (2006) that investigated whether the combination of low-level electrical brain stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and sertraline, a commonly used SSRI antidepressant, would be effective in ameliorating depression in a group of clinically depressed individuals. The researchers randomly assigned participants to one of two medication conditions (placebo or sertraline) and to one of two brain electrical stimulation conditions (sham tDCS or active tDCS). Participants' levels of depression was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) after six weeks of treatment.Figure: Brain Stimulation and Medication Reference: Ref 14-5 (Figure: Brain Stimulation and Medication) Based on the figure, which effects appear to be present?
The opioid antagonist drug is
At ImaginX, a call center, it takes an employee time to fill out a required form with each call.  The time to complete this form is known to be exponentially distributed with a population mean of [x] minutes.  This copywritten question is part of a quiz or exam at Arizona State.  It may not be posted or reproduced without the permission of the author, Dr. L. Chattin, and Arizona State University.   Determine the probability that it takes an employee fewer than [y] minutes to complete this form.  Express your answer to four decimal places using conventional rounding methods.

In a coffee cup calorimeter, 200.0mL of 2.50M sodium hydroxide is added to 300.0mL of 2.00M nitric acid. All of the sodium hydroxide is reacted. The temperature increases from 21.5degC to 34.4degC.  Calculate the change in enthalpy of the reaction. (The specific heat of the solution is 3.99J/gdegC and the density of the solution is 1.08g/mL. Assume that the calorimeter absorbs a negligible amount of heat.)

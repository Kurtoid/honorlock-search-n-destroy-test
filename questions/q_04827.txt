Assume the market for computers in a small open economy (SOE) is given by the following:                         Demand:  x =  60,000 - 10P                                         Supply:  y = 30P - 20,000 a) Calculate the autarky price in the SOE and derive the equation for their import demand curve. If the world price of computers is equal to PW = 1,000, how many computers will they import. b)  If the SOE imposes a quota on computers such that imports are limited to Mbar = 20,000, how would this affect the price of computers in the SOE. Calculate the tariff equivalence of the quota and the change in welfare in the SOE due to the quota (compared with welfare under free trade).

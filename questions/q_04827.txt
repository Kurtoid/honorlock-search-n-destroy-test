Consider the following reaction: A(aq) + B(aq) -  C(aq) + D(aq) The initial rate of this reaction was determined for several concentrations of A  and B,  and the following rate data were obtained for the rate of disappearance of B:    What is the reaction rate when the initial concentration of A is 0.100 M and that of B is 0.25M if the temperature is the same as that used to obtain the data shown? (A) Rate = 5.42

A researcher will be using some calcium chloride solutions for an experiment. She has to prepare the solutions that are needed. The lab has a bottle containing a 2.75 M calcium chloride solution.  The researcher needs to make 250.0 mL of a 0.185 M calcium chloride solution. How many milliliters of the 2.75 M calcium chloride solution are needed to make 250.0 mL of a 0.185 M calcium chloride solution?   [Note: the molar mass of calcium chloride is 110.98 g/mol and the molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.]

A student is performing a cell count to determine the number of symbionts present in their sample. They determined a cell count of 123 symbionts using one big corner square of the haemocytometer. What is the symbiont count per mL? (1 big corner square has a volume of 0.1 mm3 ).    Using this standard curve, what is the concentration of a sample with an absorbance of 0.461?
Please briefly describe the differences between a closed system and a control volume from the points of view of mass and energy transfer. Note: Please type your answers to this question.

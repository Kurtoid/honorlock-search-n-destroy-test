When selecting evidence for your essay, secondary sources from established periodicals like Smithsonian and The Economist are best. The information found in books, journals and websites is always superior to your own observations, interviews, and reasoned ideas.
Essay questions: Please answer ONLY 3 of the 4 essay questions listed below. Your answers should be 2-3 paragraphs (~300-500 words) in length. Grading will be based on the clarity and thoroughness of your answers. Each question is worth 30 points.   1) Evaluate Piaget's view that cognitive development occurs in stages. Draw from material presented throughout the chapters on cognition and the various theories of cognitive development (and anything appropriate from additional chapter materials).   2) Describe three sources of evidence that support the role of nature in language acquisition. Why do these support the "nature" perspective?   3) Distinguish between attachment and temperament. What are the key differences between these two concepts? In what ways may they be considered to be similar? Give a specific example of an attachment pattern, and describe ways in which it may be viewed as similar or different from a specific temperament.   4) In a false-belief task, an experimenter shows kids a box of crayons and asks children what is inside. All children answer, "crayons." Next, they show the children that the box actually contains candy. Finally, the experimenter asks the children what a friend who has not seen the contents of the box would say was inside. Explain how three-year-olds vs. 5-year-olds would answer this question and why.
What type of intermolecular force of attraction is indicated by the arrow?
Budget Electronics is planning to sell 2,200 and produce 2,000 wicker baskets during June. Each unit requires 120 linear feet of wicker and 0.70 hours of direct labor. Wicker costs $0.35 per linear foot and employees of the company are paid $13.00 per hour. Manufacturing overhead is applied at a rate of 140% of direct labor costs. The company wants to have 10% of the wicker needed for the next month's production available at the end of each month. The expected production in July is 1,800 baskets. What is the total amount that will be budgeted for direct labor for June?
Read the original source and the paraphrase beneath it. If the student's paraphrase of the original source contains an error, choose the option that describes the error. If the paraphrase is acceptable, choose "The paraphrase is acceptable." ORIGINAL SOURCE Signs of extreme tension. Many subjects showed signs of nervousness in the experimental situation, and especially upon administering the more powerful shocks. In a large number of cases the degree of tension reached extremes that are rarely seen in sociopsychological laboratory studies. Subjects were observed to sweat, tremble, stutter, bite their lips, groan, and dig their fingernails into their flesh. These were characteristic rather than exceptional responses to the experiment.--Stanley Milgram, "Behavioral Study of Obedience," 1963, p. 376. PARAPHRASEIn his experiments on obedience to authority figures, Milgram (1963) noted that subjects exhibited "signs of extreme tension." Reactions such as perspiring and groaning were, at the time, unprecedented in sociopsychological studies, and they disturbed researchers overseeing the experiments (p. 376).

The diploid chromosome number of an organism is usually represented as 2n. Humans have a diploid chromosome number of 46. What would be the expected haploid chromosome number in a human?
Question 2: Full Model (2a) 2pts - Fit a logistic regression model (use logit link function) with target_5yrs as the response variable and all other variables as predicting variables. Include an intercept. Call it model1. Display the summary table for the model.  (2b) 2pts - Interpret the free_throw_percent coefficient in the context of this model. (2c) 2pts - What are the AIC and BIC for this model? Compare AIC and BIC in terms of the types of models they tend to select. (2d) 2pts - Conduct a multicollinearity test on model1. Using a VIF threshold of 10, what can you conclude? Is your conclusion consistent with your observations from question (1b)?  (2e) 2pts - Evaluate the overall regression for model1. Use an alpha level of 0.05. What do you conclude? Include your reasoning.
(Marquardt) A middle aged mixed breed dog is diagnosed with a small oral mass. Cytology confirms the mass is malignant, but cannot further differentiate it. The dog undergoes CT scan followed by surgical resection (partial mandibulectomy). However, after this, the owners do not have money for any additional therapy. Which of the following would have the best prognosis at this point, given the constraints on therapy?

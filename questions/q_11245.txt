A breeder is growing pea plants that are either tall (T) or dwarf (t) stature and tall is dominant over dwarf. The peas also have either red (R) flowers or white (r) flowers. He finds that when tall plants with red flowers are crossed with dwarf plants with white flowers that all the offspring are tall and have pink flowers (F1). He then allows the F1 plants to self pollinate and grows out the resultant F2 seeds. Use the Punnett squares below to answer the questions that follow. P1 = TTRR x ttrr        tr tr   TR TtRr TtRr   TR TtRr TtRr      F1 = all plants TtRr     F1 is self-pollinated so TtRr x TtRr = F2       TR Tr tR tr   TR TTRR TTRr TtRR TrRr   Tr TTRr TTrr TtRr Ttrr   tR TtRR TtRr ttRR ttRr   Tr TtRr Ttrr ttRr ttrr      What will be the phenotypic ratio of the plants grown in the F2 generation?

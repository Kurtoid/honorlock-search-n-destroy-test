Proteins are found embedded in the membrane or attached to one side of the membrane. Those proteins that are embedded in the cell membrane are called (1)                         proteins.  Most of these proteins go all the way across the plasma membrane and are called (2)                          proteins. These often function in transporting materials into and out of the cell. (3)                         proteins are loosely bound to one side of the membrane and are not embedded in the lipid bilayer.

You discover a novel microorganism and are excited to characterize it. Through several experiments, you discover that the microorganism possesses the following structures:  Lipopolysaccharide Peptidoglycan Type IV pilus Capsule  You conduct more experiments and discover the following characteristics:  Undergoes division in multiple planes Forms cell-to-cell contacts. After approximately 30 minutes, the cells whom it contacted are then able to form cell-to-cell contacts with other cells; you suspect DNA is transmitted during these contacts Possesses a non-chromosomal gene that inactivates silver heavy metals The organism was only isolated from water samples 3 ft below the surface of a fresh water lake (not any higher or any lower)  Based on the information above, answer the following questions (assume that if a structure is not listed then the bacteria does not possess it): 1. Is the organism Gram-positive or Gram-negative? [gram] 2. What would be its most likely morphology? [shape] 3. Is it motile or non-motile? [motile] 4. List one structure that could be considered a virulence factor. [factor] 5. Does it possess a plasmid? Yes or No. [plasmid] 6. If it does possess a plasmid, identify one category of plasmid could this fall under. (If no plasmid, type N/A) [category] 7. Identify one type of horizontal gene transfer this organism could undergo [HGT] 8. What cellular structure allows the organism to remain strictly 3 ft below the surface of the lake? [structure]

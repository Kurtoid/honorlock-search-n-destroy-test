A steam engine runs on the Rankine cycle. The steam leaves the boiler at 20 bar and 250 oC. The turbine has an efficiency of 75% and an outlet pressure of 0.5 bar. Pressure changes in the boiler and condenser can be considered negligible and the liquid leaving the condenser is saturated. If the turbine was reversible, what would be the quality of the stream coming out of it (i.e. fraction of it would be steam)?

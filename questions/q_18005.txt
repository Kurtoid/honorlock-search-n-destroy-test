Referring to Figure 4 below, write a formula that would be used in cell B10 to determine the Total Cost of making copies for a given number of copies made. Use a VLOOKUP function in the formula to look up the number of copies made in cell A10, looking in the table of information in cells A2:B7 to find the price per copy. The total cost will be the price per copy times the number of copies made. Write the formula so that it works when copied down to cells B11:B13. Syntax for the function:      =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup]) Figure 4

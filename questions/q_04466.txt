Assign only the Medical and Surgical section codes for this case: PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Pelvic pain.2. History of previous pelvic surgery and ovarian cyst.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Pelvic pain.2. History of previous pelvic surgery and ovarian cyst.OPERATION PERFORMED: Laparoscopic adhesiolysis.SURGEON: Susan Smith, MDANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mLURINE OUTPUT: 70 mLIV FLUIDS: 750 mLDESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to theoperating room. She was placed in the dorsal supine position and general anesthesia was induced andprepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A Foley catheter was placed to gravity and speculum wasplaced in the posterior and anterior vagina and the cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum. AHulka clamp was then inserted through the cervix into the uterus for uterine manipulations and thetenaculum was removed and attention was then turned to the abdomen.A supraumbilical incision was made with a scalpel and elevated up with towel clamps. A long Veressneedle was then placed and CO2 gas was used to insufflate the abdomen and pelvis. A 10-12 trocar andsleeve were then placed and confirmed via the laparoscope. The dense omental adhesions to the anteriorabdominal wall were noted immediately. At this time, we were not able to see into the pelvic region. Asecond 5 mm trocar and sleeve were placed in the left mid quadrant under direct visualization. Theligature device was then placed developing a plane between the omentum and the anterior abdominalwall. The adhesiolysis took place and it took approximately 25 minutes to release all of the omental adhesionsfrom the anterior abdominal wall. We were then able to visualize the pelvis and a blunt probe was placedthrough the port. The ovary was visualized and photos were taken with no evidence of any ovarian cyst orovarian pathology or of pelvic endometriosis. The uterus also appeared normal and the left tube and ovarywere surgically absent. The appendix was easily visualized and noted to be noninflamed, normal inappearance, and there were no adhesions in the right lower quadrant. The upper abdominal exam wasunremarkable. The procedure was terminated at this time. The ports were removed. CO2 gas was allowedto escape. The incisions were closed with 4-0 Vicryl suture. The Hulka clamp was removed. The vaginawas noted to be hemostatic. The patient was awakened from anesthesia, the Foley catheter was removed,and she was taken in stable condition to the recovery room.

The influenza virus attaches to host sialic acid molecules through the hemagglutinin envelope protein. This interaction is an essential step for Influenza virus to enter the host cells. The host sialic acid molecules are linked to the carbohydrate galactose on the surface of the host cell. The hemagglutinin of avian influenza virus strains binds preferentially to sialic acid in the a-2,3 linkage conformation. The hemagglutinin of human influenza virus strains binds preferentiallyto sialic acid in the a-2,6 linkage conformation. Which of the following would decrease the ID50 of the avian influenza virus for human cells?
Match the body part to the correct anatomical region.

Tina Simmons worked as a welder at a shipyard company where she was forced to encounter nude and partially nude pictures posted by her male co-workers in common areas. The men also referred to her using obscene nicknames and made offensive remarks concerning her body. When Tina complained, her supervisor took no corrective action despite having an active sexual harassment policy approved by the EEOC. Tina wished to file a discrimination suit but instead she chose to endure the harassment as she could not risk losing her job. Which of the following, if true, would have strengthened her resolve to file a discrimination suit?

(For graduate students enrolled in EGM5444) A rocket of mass M and moment of inertia I is constrained to move in a horizontal plane. Its thrust is directed such that its velocity is always directed toward a target which moves along the x-axis according to xtarget = a sin wt. A torque T about the center of mass controls the orientation of the craft. Ignore the physical dimensions of the rocket.  Find the constraint equation on the velocity. Find the constraint equation on the orientation of the rocket. Find the coefficients of the Lagrange multipliers. Find the generalized forces associated with the coordinates x, y, q and f for the force F and torque T. Find the equations of motion.

An industry has two firms producing at a constant unit cost of $10 per unit. The inverse demand curve for the industry is p = 110 - .5q. Suppose that firm 1 is a Stackelberg leader in choosing its quantity (i.e., firm 1 chooses its quantity first, knowing that firm 2 will observe firm 1's quantity when it chooses its own output.) How many units of output will firm 2, the follower, produce?

Question 2. [35 points] Haier and Geli are two Chinese manufactures of home appliances that have merged. They have their own markets in Europe. Haier has plants in France, Germany, and Finland, whereas Geli has plants in the United Kingdom and Italy. The European market is divided into four regions: North, East, West, and South. Plant capacities (millions of units per year), annual fixed costs (millions of Euros per year), regional demand (millions of units), and variable production and shipping costs (Euros per unit) are as shown in the table below. a. Prior to the merge, if Haier sets an objective of minimizing the total costs while satisfying all market demands (no shortage), how should its network be structured (providing all plants remain open)?   [5 points] Define all the decision variables and cost parameters that you need to construct the model.  [10 points] Set up the optimization model and write down the mathematical formulation, including the objective function and all constraints.  [5 points] Solve the model in Excel and briefly describe the optimal solution you found.  b. [15 points] After the merge, how should the new network be structured to satisfy all market demands (no shortage), if the merged company sets the objective of minimizing the total fixed and variable costs? In this scenario, considering that plants may open or closed and that markets may receive products from one or more plants. Solve the model in Excel and briefly describe the optimal solution you found.

4 pages, double spaced (1200 words) Workers' Compensation is typically the exclusive remedy for recovery when a worker is injured while in the course and scope of employment.  You represent an injured employee  who works  in the warehouse of a manufacturing company.  The worker  was injured when he was struck from behind by a tow-motor while walking in the aisle of the warehouse.  The tow motor was being operated  by an intoxicated co-worker who was not trained on how to safely operate it.   At one time the aisles in the warehouse were designated as one way for tow motor operators with each aisle having alternating directions.  In an effort to improve efficiency, the company recently switched to allow for tow motor traffic to drive  in both directions in all aisles.  Had the one way aisle policy been in effect, your client would have seen the tow motor coming towards him.  In addition you learn that in an effort to save money, the company reduced lighting in the warehouse by 50% and also  stopped its random drug and alcohol testing program which had been run by an outside vendor.      Under these facts, do you think that your client, the injured worker may be able to obtain a recovery  outside of the Workers Compensation system?  Why would a worker want to recover outside of  the Workers' Compensation system?   What arguments do you anticipate that the company may advance to keep the case within the Workers' Compensation system?

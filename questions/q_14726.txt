Read the passage and answer the questions following it.   Excerpt from article: "Eighteenth Century Public Humiliation Penalties in 21st Century America"   Introduction    Nathaniel Hawthorne's timeless classic, The Scarlet Letter,  highlighted the shaming punishments and public humiliation tactics commonly employed in colonial America. Few who have read this masterpiece could forget the tragic journey of the novel's central character, Hester Prynne, who exemplifies shaming punishments. Hester committed the unthinkable crime of bearing a child out of wedlock and subsequently received a punishment requiring her to display a large scarlet letter "A" on her bosom. Today, many Americans would probably scoff at punishments creating public spectacles, yet a trend is emerging in our courts indicating that the judiciary is beginning to view shaming penalties as acceptable punishments. Most recently, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals asserted the validity of so-called "Scarlet Letter" sentences in U.S. v. Gementera.    In Gementera, the Ninth Circuit upheld a district court probation requirement that a convicted mail thief must stand outside of a post office with a sandwich board sign containing the following message: "I stole mail. This is my punishment." While the Gementera court "is to be commended for seeking innovative ways of dealing with a serious social problem,"sanctioning penalties intended to subject persons to humiliation raise substantial concerns. Specifically, the Gementera court improperly exercised its authority by imposing a punishment contrary to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which were in place at the time of this holding. In circumventing Congress, Gementera set poor precedent, likely created several unintended consequences, and raised substantial constitutional concerns.   Background of Shaming Punishments in America   Thoughts of 17th and 18th century America invoke vivid images of mindless witch-hunts and public punishment involving stocks and pillories. Also popular during this period were laws requiring criminals to publicly confess their misdeeds or display signs and wear letters proclaiming their sins. Other punishments actually "involved branding the criminal on a visible part of the body, such as the cheek or forehead, so as to unmistakably alert the public to the offender's criminal tendencies."  Officials conducted these punishments in prominent places during busy times of the day for all to see.    Several theories attempt to explain the popularity of public humiliation in colonial times. For example, many historians agree that the governing theocracy contributed significantly to this phenomenon. The primary reason why this theocracy fostered an environment in which shaming thrived is that it "regarded social status as the highest good." One commentator also noted that the "citizenry . . . preoccupied itself with conforming to the common moral norms and rules." These various forms of stripping citizens of social standing quickly became effective and preferred methods of punishment in this hierarchical society.    The theocratic system of government is not the only factor responsible for the development of shaming penalties in colonial America. Communities were small and citizens depended on one another for survival. Persons living under such circumstances wanted to maintain a strong relationship with the community because significant  hardships accompanied individuals with tainted reputations. One commentator recognized that "shame penalties led to shunning by the community, a high price to pay in . . . close-knit communities."Shunned colonists endured "the judgmental, jeering eyes of community peers with whom they worked and encountered daily."  Lack of mobility also contributed to the rise of shaming. "Most residents were life-long . . . [and] in the mid-seventeenth century, migration in and out of Massachusetts' towns stood at less than one percent annually." This factor, along with the governing theocracy and the interdependence of the colonial citizenry, combine to explain the effectiveness of shaming during this period. These factors quickly dissipated in the latter-half of the 18th Century and the beginning of the 19th Century.

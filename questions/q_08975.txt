Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr A sample of gas collected at 21.0degC and 660 mm Hg, has a volume of 1.83 liters. What will the pressure of the gas be if the temperature is increased to 38.0degC and the volume is reduced to1.50 liters? To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem.  Be sure to include the answer. Show your work (equation/and units) by using the equation editor () in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use     to insert ratios. Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

Standard disclaimer: use the algorithms from class, such as DFS, Explore, BFS, Dijkstra's (using min-heaps), SCC, etc., as a blackbox subroutine for your algorithm. If you attempt to modify one of these algorithms you will not receive full credit, even if it is correct. Make sure to explain your algorithm in words (no pseudocode!), explain the correctness of your design, and state and analyze its running time. Faster - and correct - solutions worth more credit.   Consider some directed graph  . We say that   is pseudo-connected if for every pair of vertices

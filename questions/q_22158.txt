In November seven members of the Cleveland Police Narcotics squad arrested Chili "Big Dawg" Dawson in his restaurant, the Heartburn Cafe. The officers had a valid arrest warrant but did not have a warrant to search the restaurant. They did have probable cause for a search warrant and were in the process of obtaining a warrant. Because they received credible information that Chili might be armed, the officers entered the restaurant with weapons drawn. The few customers in the restaurant were escorted out and Chili, who was behind the counter, was seized, handcuffed, and informed of his Miranda rights. With the situation well in hand the police holstered their weapons. Officer Paprika then told Chili that he would like his consent to search the restaurant. At first Chili said nothing and Paprika said "Look, you do what you want. We have sufficient information to get a search warrant and will secure one by this afternoon or tomorrow." Chili then said "I want to talk to my lawyer." He went to a telephone and tried twice to reach his lawyer. After unsuccessfully trying to reach his lawyer, Chili said to Paprika "Look I know what you are here for" and led Paprika behind the counter and revealed a two-pound brick of marijuana. Paprika seized the marijuana and said "well that's nice but I still want to search the whole restaurant." Chili then agreed to let them search and the police found 20 kilos of cocaine in boxes in the back of the restaurant. While in custody at the police station two vice squad detectives, Mutt and Jeff, took Chili into an interrogation room. They administered Miranda warnings and told Chili they wanted to question him about the gambling operation they believed he ran from the restaurant. Chili agreed to talk to them and made incriminating statements. Chili also challenged the admissibility of the marijuana arguing that he was coerced into giving the police the marijuana. The trial court should:

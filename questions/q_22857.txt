For questions 14-16, consider the following scenario: A woman who is lactose-intolerant avoids milk/dairy but doesn't follow her doctor's recommendation to take calcium supplements.  Over time, her blood calcium levels drop.  Cells of the parathyroid gland detect the decrease in blood calcium levels.  The parathyroid gland secretes parathyroid hormone into the bloodstream.  Parathyroid hormone causes bone cells to break down bone tissue.  As this breakdown occurs, calcium which was stored in the bones is released into the bloodstream.  As a result, her blood calcium levels increase.

A 10.0 gram sample of a compound of nitrogen and oxygen is found to contain 3.04 g of nitrogen.  Calculate the empirical formula for the compound.  To receive full credit:  Use the factor unit method and the math equation editor in the toolbar (click the 3 vertical dots to expand the toolbar - the equation editor is the, key )  to insert the mathematical equation with the numbers and units that you used to calculate the moles of nitrogen. Insert a second equation to show how you calculated the moles of oxygen. Lastly show a third equation showing how you calculated the mole ratio. Finally, give the empirical formula for the compound. Do the calculation and provide your final answer.  Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper.  Take a picture of your work and insert the picture. Make sure to use the factor unit method to calculate the moles of nitrogen and oxygen and show how you calculated the mole ratio.  Lastly, make sure you give the empirical formula.

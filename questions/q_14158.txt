3. PAC Learning (20 points)    Consider the hypothesis class Hs2 "symmetric, depth two decision trees over n boolean variables". Each hypothesis in Hs2 is a decision tree of depth two (i.e., a tree with four leaves, all distance two from the root) where the left and right child of the root must be the same variable. The example to the right should help you visualize Hs2. Assume that there are only two classes. (a) As a function of n, how many syntactically distinct trees are there in Hs2? Two trees are syntactically distinct if they "look" different, even if they compute the same function. Explain your answer. (b) Give a bound for the number of examples needed in the PAC model to learn any target concept in Hs2 for some error e and confidence d. (c) As a function of n, how many semantically distinct trees are there in Hs2? Two trees are semantically distinct only if they compute different functions. Explain your answer. (d) Now give a tighter bound for the number of examples needed to learn any target concept in Hs2. Feel free to use latex-like style equations or describe the equation in words. For example, use delta for d and epsilon for e. Clearly mark your answers with (a), (b), (c) and (d).

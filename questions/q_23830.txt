Glutathione serves a protective function in animals by destroying toxic peroxides that are generated during aerobic metabolic processes. It also helps the body get rid of toxins, especially heavy metals such as mercury.   Blank #1: List the three amino acid residues in glutathione, from N-terminus to C-terminus, using 3-letter abbreviations. Note the unusual peptide bond formed between the side chain g-carbonyl of the N-terminus amino acid, rather than the a-carbonyl.  Blank #2: What is the overall charge of glutathione at pH 7.0? Table of pKa values is provided below. Blank #3: How many equivalents of strong base would be necessary to fully titrate a fully protonated solution of glutathione?

The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a process which generates random outcomes. The sample space is denoted S. All outcomes in S are equally likely.             Flip three coins. We can order the coins by using distinct fair coins The possible outcomes are: S = {(H,H,H), (H,H,T), (H,T,H), (T,H,H), (H,T,T), (T,H,T), (T,T,H), (T,T,T)}. These eight outcomes constitute the sample space. Consider the three events:   A = {Get a T on the first coin.}= {(T,H,H), (T,H,T), (T,T,H), (T,T,T)}   B = {Get a H on the third coin.}= {(H,H,H), (H,T,H), (T,H,H), (T,T,H)}    AOB = {Get a T on the first coin and a H on the third coin.}= {(T, H, H), (T, T, H)}   Using the previously calculated probabilities. In problems 6, 7 & 8, Are the events A and B independent?

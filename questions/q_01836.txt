Let's zoom in and express genes. One analogy of gene expression is the following: Imagine that we have a recipe book. That recipe book is our DNA. Now, we are taking notes of a recipe that fits in only one page (it has to be only one page). That process is transcription (pretty much the same language, with our modifications, but same language). Our notes become the RNA. And when we prepare the recipe and serve it to family and friends, we "transform" that language into something completely different. This transformation is translation - from written words to food. The food, then, would be the proteins... And that's, broadly, gene expression.

This is Question D. Please write your solution complete with your full name and the problem number. When you are finished with the auto-graded portion of the exam, upload your solution to the Question D assignment in the Exam 1 module within 15 minutes.  Recall that the set {0,1}* is the set of finite length bit strings. Consider the recursive function flip which takes bit strings for inputs and gives bit strings for outputs, defined by the following: Foundation rule: flip(l) = l. Constructor rule: For s [?] {0,1}*, flip(s0) = flip(s)1 and flip(s0) = flip(s)1.  (3 points, 1 point each.) Show the output when flip is applied to the following strings. What is:   flip(010)?  flip(1101)?  flip(0010)?   (7 points.) Use structural induction to show that flip(flip(s)) = s for any s [?] {0,1}*.

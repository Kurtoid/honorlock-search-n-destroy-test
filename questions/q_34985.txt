Water is the working fluid in an ideal regenerative Rankine cycle. Superheated vapor enters the turbine at 10 MPa, 480degC, and the condenser pressure is 6 kPa.   Steam expands through the first-stage turbine to 0.7 MPa where some of the steam is extracted and diverted to an open feedwater heater operating at 0.7 MPa.  The remaining steam expands through the second-stage turbine to the condenser pressure of 6 kPa.  Saturated liquid exits the feedwater heater at 0.7 MPa.  Determine for the cycle.   a. The heat addition, in kJ per kg of steam entering the first-stage turbine. b. The thermal efficiency. c. The heat transfer from the working fluid passing through the condenser to the cooling water, in kJ per kg of steam entering the first-stage turbine.

An event schema, also known as a cognitive script, is a set of behaviors that can feel like a routine. For example, think about what you do when you ride an elevator. First, the doors open and you wait to let exiting passengers leave the elevator car. Next, you step into the elevator and turn around to face the doors. Last, you look for the correct button to push to reach your destination. Riding an elevator has its own event schema.

This is a closed-book test. Make sure your cell phone is put away--do not even look at it during the exam. You may use scratch paper during this exam. Show the front and back of each blank page to your webcam now if you did not do so during the room scan. If you did not do a thorough room scan earlier, including the desktop area where you have your computer, do so right now. Failure to properly complete the room scan may cause you to have to repeat the exam later. And don't forget to do the Exam 3 Bonus assignment after completing this exam (extra credit). Good luck!

The ________ plane divides the body into superior and inferior parts.
The monosaccharide D-ribose can exist in an open-chain and a ring form (referred to as D-ribopyranose, shown below). When the open chain form of D-ribose is converted to the ring form, a new chiral center (referred to as the anomeric carbon) is formed. This produces two stereoisomers: the a-anomer and the b-anomer of D-ribopyranose (shown below).  In the LEAST stable chair form of D-ribopyranose, would the bolded OH group (also indicated with a solid arrow) be axial or equatorial? You can disregard the anomeric OH group to answer this question. [axeq] Which of the two anomers of D-ribopyranose is MORE stable? Note that the more stable anomer can assume the more stable chair conformation. [stableanomer] Which of the following options best describes the isomeric relationship between the two anomers of D-ribopyranose? [relationship]

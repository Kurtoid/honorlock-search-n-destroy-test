A light triangular plate OAB is in a horizontal plane. Three forces with magnitudes, F1 = 5.0N, F2 = 8.0N  and  F3 = 10.0 N act on the plate, which is pivoted about a vertical axes through point O. In the figure, F2 is perpendicular to OB. Consider the counterclockwise sense as positive.  a) What is the sum of the torques about the vertical axis through point O, acting on the plate due to forces F1, F2, and F3 ? b) If the moment of inertia of the triangular plate is 0.655 kg.m2, what is the magnitude of the tangential acceleration of the plate at point B.

In the following section, you will answer two short essay questions. Each question should be answered in 5-8 sentences. I will only grade up to the first 8 sentences of your writing, so do not try to throw a bunch of stuff at the wall and see if it sticks. Each answer must display a clear understanding of the topics at hand, must connect to course materials, and should be explicitly sociological (i.e., use appropriate terms and theories). I strongly suggest you make a quick bullet point outline for each response before diving in. Answers shorter than five sentences will receive an automatic 5 point penalty.

Athletes performing in bright sunlight often smear black eye grease under their eyes to reduce glare. Does eye grease work? In one study, 8 student subjects took a test of sensitivity to contrast after a fixed time facing into bright sun, both with and without eye grease. Measurements for the increase in sensitivity to contrast were obtained for the 8 subjects.  A positive value indicates they were more sensitive to contrast when using black eye grease (the desired outcome) and a negative value indicates they were less sensitive.  A value of zero indicates there was no difference in sensitivity to contrast when using the black eye grease.   Below you are given a boxplot of the data.

The drawing shows projectile motion at three points along the trajectory. The speeds at the points are v1, v2, and v3. Assume there is no air resistance and rank the speeds, largest to smallest. (Note that the symbol > means "greater than.")
In the figure, a small particle of charge -1.9 x 10-6 C and mass m = 3.1 x 10-12 kg has speed v0 = 8.1 x 103 m/s as it enters a region of uniform magnetic field. The particle is initially traveling upward, perpendicular to the magnetic field and is observed to travel in the semicircular path that bends to the right as shown with radius R = 5.0 cm.  Answer the following two questions based on this scenario.

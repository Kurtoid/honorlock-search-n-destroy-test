9) A contractor plans on supporting a high rise building in West Palm Beach Florida on 18" diameter auger cast piles installed in the Anastasia Limestone Formation. Six individual borings where performed on the site.  The mean cohesion, c [ cohesion = unit skin friction =  1/2  sqrt (qu) sqrt (t)] in each boring was 12 tsf, 9 tsf, 8 tsf, 6 tsf, 8tsf and 6 tsf (note recoveries are 0.8).   The mean cohesion, c (fs,B) , for all the rock specimens at the site is 8.2 tsf, with a standard deviation of 4.5 tsf.  The estimated unit skin friction from the mean boring data and load testing on the site is given as, fs,bias corrected (tsf)  = 0.2+0.95 fs,B with method error

T(n) for 6 algorithms B1-B6 are given below. Rank order these algorithms. B1: T(n)=lg2n +10 B2: T(n)=25(logn to the base 8)3+100 B3: T(n)=5n-3n B4: T(n)=40n5+300n2+20n+1 B5: T(n)=n!-4n3+5 B6: T(n)=2nn-1000n Use the labels of algorithms (i.e., B1, B2) for filling the blank lines. The first blank line is for the most efficient algorithm, and the last blank in the second row is for the least efficient one. Your rank ordering from most efficient to least efficient: [b1] < [b2] < [b4] < [b3] < [b5] < [b6]

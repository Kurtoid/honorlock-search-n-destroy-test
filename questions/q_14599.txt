During a titration,15.25 mL of NaOH was used to titrate 0.255 grams of KHP. The molar mass of KHP is 204.22 g/mol. There is one mole of NaOH (OH-) to one mole of KHP (H+).    1) How many moles of NaOH were used? (keep 3 s.f. and do not use scientific notation nor write a unit) 2) What is the molarity of this NaOH solution? (keep 3 s.f. and do not use scientific notation nor write a unit)

For following questions, please work on papers and upload answers with all your work. An information sheet is attached in the end. You can only upload 1 file directly to this question. If you have more than one file, please send the files to me through email before submitting the test. (To make sure your email was sent, please check your "sent mail" files. This will be your evidence of sending time.) Please send all the answers (for both question 23 and 24) to xyue@valenciacollege.edu with the title: Final Part 2   12. A sample of Calcium carbonate is reacted with hydrochloric acid to start following reaction: CaCO3(s)  + 2 HCl (aq) --> 2CaCl2(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g) 1) How many moles of CO2 will generate from 10.00 g CaCO3? (3 pts)   2) If CO2 is collected over water at 35.0 degC and 760 mmHg, and total 2.40 L gas is collected, how many moles of CO2 are collected consider CO2 as an ideal gas? (3 points) The vapor pressure of water is 41 mm Hg at 35.0 degC   3) Based on the result from question a and b, calculate percent yield of CO2. (2 points)   13.  1)A sample of 80.0 g oxygen gas was kept in a sealed gas tank. The tank was kept at 25 @C and the pressure was shown to be 10.0 atm. If consider the oxygen as ideal gas, what was the volume of the tank? (4 points) 2)The tank was move outside and the temperature went up to 55 @C. If the volume of the tank cannot change, what would the pressure turn into? (4 points)   14. Use the chemical equation below to answer the following questions. Na2CO3 (aq) + AlCl3 (aq) --> Al2(CO3)3 (s) + NaCl (aq) Na2CO3: 105.99 g/mol; AlCl3: 133.34 g/mol; Al2(CO3)3: 233.99 g/mol; NaCl: 58.44 g/mol. 1) Balance the equation.

Veins have valves to keep blood flowing in the correct direction while arteries use _________ to maintain the direction of blood flow?
Consider the execution of an arbitrary flow-insensitive, context-insensitive, field-sensitive pointer analysis (as was presented in the pointer analysis lesson) on the following programs. For each program, select whether the pointer analysis can prove the assertion using a type-based or an allocation-site based heap abstraction. Assume the following class definition for type Node: class Node { int data; Node next; } Program: Node v1 = new Node();Node v2 = new Node();Node tmp = v1;v1 = v2;v2 = tmp;assert(v1 != v2);  Can prove assertion with type-based heap abstraction? [p2type] Can prove assertion with allocation-site based heap abstraction? [p2alloc]

A distribution of point charges is placed on the coordinate system shown below. The axis is marked in meters. Assume the potential infinitely far from the origin is zero.   a) Calculate the electric potential due to the distribution of charges at point P, which is located at the origin. b) Find the electric potential at r= 8mi+4mj (8m, 4m) labeled as P' in the figure. c) A charge qc = 1.965x10-3 C is placed at the origin and is moved infinitely far away. What is the change in potential energy for qc. d) First of all, qc is removed from the origin. Then a charge of qd=8.65x10-7 C is placed at P'. What is the change in potential energy in moving this charge to the origin? part a) V1 =-3.182 x107 V V2 =1.659x107 V V3 =5.529 x106 V VP =-9.699x106 V part b) V1' =-3 x107 V V2' =3.996x107 V V3' =2.492 x106 V VP' =1.245 x107V part c) 12. The charge qc = 1.965x10-3 C is originally placed at the origin and then moved infinitely far from the origin. What is the changed in electric potential energy for this situation? Put your answer in scientific notation, and write the coefficient rounding to 3 decimal places (no units).

Mary and her friend are starving during a road trip to visit her sister. They pull over and discover a "Hole in the wall" restaurant. It doesn't look very fancy, but they are starving and will eat anything at this point. Surprisingly, it is the best food either of them have had in a long time and when their waiter hears they are traveling, gives them a list of restaurants he suggests on their way. This is an example of ____________________.

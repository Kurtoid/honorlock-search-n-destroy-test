Problem No. 3   A rigid bar ACDB is pinned at end A and supported by vertical wires of the same material (E=210GPa) and  equal cross section area (A=80 mm2) at point C and point D as shown below  .  The  coefficient of thermal expansion of steel is       alpha = 12x10-6/oC. The dimensions are         c = 0.8m,  d =2.4m and L = 3.0m. The vertical force P = 10 kN.

This information is used for the first 3 questions: A researcher was interested in studying the effects of neonicotinoids , a pesticide used on farms to control pests. Specifically, he had observed that many bee populations, which were not directly sprayed with the pesticide were dying in greater numbers in areas where the pesticide was used. In his research journal he wrote down two competing ideas about his observations:   Increasing amounts of neonicotinoids use on local farms will lead to increased incidence of bee deaths  The is no relationship between neonicotinoids use and incidence of bee deaths  The researcher then went to a local agricultural area and collected 500 living and 500 dead bees to test for levels of neonicotinoids in their tissues. After testing 1,000 bees, he concluded that there was a statistical correlation between higher levels of neonicotinoids in the tissue of bees and the death rate of bees (dead bees had higher levels of the pesticide in their tissues). Which of the following statements accurately describes the dependent and independent variables in this experiment?

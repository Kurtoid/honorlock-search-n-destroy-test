For your final examination, you should write a cohesive, well-developed essay that fully addresses the essay prompt. Please closely read the following CQ Researcher articles (published January 24, 2014 (volume 24, issue 4)) and then the prompt below.     "Minimum Wage-Would Raising the Minimum Wage Help the Economy: Pro"by Jared Bernstein, Senior Fellow for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities   "Minimum Wage-Would Raising the Minimum Wage Help the Economy: Con"by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, President of the American Action Forum     par. 1Based on one well-established theory and two equally well-established facts, raising the minimum wage would help. par. 2The first fact is that the American economy is made up of 70 percent consumer spending. Economists widely agree that an extra dollar earned by a wealthy person is less likely to be spent than an extra dollar earned by a low-income person. The reasoning--as per the theory of different spending and saving patterns by income level: The rich person is not "income constrained." If there's something they want to buy, they needn't wait for that extra dollar. On the other hand, the low-income worker is much more likely to consume their extra dollar of earnings. par. 3The second fact is that moderate increases in the minimum wage boost the earnings of most low-wage workers without leading to large employment losses. The increase favored by the president and congressional Democrats, which would take the federal minimum wage from $7.25 up to $10.10 in three annual increments, would place the real value of the wage floor back where it was in the late 1960s and would directly affect about 13 percent of the workforce. In terms of the share of affected workers, that's slightly higher than many past increases, but given our older, more productive low-wage workforce, it's fair to label this proposed increase as "moderate." So, the empirical history of the minimum-wage program would suggest that the vast majority of low-wage workers would benefit from the increase. par. 4Summing up the facts: In an economy driven in no small measure by consumer spending, moderately boosting the pay of low-wage workers with relatively high propensities to spend their new earnings should produce slightly faster economic growth. par. 5Now, in a $16.5 trillion economy, a minimum wage increase that directly raises the pay of a relatively small share of the workforce by a small amount is unlikely to be a big deal in terms of the larger growth picture. I would not argue that raising the minimum wage is first and foremost a growth strategy, though it will help a bit at the margin. Where it really makes a difference is in helping working families toiling at the low end of the service economy get a bit closer to making ends meet.   par. 1Raising the federal minimum wage will neither reduce poverty nor boost growth. Increasing the minimum wage to $10, or even $15, would ensure that millions of Americans got raises--raises that they would presumably turn right around and spend. Isn't the former going to reduce poverty and the latter boost the economy? par. 2That would happen if the money came out of thin air. Unfortunately, it has to come out of the wallet of another American. In the worst case, forcing up the minimum wage at, say, a fast-food restaurant would mean not hiring another poor American. If so, the minimum wage hike for one low-wage worker comes directly out of the pocket of another. Which part of that is anti-poverty and which part is stimulus? par. 3Of course, not every dollar will come from not hiring low-wage workers. But every dollar will have to come from somewhere. A minimum wage hike means higher prices, lower raises for other workers or fewer dividends for seniors, IRA holders and pension funds. Low-wage workers may pay those higher prices, blue-collar workers are desperately clinging to their pensions, and seniors need their dividends to make ends meet. There is simply no guarantee that the resources are transferred from the well-to-do to the deserving. And the diminished resources of those harmed by hiking the minimum wage offset the spending of the beneficiaries. par. 4The minimum wage is a poor tool to fight poverty because it does not target those in poverty. Only 2 percent of workers earn the minimum wage, and only 20 percent of those are in poverty. The reality is that the dividing line between being poor and being non-poor is having a job. Only 7 percent of those who have a job are in poverty, while more than 27.5 percent of those without jobs are poor. par. 5Even worse, the minimum wage does not help anyone get a job. There is little evidence that past minimum-wage increases have led to layoffs, but recent research indicates that hiking the minimum wage would harm new hiring. That's not stimulus. par. 6The idea of increasing the minimum wage has a seductive appeal. No one opposes the idea that working Americans should make a few more dollars. Unfortunately, the idea does not stand up to close scrutiny.     _____________________________________________________________________________________ Topic: Using the above-noted articles, "Minimum Wage-Would Raising the Minimum Wage Help the Economy: Pro" and "Minimum Wage-Would Raising the Minimum Wage Help the Economy: Con," as reference sources, write an essay in which you analyze each author's use of one rhetorical tool or rhetorical appeal to achieve his or her specific purpose.  To start, determine what you believe is each author's specific purpose. Choose one of the following specific purposes for each author: to accuse, to calm, to condemn, to celebrate, to correct, to counter, to defend, to dismiss, to incite, to justify, to overturn, to praise, to provoke, to rally, to silence, or to solve.   Then, determine which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Pro" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose and then which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Con" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose. You must choose both rhetorical tools and/or appeals from the following list:       allusions authorities/outside sources definitions description dialogue examples facts figurative language narration personal testimony/anecdotes scenarios statistics counterarguments concessions qualifiers organization voice appeal to logic appeal to emotion appeal to character appeal to need appeal to value       Organize your ideas into a four-paragraph essay that includes the following paragraphs: (paragraph 1) an introduction paragraph; (paragraphs 2 and 3) two separate, well-developed rhetorical tools and/or rhetorical appeals body paragraphs (one focused on the "Pro" author's use of your chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose and the other focused on the "Con" author's use of your other chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose); and (paragraph 4) a conclusion paragraph. Your essay must include a forecasting thesis statement and effective topic and concluding sentences in each body paragraph. At least four times in your essay, you also must correctly integrate quotations, paraphrases, and/or summaries from the above-noted articles; remember to include proper in-text citations.

The Freundlich isotherm for adsorption of xylene for activated carbon is as follows: q = 51.3 Cf 0.204 where,              q = mg of xylene adsorbed/g of carbon Cf = aqueous equilibrium concentration of xylene It is desired to reduce xylene concentration from 1200 mg/L to 10 mg/L. You are asked to design a batch system to treat a flow 1000 L/day of solution containing 1200 mg/L of xylene.  Amount of xylene (Kg/d) to be removed from the water is most nearly: ( 1 m3 = 1000 L)

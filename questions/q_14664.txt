Granny Sweet makes hot sauce. The hot sauce is sold in 4 ounce bottles. Due to legal considerations, the average (m) fill on each bottle must be approximately 4 ounces.  96 bottles are opened and measured with the result that the average fill is 3.94 ounces. From past experience the standard deviation (s) of the fill is .42 ounces. Given this information is the average fill of hot sauce bottles significantly less than 4 ounces at the a = .05 level? The null hypothesis to test this contention is m = 4.0, and the alternative hypothesis to test this contention is m < 4.0. Is the average fill significantly less than 4 ounces at the a=.05 level?

Given this ticket lock: typedef struct __lock_t {    int ticket, turn;} lock_t;void lock_init(lock_t *lock) {    lock->ticket=0;    lock->turn=0;}void lock(lock_t *lock) {    int myturn = FetchAndAdd(&lock->ticket);    while (lock->turn != myturn)        ;}void unlock(lock_t *lock) {    lock->turn = lock->turn+1} Assuming a maximum of 3 threads in the system, and further assuming that the ticket lock is used "properly" (i.e., threads acquire and release it as expected), which of the following values of lock->ticket and lock->turn are possible at the same time? Explain. ticket=1, turn=0 ticket=12, turn=5 ticket=1001, turn=1000

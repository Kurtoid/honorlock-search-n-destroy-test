Do you use a smart watch or fitness tracker to monitor your health?  A recent survey found that in a random sample of 4272 adults, 898 of them say that they use a smart watch or fitness tracker.  The assumptions are met.  Minitab output for a 95% confidence interval is given below.   For each of the following interpretations, decide if they are correct or incorrect.   a. There is a 0.95 probability that the true proportion of adults that use a smart watch or fitness tracker is between 0.198 and 0.222. [incorrect]   b. We are 95% confident that the true proportion of adults that use a smart watch or fitness tracker is between 0.198 and 0.222. [correct]

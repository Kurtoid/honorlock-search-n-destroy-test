Please answer the following question and write your MIPS code: Suppose the MIPS32 hardware supports only the instructions add, sub, and, or, slt, lw, sw, beq, and j. Pseudo-instructions give MIPS a richer set of assembly language instructions than those implemented by the hardware through general-purpose registers (GPR). Explain how the following pseudo-instruction can be implemented using only the supported instructions shown above.   If you need to use any "extra" registers, you may use the t-registers, $t0, $t1, and so forth.        minfrom $rd, ($rs), ($rt)                 # rd = Mem[GPR[rs]] < Mem[GPR[rt]] ? Mem[GPR[rs]] : Mem[GPR[rt]]       # Note: it moves the minimal value from Mem[GPR[rs]] and Mem[GPR[rt]] to rd

A bacterial population divides (i.e., doubles) every 15 minutes. After 5 hours (300  minutes), how many bacteria will there be, if we start out with 10 bacteria in the population? A. If you wanted to solve the above problem, what numbers would you enter for each of the  variables in the population growth equation? Nt = N0e (rt) No = [v1] r = ln(2)/? [v2] t = [v3]   B. For 2pts. extra credit, use the scientific calculator in honolock to find the number of bacteria in the population after 480 minutes (i.e., solve the problem). [v4]

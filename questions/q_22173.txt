Two studies are described below. Determine if each study is an experiment or an observational study. Study 1: A doctor believes that patients who take vitamin C have less chance of getting sick. The doctor interviews a random sample of 60 of his patients and finds that 24 of them take vitamin C and 36 do not take vitamin C. The patients who take vitamin C, on average, were sick significantly less often than the patients that did not take vitamin C. Study 2: It is believed that pet ownership can reduce depression. To test this, a psychologist randomly selected 20 retirement homes where none of the residents owned a pet and interviewed a random sample of 35 residents from each community. It was determined that, on average, 21 of the 35 residents showed signs of depression. The psychologist then randomly selected ten of those communities and gave each community 12 cats and dogs for the residents to care for. Six months later, the psychologist interviewed the same 35 residents from each community again and found, on average the communities that were given the cats and dogs had significantly less signs of depression than the communities that did not receive the cats and dogs.

If I adopted this system would you:

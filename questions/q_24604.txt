Problem 1) 4:1 Multiplexer Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner.  The tool bar has indent functions. Write a System Verilog module named caseMUX41 with a procedural code, using a case statement to implement a 4:1 MUX. Parameterize the width of input arrays A, B, C, D using parameter n, the width of each input variable the table below. The case statement should select on variable S. Use a initialization and default for F of 0 (also appropriately sized with parameter n). Be sure to include initial value and a default. (Remember initialization is not done with the Verilog keyword initial, initial is only used in test benches.)   Your module should have n bit inputs A, B, C, D,  two bit select S, and n bit output F. For maximum credit your code should carefully follow the specification. Use the minimum number of lines to accomplish this specification. Use System Verilog, always_ff, and always_comb, and don't use reg datatype. Also use proper indentation for organization.  You will need this 4:1 multiplexer for a problem later.

A kid squirts water from a water cannon at a wall located 7.0 m away.  The initial velocity of the water is 15.0 m/s at an angle of 40deg above the horizontal.  If the  muzzle of the water cannon is 1.0 m above the ground, how high above the ground does the water hit the wall?  Assume the ground is level.  Ignore air resistance.  Show all your work.  (Hint: find time to hit the wall first.)

A heptapeptide was completely hydrolyzed to yield the following set of seven amino acids (in no particular order): Lys, Lys, Gly, Met, Phe, Ser, Glu (KKGMFSE).  Unfortunately, your lab is poor and you cannot afford an amino acid sequencer. However, you are capable of doing "old-school" chemistry and you obtain the following information: 1) Treatment with Sanger's reagent (DNFB) yields DNP-Ser 2) Treatment of the original heptapeptide with chymotrypsin yields a dipeptide and a pentapeptide. Treatment of the pentapeptide with Sanger's reagent yields DNP-Ser 3) Treatment of the original heptapeptide with CNBr had no effect 4) Treatment of the original heptapeptide with trypsin yielded two tripeptides and free Met. Treatment of one of the tripeptides with Sanger's reagent yields DNP-Ser; treatment of the other tripeptide with Sanger's reagent yields DNP-Gly.  What is the sequence of the original heptapeptide?

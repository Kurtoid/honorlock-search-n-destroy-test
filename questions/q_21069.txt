Identify Actors and Use Cases for the following specification of a software system: A patient information system to support mental health care is a medical information system that maintains information about patients suffering from mental health problems and the treatments that they have received. Most mental health patients do not require dedicated hospital treatment but need to attend specialist clinics regularly where they can meet a doctor who has detailed knowledge of their problems. These clinics are not just run in hospitals, they may also be held in local medical practices or community centers. The information system makes use of a centralized database of patient information that may be accessed and used from sites. The system is not a complete medical records system and so does not maintain information about other medical conditions. However, it may interact and exchange data with other clinical information systems.This system has two main purposes: to generate management information that allows health service managers to assess performance against local and government targets; and to provide medical staff with timely information to support the treatment of patients. Users of the system include clinical staff such as doctors, nurses, and health visitors (nurses who visit people at home to check on their treatment). Nonmedical users include receptionists who make appointments, medical records staff who maintain the records system, and administrative staff who generate reports. The system is used to record information about patients (name, address, age, next of kin, etc.), consultations (date, doctor seen, subjective impressions of the patient, etc.), conditions, and treatments. Reports are generated at regular intervals for medical staff and health authority managers. Typically, reports for medical staff focus on information about individual patients, whereas management reports are anonymized and are concerned with conditions, costs of treatment, etc. Identify at least 4 different actors and 5 different use cases. For the use cases also indicate who are the participating actors. Make sure to use appropriate naming for actors and use cases.  Sample Response to this question (use this an example to construct your response): Actors:a1a2 Use Cases:use case 1 (Participating Actors: a1, a2) use case 2 (Participating Actors: a2)

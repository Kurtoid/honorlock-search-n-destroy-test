Overview and Basis: In 1971 President Nixon (under advisement by Federal Reserve chairman Arthur Burns and Treasury Secretary John Connally) elected to fully decouple the US Dollar (USD) from the valuation of precious metals (a paradigm known as the "Gold Standard") and shift it to an unbacked, faith based "Fiat" model (Latin for "Let it be", or by declaration). Proponents of this transition proport that a more direct control of money supply (monetary policy) would allow the macro economy to be better stabilized in times of unrest, while critics have suggested that leaving the supply uncapped may lead to irresponsible management which would lead to decreasing purchasing power (inflation). Since this paradigm shift, USD has seen an average annual inflation of approximately 4%. Since long-term purchasing power of a currency is somewhat well represented as an inverse of overall monetary supply change, you will be comparing the change in M2 monetary supply to the changes in prices of Gold, Silver, as well as NASDAQ index value to explore any potential link as well as assess your ability to reliably model the data.

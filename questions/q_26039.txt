HISTORY: This patient is a 35-year-old male with a recurrent, reducible right inguinal hernia, noted on examination. He had undergone surgical repair of a right inguinal hernia 2 years ago, so he was familiar with the symptoms and called this surgeon's office for an appointment. The young man works in a health club as a personal trainer of body builders and, therefore, does heavy lifting on a daily basis. Otherwise, he is healthy, well-nourished, and well-built with no other surgical history and no other evident medical problems. Preoperative testing, including a chest x-ray, EKG, and usual laboratory work, were all within normal limits. He is admitted to the hospital for this procedure because it is a recurrent hernia, and the procedure will require that he have highly limited mobility for the next 36-48 hours. He will also stay in the hospital for a hart recovery period. He will then be placed on work-related disability and advised to avoid working for a minimum of 4 weeks.  OPERATIVE FINDINGS: A recurrent, reducible right inguinal hernia, direct and indirect was found. There was no strangulation or gangrene. A right inguinal hernia repair (Bassini with high ligation was performed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a supine position on the table. After satisfactory general anesthesia was administered the right groin was prepped with Betadine scrub and paint and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The skin overlying the groin was incised through the external inguinal ring, exposing the spermatic cord. The cord was then mobilized and a Penrose drain passed around it at the level of the pubic tubercle. The cord was skeletonized proximally, revealing a very small indirect inguinal hernia sac. The sac was dissected away from the remainder of the cord structure, which was left free of injury. The sac was opened and found to contain no contents. There was also a direct inguinal hernia noted but no femoral hernia noted. The sac was twisted and ligated with 3-0 silk suture ligature. The remainder of the sac was amputated. A floor repair was performed as described by Bassini with interrupted 0 Etbibond sutures between the transversalis fascia and the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. The internal inguinal ring was left to the size of the tip of an adult finger, and the initial suture medially was from the transversalis fascia into the aponeurosis over the pubic tubercle. Upon completion, hemostasis was adequate, and no relaxing incision was necessary. Spermatic cord was returned to the inguinal canal. The ilioinguinal nerve was blocked prior to this procedure and reblocked again with 0.5 percent Marcaine and epinephrine solution. The pubic tubercle, inguinal ligament, and subcutaneous tissue were also anesthetized with 0.5 percent Marcaine and epinephrine solution. The external oblique was then closed with. running 3-0 Vicryl. The wound was copiously irrigated and the skin closed with skin clip _ A sterile dressing was applied. Gentle traction was placed on the right testicle to fully return it to the scrotum. The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

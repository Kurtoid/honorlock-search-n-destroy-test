During our last class discussion class, we talked about some epidemiological events that happened in Philadelphia.  The most recent one occurred in July 1976 when the American Legion held a 4-day conference in Philadelphia, and by August they were 150 cases of the disease and 20 deaths. The Pennsylvania Department of Health and the CDC quickly determined that the most likely site of the exposure was of the four hotels used during the conference, Bellevue-Stratford, based on the higher rates of illness for those who stayed at that particular hotel. Three-part question.   (Please number your responses) 1. Imagine you are a CDC epidemiologist applying what you learned in public health; interestingly, cases occurred in individuals who had only been near the hotel, not in the hotel. This suggests that the causative agent of exposure was? 2. Secondly, after we discussed that large cooling towers, called chillers, where the specific cause of the bacteria that cause pneumonia. Federal air-conditioning standards changed after this Philadelphia epidemic. So the question is, why was this particular disease, which probably been around for quite some time unrecognized until 1976? 3. It wasn't until the following January that the biomedical sciences figured out the bacteria causing the epidemic, which by then the disease was called _________________ .

Section 1. The Four Quadrant Model (4QM).   In the problem, you are asked to explain the relationships depicted in the Four Quadrant Model (4QM) and predict changes in rents, prices, stock of space, and construction due to the shock using the model. It would be helpful for you to draw the 4QM before and after the shock to answer the questions. But you do not need to submit the drawings.   1. [8 points] Explain the relationship between the variables in each of the four quadrants: (i) What doesthe relationship in the quadrant stand for? (ii) How do variables depend on each other according to this relationship?  Quadrant I Quadrant II Quadrant III Quadrant IV    2. [4 points] Consider a more strict zoning regulations. Will this more strict zoning regulations affect any of the relationships depicted in the quadrants? If yes, explain how.   3. [12 points] How does the equilibrium change due to this more strict zoning regulations? To answer the questions below, it is helpful to draw the old and new equilibrium before and after the change in zoning regulations. You do not need to submit the drawing with the midterm, only use it to answer the questions below. (a) Compare the rents, prices, stock of space, and construction in the new equilibrium relative to the old equilibrium. (b) Briefly explain the intuition behind any of the changes of the equilibrium rents [2 points], prices [2 points], levels of construction [2 points], and steady-state stock of space [2 points]. If there are no changes, explain it intuitively as well.

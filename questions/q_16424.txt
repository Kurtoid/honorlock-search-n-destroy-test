VRAAG 3         3.   Die onderstaande diagram toon 'n geidealiseerde weergawe van golwe wat van links na regs in 'n rivier beweeg. Jy meet die tyd tussen twee opeenvolgende kruine wat by jou verbygaan, as 1,2 sekondes.             Regterklik op die onderstaande blou blokkie om die diagram in 'n nuwe venster oop te maak.                       3.1   Identifiseer enige ander punt wat in fase is met punt F.   (1)     3.2   Bereken die tyd wat ses kruine geneem het om verby 'n sekere punt te beweeg.   (3)     3.3   Wat is die amplitude van die golf?   (2)     3.4   Gee twee letters wat een golflengte van mekaar is.   (2)     3.5   Wat is die lengte van een golflengte? (y)   (3)     3.6   Teken 'n diagram met byskrifte van hoe twee golflengtes van hierdie golf sal lyk as die golflengte dieselfde bly, maar die amplitude verdubbel. Maak seker dat jy die golflengte en die amplitude met waardes benoem.   (3)             [14]

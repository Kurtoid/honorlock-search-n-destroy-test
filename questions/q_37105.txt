In this image, what affect did ATP have on the ATP-sensitive K+ channel?   ATP closed the channel  In step C, we can see that a depolarization activates/opens the voltage-dependent Ca++ channel.  In order for a depolarization to occur, K+ channels in the previous step (step B) would need to close.  This would prevent K+ from leaking out of the cell, which would result in an accumulation of positively charged ions inside the cell--depolarizing it.  If K+ channels were opened, this would lead to more K+ leaving the cell, which would hyperpolarize the cell...similar to what is seen in the after-hyperpolarization phase of an action potential.

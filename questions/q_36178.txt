A 75-year old man was found unconscious in his bathroom after falling and hitting his head.  He survived for several hours but died later in the hospital.  An autopsy was performed to determine cause of death.  The man had suffered 2 strokes.  He had also hit his head showing some damage to the brain.  Which neuroglia would have migrated to the damaged sites in his brain?

Thermograms are shown below for copolymers of poly(phenylquinoline-block-polystyrene) and their homopolymers.  The TGA was run at 10oC/min in N2.     - Which homopolymer has a greater thermal stability, the polyphenylquinoline or the polystyrene? Fill in blank with PPQ or PS:   [1] - What is the onset degradation temperature of the polyphenylquinoline (PPQ). Fill in blank with choice of A thru E: [2]         (A) 450degC         (B) 500degC         (C) 625degC         (D) 700degC         (E) 750degC - What is the composition (wt%) of PPQ in the 3a composite? Fill in blank with choice of A thru E: [3]         (A) 5%         (B) 17%         (C) 24%         (D) 65%         (E) 76% - What is the composition (wt%) of polystyrene block in the 3a composite? Fill in blank with choice of A thru E: [4]          (A) 5%         (B) 17%         (C) 25%         (D) 65%         (E) 76% - If the sample were run at 50degC/min instead of 10degC/min, how would that affect the curve relative to the one shown? Would it shift to the left or right? [5]   - How would the PPQ curve change if the same sample was run in an oxygen atmosphere rather than nitrogen? Fill in blank with choice of A thru E: [6]      (A) It would likely degrade at a higher onset temperature, but have the same amount or less of char yield.      (B) It would likely degrade at a higher onset temperature, and have a greater amount of char yield.      (C) It would likely degrade at a lower onset temperature, but have the same amount or less of char yield.      (D) It would likely degrade at a same onset temperature, but have a lower amount of char yield.      (E) It would likely degrade at a lower onset temperature, and have a higher amount of char yield.

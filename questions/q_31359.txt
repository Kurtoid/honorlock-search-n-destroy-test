Euparkeria is a rare disease. The symptoms are not clear at first, but grow worse as time progresses. There is a test which detects Euparkeria early, and allows treatment to start before the symptoms become serious. Note that the symbol 'Pos' indicates a positive result on the test. The symbol E indicates that the patient has Euparkeria. The symbol indicates that the patient does not have Euparkeria. Note: Ec is "E complement"               Pr (Pos| E) = .920                      Pr (E) = .0456               Pr (Pos| Ec) = .028                  Note: Pr (E) + Pr (Ec) =1               What is Pr (Pos O E)?

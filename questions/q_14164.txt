19.  A vessel was filled with NOCl gas until the concentration was 0.398 mol/liter.  The temperature of the system was increased to 245 oC and the system was allowed to undergo the reaction, 2NOCl(g)  2NO(g)  + Cl2(g), until equilibrium was attained.  The physical chemistry students did a calculation and found the [Cl2] at that point was 0.0225 mol/liter.  Calculate the value of Kc at that temperature.

Q# 30 In her 1960s research, Nancy Scheper-Hughes observed delayed attachment by mothers living under the harsh conditions of earlier decades. By 2011 the death rate for infants in northeast Brazil had decreased dramatically, following the introduction of a national health care system, a national cash transfer program (Bolsa Familia) and the municipal installation of water pipes. As the material conditions of everyday life changed, mothers in the shantytown of Alto do Cruzeiro no longer showed maternal indifference and no longer attributed life-aversion to their own infants. Instead they showed the kind of maternal caretaking and immediate attachment bonding seen in most cultural settings. The symbolic system also changed since mothers no longer talked about a saint wanting their young infant.

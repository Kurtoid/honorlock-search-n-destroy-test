A woman purchased a vineyard, financing a large part of the purchase price by a loan from an investor that was secured by a mortgage on the land. The mortgage agreement with the investor included an acceleration clause and further provided that a defaulting borrower waives her right to redeem once foreclosure proceedings have begun. The investor properly recorded his mortgage. Three years later, the woman needed additional money to upgrade her harvesting equipment. She obtained a loan from a friend, also secured by a mortgage on the land. The friend properly recorded her mortgage. The next year, there was an unusually dry season in the region and the vineyard yielded a poor harvest. The woman failed to make payments to either the investor or the friend. The balance on the loan from the investor was $100,000, and the balance on the loan from the friend was $15,000. The investor instituted foreclosure proceedings in a jurisdiction that provides a statutory right of redemption. The day before the judicial sale, the woman won a $60,000 prize in a wine competition. She quickly contacted the investor and offered to pay off both loans in full. Because the win at the competition had greatly increased the value of the property, the investor refused the woman's offer. The investor was hoping to buy the property at the judicial sale. If the woman seeks to force the investor to accept her offer, will she likely prevail?

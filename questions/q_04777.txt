Using the 4 factors of the Path-Goal Theory (3pts ea), analyze the following situation and provide suggestions for Darian in terms of the type of leadership he should provide. (8pts for suggestions)  Darian is the manager of a marketing firm in an urban area.  He has a team of 12 individuals who range from entry level to seasoned professionals. As with most organizations, Darian's staff includes highly motivated individuals who want to learn, improve and perform at a high level, somewhat stagnant employees who just go through the motions and wait for the weekend, and others somewhere in between.  One person in particular, Shonda, has been on Darian's mind a lot lately.  She is one that seems to just show up on time, get her work done, and go home.  Shonda doesn't seem very fulfilled in her job but performs at an acceptable level most of the time.  Her motivation seems pretty low, but in her defense, her job is somewhat mundane in that she spends most of her days just inputting jobs into a system. She has little interaction with the others in the office but seems to relish opportunities to interact with her colleagues when possible.  It is hard to tell if she has the competency or motivation to do more than data entry. Darian needs someone who can not only input jobs but to communicate effectively with customers and coordinate with sales and production to make sure they have all of the information needed to move the jobs through the system effectively and efficiently.

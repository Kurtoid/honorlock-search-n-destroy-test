Ethics of Sniping and Negotiating With disturbing regularity we hear of a person, usually a man, who takes his family hostage and provokes a standoff with the police. Often the man has a gun and fires shots out the window in the direction of the police. In some cases, members of the family are killed, bystanders wounded, and police officers shot. These hostage-takers usually have significant family problems, employment problems, substance abuse problems, and sometimes are mentally unstable. When surrounded by police, they have little to negotiate for other than to surrender because their loved ones are being held hostage with them. You are a hostage negotiator for the police department in the middle of such a situation in which you are talking by telephone with a man who is holding his own family hostage, is making unreasonable demands, and is shooting out the window. One bystander has already been hit by gunfire. After many hours of unsuccessful attempts to get the man to surrender, you are asked by your supervisor to try to lure the man near a window at the rear of the house because a police sharpshooter has a clear shot to that position. The intention is to kill the hostage-taker.  Evaluate the ethical concept of luring the hostage taker into a position to be shot. OR  Transplant or Prosecute? Michael Costin was knocked unconscious during a fight at a hockey rink and died. He had indicated that he wanted his heart donated as an organ transplant on his death, but the district attorney (DA) blocked the donation. Costin's death at the hockey rink resulted in a criminal prosecution of the other "hockey-dad" who assaulted him. On Costin's death, the charge against the defendant became manslaughter. The DA blocked the heart donation because she didn't want the defendant to claim at trial that Costin died of a preexisting heart condition rather than from the fight. The result of this decision was that it may have cost a heart patient the opportunity for a life-saving transplant. Doctors claimed that preserving (and not transplanting) Costin's heart offered little medical evidence because it was healthy--the heart would have been rejected if it was defective in any way. Several doctors believed it was clear that Costin died from head trauma and that his heart was fine. One physician declared, "It's very, very likely that, because of this decision, someone with heart disease died." However, a professor argued, "there is also the interest in making sure we have all the evidence necessary so that justice is served." The DA said that according to an EMT at the fight scene, "it was a possible heart attack [and] we didn't want to give the defense an issue at trial to allow them to say, 'We really don't know the cause of death'" to raise doubt in the minds of jurors.18  Should the wishes of the family play a role in assessing the cause of death?

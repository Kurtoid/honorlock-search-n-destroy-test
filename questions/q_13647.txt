5.    The arrested person must appear before a judge within 24 hours.a.    Trueb.    False
5. Determine the location/orientation of the image (using ray tracing method) of an inverted object located to the left and outside the focal length of a DCV.                                         6. An isosceles prism with an apex angle of 16.10 has an index of refraction of 2.5. Determine the minimum angle of deviation for this prism.                                       7. An object is located 210-cm to the left of a DCV with a 57-cm focal length. Determine: a) Image distance; b) Magnification c) Describe the image.                                       8. A PCV lens has a focal length of 52 cm and an index of 1.893. The lens is submerged in water (1.33). Determine the values for R1 and R2. Note: The concave surface is the 1st surface.                                         9. Determine the relative aperture for a 2.5" diameter lens, knowing that the focal length is 21.5 cm. What is the effect on the focal length if the relative aperture is increase for the same diameter lens?                                         10. You are handed a CX with a radius of curvature of 46 cm and an object is placed 40 cm in front of the mirror. a) What is the focal length? b) Where is the image located (determine q)? c) Is the image found in part b) real? Explain. d) Is the image larger or smaller than the object?  What is the magnification? e) Make a ray-trace diagram to locate the position and size of the image formed.                                         11. A two-lens system is made up of a diverging lens followed by a converging lens, each of focal length 250 mm. The system is used to form an image of an object 95 mm high, standing erect, 720 mm from the first lens. The two lenses are separated by a distance of 80 cm. Describe the image formed by this system.

The nurse prepares to mix two medications (vial A and B) in one syringe. Place the steps in correct order for how the nurse will perform the procedure. A) Inject a volume of air equal to the volume of medication to be withdrawn into vial A. B) Withdraw the required amount of medication from vial B. C) Draw up a volume of air equal to the volume of medications to be withdrawn from both vials A and B. D) Withdraw the needle from vial A and inject the remaining air into vial B. E) Withdraw the required amount of medication from vial A.

Section 6: Feasibility Analysis: Affordable Housing Front Door Model. Consider the Front Door Model for the affordable housing development from the Excel file, "UE AHP.xlsx", available on Canvas: /courses/230215/files/19151511?verifier=yhNugvMsyJuLEnvHKF3iqmMTgjAKVwHGF5HEro2V. It is the same file that you have used for the Affordable Housing Project.  The Federal Reserve Bank has been decreasing the interest rates in 2020. Correspondingly, the banks are charging lower interest rates on loans, the municipalities can issue debt at lower interest rates and the capitalization rates are going down. Revise the assumptions, used for the feasibility analysis in your Front Door Model, to reflect these changes.  Revise the interest rate on the loan to 5%, the capitalization rate to 5%, and the borrowing rate of the municipality for providing TIF to 2.5%.  All other assumptions are unchanged. Choose one option to indicate the best answer. Include your choices in the text box below. For example, you can write "1 A, 2 B, 3 C, 4 D". You can use any other format of the answer as long as your choices for each subquestion 1, 2, 3, 4 are clear. Answer the questions below using your new assumptions the interest rate on the loan, the capitalization rate and the borrowing rate of municipality for providing TIF: Only change the corresponding cells in the Front Door Model Excel file that are highlighted as green color.

An older adult patient diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia will be taking ferrous sulfate (Feosal).  The nurse will teach which of the required administration guidelines to the patient (select all that apply)? Correct answer: Take the tablets on an empty stomach if possible.                              Increase fluid intake and increase dietary fiber while taking this medication.                              If liquid preparations are used, dilute in water or juice and sip through a straw placed in back of the mouth.   Iron preparations should be taken on an empty stomach, diluted, and liquid taken through a straw.  Extra fluids and fiber will help prevent constipation.  Sustained release should NEVER be crushed or dissolved.  Iron does not have to be taken only at bedtime.

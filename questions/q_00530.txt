Question One: 40 minutes   Alva's Emporium is a retail store in a medium sized town in northern Oklahoma.  Alva's sells pretty much everything (like a Wal-Mart) and serves a large geographic area.  Alva's is actually a corporation named "Alva's Retail Emporium, Inc." and incorporated in Delaware.  All the stock of the corporation is owned by Alva Norman, and Alva makes the decisions.  Alva lives just over the border in Kansas.   Alva's had a line of credit from Giant Bank to provide working capital for its business.  The credit line was for amounts up to $500,000.  Alva's signed[1] a promissory note promising to repay the outstanding amount in installments beginning in August, 2020.  Alva's also signed a security agreement granting Giant Bank a security interest in "all inventory and equipment, now owned or acquired hereafter".  The transaction took place on June 30, 2018, and Giant Bank filed a financing statement on that date.   Alva's has been forced to close because of power outages on several occasions.  As a result, the store was not available to serve its clients when they really needed it--after severe weather.  So Alva decided that the store needed a generator.  A generator large enough to power the entire store, including equipment like freezers and refrigerators, would cost about $100,000, and Alva's did not have that much money to spare (even with the credit line from Giant Bank).     Friendly Oklahoma Bank (FOB) agreed to lend Alva's Emporium the money for the generator on condition that Alva's granted it a security interest in the generator.  Alva's signed a promissory note promising to repay the loan and a security agreement granting FOB a security interest in the generator, which was identified as "One Mighty Power Generator model number 24-798Q".  FOB then paid the loan money directly to the Mighty Power dealer.   FOB is planning to perfect its security interest by filing a financing statement.   Five Minutes for both:             A.  Where should FOB file the financing statement?               B.  What name should be listed as Debtor?   The generator transaction took place in June 2020 and FOB filed the financing statement on June 30, 2020.       In the October 2020 ice storm, a large tree fell on the store's generator, destroying it.  Alva's collected on its insurance policy and purchased a new generator.  The insurance company paid the generator dealer directly.   Meanwhile, Alva's has been repaying the line of credit to Giant Bank as required.  It made regular payments on the first day of each month beginning in August, 2020 through March 2021.  It is now May 2021 and Alva's missed its April and May payments to Giant Bank.  As a result, Alva's is now in default on its debt to Giant Bank.  Alva's has also failed to pay amounts it owes FOB, so all amounts that Alva's owes to Giant Bank and to FOB are now due.     Alva's filed for bankruptcy on May 5, 2021.   Answer only these questions:   C.  (15 minutes) As between Giant Bank and FOB, who has the prior claim to the generator?               D.  (5 minutes) Which state's law will govern the priority question in part C?   E.  (5  minutes) Can the bankruptcy trustee avoid the payments that Alva's made to Giant Bank on March 1 and April 1, 2020?     [1] Actually, Alva (the human) signed on behalf of Alva's, since a corporation doesn't have hands.

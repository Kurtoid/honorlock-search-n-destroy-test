A patient presents to her physician noting that she hasn't felt like herself lately and is depressed.  She has also gained 40 pounds over the last few months.  Her lab values indicate that she glucose intolerance, an increased cortisol level and is hypertensic.  What disorder is likely?
Describe the general path of the deep limb of the global conveyor circulation.  Where does it start, where does it go (focus only on the deep sea)?  Because deep water flow rates are very slow, it is difficult to monitor this pathway, but there are several tracers that provide evidence for this flow pattern.  - Describe one man-made and one natural tracer that provide evidence for the global conveyor circulation and explain what each tracer tells us about the conveyor circulation. - If the tracer varies along the flow path, explain how and why it varies.

The Orphan Hermit flew (wearing a mask!) to Beijing, China, a few weeks ago to visit one of his old CHM 2051 classmates, who had returned to China to serve as CEO of a new startup company building innovative cell phones.  Although Orphy didn't encounter many other hermits in Beijing, he did run into a few hermits hiking along the Great Wall. Orphy flew to Beijing in one of United Airlines' new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which use the highly efficient GEnx jet engine.  He talked to the pilot, who pointed out that a jet engine is a form of heat engine, just as is a power plant, but far more efficient.  Not only are the jet turbine materials designed to tolerate higher temperatures (~1300oC), the temperature at flight altitudes is much lower (-50oC) than the ambient temperature on the ground.  Indeed, jet engine efficiency is highest at the altitude of the tropopause, the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere, typically 15km (50,000 ft).    Orphy wondered why atmospheric temperature is lowest at this point.  Briefly, tell Orphy why the temperature of the atmosphere increases as you go further up into the stratosphere.

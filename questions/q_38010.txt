( 14 points)  For a typical Hawk-Dove game there are resources to be gained (e.g., food, mates, territories) that carry with them a payoff. Each of two players can choose to be aggressive, i.e., behave as a Hawk (H), or compromising, i.e., behave as Dove (D). If both players choose to engage in Hawk behavior, then they split the resources, but lose some payoff from injuries. If both players choose to behave as Doves, then they split the resources, but engage in some display of power that carries a display cost with it. Finally, if one player chooses to engage in Hawk behavior while the other chooses to behave as a Dove, then the player behaving as a Hawk gets all of the resources while the player behaving as a Dove leaves with no benefits and no costs. The resources available at a confrontation (e.g., food, mates, territories) are worth 30 payoff units.  The matrix for this scenario is below.  Determine the evolutionary equilibrium and its meaning.                                    H D   H  (-5, -5) (0, 15)   D (15, 0) (5, 5)

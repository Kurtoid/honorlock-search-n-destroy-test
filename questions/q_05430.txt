Three masses are connected to each other as shown in the picture below. The masses are ordered as such, m3>m2>m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m3>m2>m1"}. Both masses are hanging from ideal, frictionless, massless pulleys. The surface which mass m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"} is in contact with is horizontal and frictionless. What is the formula for the magnitude of the acceleration of the masses? Your answer should be entirely symbolic and depend on some combination of m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"}, m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"}, m3{"version":"1.1","math":"m3"}, numbers and universal constants. No other variables should appear in your answer. There should only be one answer as all masses accelerate at the same rate in this problem.

QUESTION #2   CASE ANALYSIS Analyze the Spanish class presented in the case study, according to the following topics. * Methodology/ approaches * Theoretical assumption of the teacher (empiricist or rationalist) * Task sequencing (Brandl, 2008): Input, assimilation, and task * Role of the instructor and learners * Role of L1 versus L2 * Role and type of feedback (explicit versus implicit) * Proficiency outcome prediction in terms of oral production, e.g., what learners would be able to produce at the end of the semester, if classes continue in this fashion.

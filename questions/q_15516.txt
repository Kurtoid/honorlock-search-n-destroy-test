1.        Draw the face centered cubic crystalline structure. Name a material having this crystal structure at room temperature.   2a.     Derive an expression to show the relationship between true strain and engineering strain.  b.          A bend test is used for a certain hard material. If the transverse rupture strength of the material is known to be 1000 MPa, what is the anticipated load at which the specimen is likely to fail, given that its dimensions are: width of cross section = 15 mm, thickness of cross section = 10 mm, and length = 60 mm?   3a.    The following data is available from an orthogonal cutting experiment. Depth of cut to = 0.2 mm, width of cut w = 2.5 mm, rake angle a = 0o, cutting speed V = 5 m/s, Chip thickness tc = 0.5 mm, Cutting force Fc = 900 N, Thrust force Ft =750 N. Determine shear angle ph, friction coefficient u and friction angle b.  b.         From experimentation, the following values have been determined:                         V1 =  320 fpm                         T1 =  4.5 min                         V2 =  293 fpm                         T2 =  6.0 min                         Find n and C for Taylor's tool life equation.   4a.       A lathe is set up to machine a bar stock 120 mm in diameter. A cut is made with an initial depth of cut of 4 mm at a feed rate of 0.250 mm/rev and at a spindle speed of 150 rpm. Calculate the metal removal rate.  b.         Distinguish  between climb  milling  and  up  milling.  Which  one  is  more  energy  efficient  and why?  c.        Discuss  the use of "Drill jig" in hole making.   5a.        What is Group Technology?    b.         List any three benefits of Group Technology.  c.         Comment on the problems in implementing Group Technology.   6a.        Explain the importance of Friability in abrasive machining.  b.         Discuss the reasons for high specific energy consumption in grinding process.  c.         Give any two ways to reduce the temperature rise while grinding.  d.         How will you select a grinding wheel to optimize the surface finish?

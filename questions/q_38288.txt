Answer the following questions based on the excerpt provided from a journal article, which details the analysis of heavy metal contamination in chocolates from Brazil.Abstract: Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) concentrations and their relationship to the cocoa content of chocolates commercialized in Brazil were evaluated by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF AAS) after microwave-assisted acid digestion.Instrumentation. All measurements were carried out using an AAnalyst 600 atomic absorption spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Norwalk, CT) with Zeeman background correction that was equipped with a transversely heated graphite tube atomizer and an AS-800 autosampler. Electrodeless discharge lamps for Cd and Pb were operated at 230 and 440 mA, respectively. The selected wavelengths were 228.8 nm for Cd and 283.3 nm for Pb. Aliquots of 20 iL of the samples and calibration solutions were injected with 5 iL of chemical modifier directly into the graphite tube.Excerpts from: Villa, J. et al. "Cadmium and lead in chocolates commercialized in Brazil." J. Agric. Food Chem., 2014, 62, 8759-8763a. What are the analytes and the samples?b. What is the source on the atomic absorption instrument?c. What is the atomization technique used? d. What type of sample preparation was employed? e. Magnesium nitrate, Mg(NO3)2, was added to each sample after it was prepared. What might have been the purpose of this addition?.

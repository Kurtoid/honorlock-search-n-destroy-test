You can use MATLAB either through UF Apps or if you have student license downloaded version of it. Here is the link for UF Apps: LINK For a given phrase, write a program to replace all the occurrences of a word with another word of user's choice. The user inputs the phrase, the word to be replaced and the new word. Display the new phrase. Assume that the phrase does not contain any punctuation marks. Note: You are not allowed to use functions like strrep(), strsplit(), strfind() etc. You can use the functions we have discussed in the class.  phrase = input('Enter phrase: ', 's');replace = input('Word to be replaced: ', 's');nword = input('New replacement word: ', 's'); Test Case 1:Enter phrase: One fish Two fish Red Fish Blue fishyWord to be replaced: fishNew replacement word: pigOutput: One pig Two pig Red Fish Blue fishy Note: in this test case-1, the program replaces all 'fish' with 'pig' but not 'Fish' (since 'Fish' is not same as 'fish') or 'fishy' (since 'fishy' is also not 'fish'. So all the words which are to be replaced have to be exactly same as given by the user.  Test Case 2: Enter phrase: fishfish green fish Word to be replaced: fishNew replacement word: pigOutput: fishfish green pig Note: in this test case-2, the program replaces 'fish' with 'pig' but not 'fishfish' (since 'fishfish' is not same as 'fish'). So all the words which are to be replaced have to be exactly same as given by the user. Test Case 3:Enter a phrase: Hello world the world has worldWord to be replaced: worldNew replacement word: GainesvilleOutput: Hello Gainesville the Gainesville has Gainesville   Test Case 4:Enter a phrase: a b c a z a AWord to be replaced: aNew replacement word: matlabOutput: matlab b c matlab z matlab A   Test Case 5:Enter a phrase: cat dog pig ant cowWord to be replaced: fishNew replacement word: horseOutput: cat dog pig ant cow

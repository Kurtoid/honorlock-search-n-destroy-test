A 47-year-old, married, male named Rick Harrison presents to the ED at 2223 hours. He is an engineer for a large firm in the United States. He stated that he recently came back from a business trip in Central Asia where he had been working on a new water infrastructure project. He states that he worked mainly outdoors, supervising project sites. Rick also says he felt fine for most of the trip, but shortly, before leaving to travel home, he felt a little sick. Upon further questioning, the patient states that he decided to come to the ED because, over the past few days, he had a persistent headache that had become unbearable; and his wife stated that he had become slightly confused and disoriented that evening. Another issue Rick has is nausea, to the point where he has been vomiting, which further exacerbates his headaches. The patient, when asked, states that he has been more tired than usual, and has been experiencing diarrhea. The patient's vital signs are stable, yet elevated, at this time with normal oxygen saturation. The physician discovered that the patient also has neck swelling and stiffness. What is Mr. Harrison's chief complaint?

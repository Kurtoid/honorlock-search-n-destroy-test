I understand that once I begin the quiz, I CANNOT have a cell phone, tablet, second computer, notes, books  etc. in my work area. My desk area is completely clean with the exception of NO MORE THAN FOUR (4) BLANK sheets of scratch paper, my calculator and a pen/pencil. I may NOT have an ENTIRE NOTEBOOK on my desk. I MUST show my desk AND do a 360-degree room scan with the camera on my computer to prove that I do not have any prohibited items on my desk. I MUST also pick up ALL pieces of blank scratch paper and show BOTH sides of them to the camera. If you have not already done so, show the camera your desk area AND do a 360-degree room scan. Also, pick up ALL pieces of blank scratch paper and show both sides of them to the camera.  Note: if you do not do a 360-degree scan, you WILL be penalized. Anything less than 360 degrees leaves the possibility that you have another device or notes sitting in the area you did not show and I HAVE seen students attempt to get away with this.  Violation of any of the above will result in a minimum 20 point penalty, up to forfeiture of ALL points earned.

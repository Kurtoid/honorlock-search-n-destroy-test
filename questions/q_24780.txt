DIRECTIONS  You will have 90 min from the start of this exam to complete it. Note that with this exam software I can only randomize answers for ALL questions (not individual questions), so for questions that have ABCD types of responses, the answers are still randomized, so make sure to find the correct one.  I try to label as clearly as possible.  Don't talk about or post about the exam until the professor says it is ok to do so (honor code violation).  Piazza should be shut down for the period of the exam to reduce inadvertent posting. For this exam, you are allowed a pencil/pen and a blank sheet of paper to work out problems.  You are NOTallowed a calculator nor any other notes, books, or other reference materials (written nor web-based).   You are only allowed to use the electronic device on which you are taking this exam for the sole purpose of taking the exam.  Do NOT use headphones; I can't tell what you are listening to. You only get 1 submission! So make sure you are finished when you submit.  Choose the BEST answer!

Read the following scenario and answer the question below. Human activities, including fossil fuel combustion, farming, and deforestation, are known to increase the levels of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides in our atmosphere. Measurable warming of Earth due to these greenhouse gases can alter ecosystem dynamics. In addition to the direct climatic effects on organisms within biomes, warming can lower levels of sea ice and increase precipitation in Arctic areas. Global warming can also melt permafrost in the tundra and increase sea surface temperatures, which could increase the intensity of hurricanes in vulnerable areas. Within communities, climatic change can shift interdependent species "out of sync," potentially causing indirect loss of species. For example, if pollinators and the plants they pollinate become out of synch, the pollinators may not be able to switch to a different food source, and the plants may not be able to reproduce. Intense hurricanes resulting from global warming can directly lead to ________ within communities.

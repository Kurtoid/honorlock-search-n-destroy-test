The simulation begins with 300 beetles, divided equally among red, tan, and brown variants, and with equal numbers of males and females. The simulation assumes that female beetles each lay 50 eggs in each reproduction cycle, and that individual beetles live for at most 2 reproductive cycles. The table shows the numbers of each beetle variant over 7 reproduction cycles. Only adult beetles are counted.

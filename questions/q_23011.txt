Fact Pattern 2 Diego met Frida when she was still an art student.   Though Diego was significantly older than Frida, the two moved in together despite Frida's parents' disapproval and started an art importing and exporting business using Diego's funds and art connections.  After living together and working together in the business for 7 years, Diego and Frida decide to marry.   Frida's family insists that the couple execute a prenuptial agreement.  Each party hires an attorney; several drafts are exchanged over a two month period.  The parties procrastinate and provide their lawyers with financial disclosures that have accounts listed, including their importing/exporting business accounts, but no values.  Frida's financial disclosure lists real estate she inherited from her grandfather.  Diego's financial disclosure lists a bank account at Detroit Industry Bank containing funds accumulated during his years as an art professor at the university (before he met Frida).   However, due to Frida and Diego's preoccupation with art (and not legal matters), Frida signs the agreement 4 days before the wedding.  Diego--who is furiously working on finishing a mural to commemorate the nuptials--separately signs two days later with his paint brush, anxious to return to his masterpiece and barely listening to his attorney.  The prenuptial agreement states that neither party shall pay spousal support to the other and that each party will retain the assets titled to him or her in the event of a divorce.   During the parties' marriage, both Diego and Frida become wildly successful artists in addition to the importing/exporting business.  The parties have reasonably equivalent incomes from their artwork.  Frida sells the real estate inherited from her grandfather, transfers the proceeds into an account in her name, and uses those funds to buy a painting by an up-and-coming artist named Pablo.  Diego periodically deposits proceeds from the sale of his artwork into his Detroit Industry Bank account and uses some of those funds to pay for the parties' frequent travel to Europe.   After 20 years of marriage--which Frida considers to really be 27 years--Frida declared that she could only be married to her art and informed Diego she was seeking a divorce in Ohio.   5. Diego elects to challenge the validity of the parties' prenuptial agreement, whereas Frida asserts that it is valid and enforceable.   a. What are the factors the Court must consider in determining the validity of the prenuptial agreement? (3 points; 150 word limit) b. Who has the burdens of proof for each factor? (2 points; 60 word limit)

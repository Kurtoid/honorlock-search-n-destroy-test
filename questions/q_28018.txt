As an alternative to the previous drop-down menu question, please type the following paragraph into the essay answer for this question and fill in the blanks. Alternatively, you can make a list of 1-14 representing the blanks and enter the correct word next to the number. Please do not answer both the drop-down menu version in the previous question and this version. Only one of the two questions will be graded. In the early stages of the digestive process, acetylcholine released by the vagus nerve, stimulates the (1)________________ cell to release gastrin, which then stimulates the enterochromaffin-like cell to produce (2)__________________ which stimulates the (3)__________________ cell to produce HCl. The secretion of H+ to the gastric lumen involves the movement of intracellular vesicles containing the enzyme (4)___________________ to the surface to fuse with the apical plasma membrane. The lower gastric pH causes (5)_______________________ from the Chief cell to convert to its active form (6)___________________. The lower gastric pH also stimulates the D cells to produce (7)______________________, which inhibits gastrin release and enacts a regulatory control of the process. When the acidic chyme enters the small intestine, the lower pH (~pH 4) stimulates mucosal cells to produce (8)________________  which inhibits gastrin release and also stimulates the pancreas to release  (9)___________ and (10)___________ into the pancreatic duct, thus facilitating the movement of zymogens. Pancreatic acinar cells are signaled to release zymogen granules by the duodenal peptide hormone (11)___________________________, which also stimulates the (12)_________________ to release bile.  Because of the secretions from the pancreatic duct, the pH in the duodenum is (13) (decreased or increased?) ______________, thereby facilitating the processing of zymogens such as proelastase or procarboxypeptidase by the enzyme (14)_______________________ to their active forms in the duodenum.

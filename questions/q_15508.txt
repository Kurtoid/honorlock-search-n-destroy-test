When Dr. Wanna B. Cowboy graduated last year he was fortunate to take his first job with Bumper Crop Cattle feeders in Texas. Shortly after that, the Bumper brothers decided to diversify their company and bought a mid-sized 11,000-sow swine production company in Iowa. Since Dr. Cowboy is a licensed veterinarian and is already on the payroll, he is recognized as the swine health expert in the company and since 11,000 sows hardly justifies a full-time veterinarian, a condition of his employment is that he will be the swine vet for the foreseeable future.

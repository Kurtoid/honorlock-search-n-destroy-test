Protect hearing when working with outdoor equipment "Noise-induced hearing loss can have life-impacting consequences. With the use of hearing protection devices, however, we can enjoy the benefits or motorized tools and still preserve our precious hearing. How hearing loss occurs: Sound waves create vibrations in our ears. The vibrations ripple through the bones of the middle ear, into fluid of the inner ear, and move onto a membrane studded with hair cells. Microscopic projections on the hair cells bump up and down and translate sound waves into electrical signals that make sense of the sound in our brains. Loud sounds damage and kill the hair cells, which don't grow back. Our hearing is at risk from sounds that are 85 decibels (dB) and louder. The louder sound is, the quicker hearing damage can happen. In some cases, one extremely loud noise, like an explosion, causes sudden, permanent hearing loss.  Prolonged or repeated exposure to noise over 85 dB causes gradual hearing loss that may be hard to notice. It can also cause tinnitus, a sense of buzzing in one or both ears or a roaring sound in the head, that can be hard to tune out.

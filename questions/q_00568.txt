6. Each year seasoned mountaineers as well as many novice climbers looking for a once in a lifetime experience attempt the hardest endurance climb in the lower 48 states.  The glaciated peek of Mt. Rainier, located outside of Seattle Washington, stands at 14,411 feet.  From one of the more popular high camps, Camp Muir at 10,100', climbers start their 8-12 hour push for the summit in the early morning hours (between 1am and 4am), climbing in the darkness by the light of their headlamps.  A study was conducted to see if the length of time to run 5 miles at sea level could be used to predict the length of time to reach the summit.  A random sample of 16 mountaineers was selected and data on the length of time (in minutes) to run 5 miles (x) and the length of time (in hours) to reach the summit (y) was used to fit a straight-line model.  The results of the simple linear regression are provided below.

Your patient is a 25 year old female with a history of low back pain. She reports the pain began after lifting a heavy box while moving things around her home.  She states the pain is intermittent, made worse by standing and walking and better when sitting.  She states the pain is located primarily in her upper lumbar spine and sometimes she feels the pain in her thoracic spine.  During your objective exam, the patient performs prone hip extension. What would indicate weakness of the left lumbar multifidi?
A repeated-measures study comparing two treatments with a sample of n = 4 participants produces a mean of M = 18 with SS = 24 for the scores in the first treatment, a mean of M = 14 with SS = 18 for the scores in the second treatment, and a mean of M = 4 with SS = 12 for the difference scores.  What is the estimated standard error for the sample mean difference?
Sometimes a behavioral event can occur at the same time as a cognitive process, even though the behavior isn't needed for the cognitive process. For example, many people look toward the ceiling when thinking about a complex problem, even though "thinking" would likely continue if they didn't look up. This describes a(n)

Consider the following 1-dimensional data points along a number line: -4, -1, 5, 7 , 10, 14, 24, 27, 32, 34, 38 Now consider the DBSCAN algorithm for density based clustering. Assume an epsilon value of 7 and MinPoints value of 3 (including the query point). Answer the following questions. (a) (6) Mark each point as Core, Border, or Noise.   (b) (6) What are the density-based clusters that are formed in the context of the data provided above?   (c) (4) How would you find good number of clusters in the context of DBSCAN algorithm?

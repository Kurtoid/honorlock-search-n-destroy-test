Sneaky Snakes During the 1940s, military ships from the South Pacific accidentally introduced brown tree snakes from Australia to the island of Guam. These snakes eat birds, lizards, and small mammals in their native range of Australia. Since no species on Guam eats the snakes, their population has grown rapidly.  Researchers estimate that two million tree snakes now inhabit the island. So far, 10 species of birds and 5 species of lizards have disappeared from Guam; small mammals have also decreased in abundance.   Use this information and your knowledge about biology to answer questions 11-15.   11. Since the brown tree snake is a keystone species in Guam, it must also be a keystone species in Australia.

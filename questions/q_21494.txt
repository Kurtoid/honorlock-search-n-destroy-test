Please reference the following two poems to answer the essay question that follows. To Wordsworth  By Percy Bysshe Shelley    Poet of Nature, thou hast wept to know  That things depart which never may return:  Childhood and youth, friendship and love's first glow,  Have fled like sweet dreams, leaving thee to mourn.  These common woes I feel. One loss is mine                  5 Which thou too feel'st, yet I alone deplore.  Thou wert as a lone star, whose light did shine  On some frail bark in winter's midnight roar:  Thou hast like to a rock-built refuge stood  Above the blind and battling multitude:                       10 In honoured poverty thy voice did weave  Songs consecrate to truth and liberty,--  Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve,  Thus having been, that thou shouldst cease to be. Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways  By William Wordsworth       Motions and means, on land and sea at war   With old poetic feeling, not for this,   Shall ye, by poets even, be judged amiss!   Nor shall your presence, howsoe'er it mar   The loveliness of Nature, prove a bar                        5  To the mind's gaining that prophetic sense   Of future change, that point of vision whence   May be discovered what in soul ye are.   In spite of all that beauty may disown   In your harsh features, Nature doth embrace         10  Her lawful offspring in man's art; and Time,   Pleased with your triumphs o'er his brother Space,   Accepts from your bold hands the proffered crown   Of hope, and smiles on you with cheer sublime. Essay Question:"Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways" is an example of William Wordsworth's later work.  Considering the tone and content of the poem, discuss your beliefs regarding whether or not Percy Shelley was justified in his sentiments expressed in "To Wordsworth."  In your answer, be sure to consider the philosophic attitudes, subject matter, and techniques that were distinctive to the Romantic Movement.

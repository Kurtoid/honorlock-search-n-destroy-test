There are two parts to this question.  You must answer both parts to get full credit. 1) Skeletal muscle can generate ATP via aerobic respiration and/or via anaerobic respiration (AKA lactic acid fermentation). Compare and contrast those two methods of generating ATP.  I am looking for at least ONE (1) similarity and at least THREE (3) differences. Please keep in mind that I don't care about specific parts of the metabolic pathway (for example, I am not asking you to diagram the Citric Acid Cycle). Instead focus on when each type is used, what is required for their use, what muscle fibers use them, and so on. If you learned about the specific steps of these pathways in another class, THAT IS NOT WHAT I AM ASKING FOR HERE. Focus on the stuff we talked about. 2) How are these two methods of generating ATP different from direct phosphorylation with creatine phosphate?

Assume that a class called ACunit has been declared with a private attribute called status (a boolean) that stores whether the ACunit is off (false) or on (true). The class also has a private attribute called serviceHours (an integer). The class has getters and setters for both attributes and a default constructor that initializes both attributes. Furthermore, the class has the following method: public void decreaseHours(int amount) {    serviceHours = serviceHours - amount;}   Assume that the main method of the driver contains the code that declares and creates an ACunit variable called roomAC. Write code for the main method that checks whether the roomAC is on or off. If it is on, then your code should turn it off, and decrease its serviceHours by 3.

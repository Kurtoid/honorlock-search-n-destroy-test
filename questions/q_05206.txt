Perry and Felce (2003) conducted a study to examine the association between the quality of life (QOL) of adults with intellectual disabilities living in residential homes and the types of operational procedures used in their residential settings.  QOL was measured on a Likert scale (0 = low to 7 = high) and operational procedures was measured on a Likert scale using the Residential Services Working Practices Scale (RSWPS) which assessed the presence of operational procedures involving individual planning, assessment and teaching of individuals with intellectual disability (0 = no or few procedures to 7 = significant procedures). a) What is one testable research question that addresses the aim(s) of this study? b) What analysis should be conducted to test the above research question? c) Which variables should be included in the above-mentioned analysis (be specific)?
Enzymes are [not_consumed] by the reaction they catalyze.  Heat and pH changes may [denature] killing its activity. Enzyme inhibitors can also interfere with activity. For instance, the antibiotic Trimethoprim exerts its effect on bacteria by being a folic acid [analogue]. Folic acid is important for cell process such as synthesis, repair, and methylation of DNA. When administered to a patient with a bacterial infection, Trimethoprim will enter the bacterial cell and block the enzyme [active_site] intended for folic acid. This interference is called [competitive_inhibition]. Trimethoprim prevents the normal metabolic process in the bacteria with an outcome of cellular death.

5. A silicon Hall sensor (n-doped) has a rectangular structure with length = 300 mm, width = 100mm and the thickness = 20 mm. If a magnet is brought near it such that the field is 0.05 weber/m2 directed along the thickness direction, and a current of 10 milliamperes is passing through the cross-section (width x thickness), how much Hall voltage would you expect to measure? The density of charge carriers, n = 5x1021 m-3. Using a diagram indicate the direction of the Hall field. Briefly discuss with a diagram how a Hall liquid-level sensor works.   h = 6.63x10-34 J-sec        c = 3x108 m/s           e = 1.6x10-19 Coulomb      1 psi = 0.006895 MPa            me = 9.1x10-31 kg                1 eV = 1.6x10-19 J

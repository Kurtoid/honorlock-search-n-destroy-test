Would you expect loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding each of the following proteins to be an enhancer (E) or suppressor (S) of the sev mutation? An enhancer mutation makes the effect of the original mutation worse, whereas a suppressor mutation alleviates it. Note that loss-of-function mutations can be just partial defects and not necessarily null mutations.

Here is the same excerpt from the Texas Supreme Court decision in Alex Sheshunoff Management Services, L.P. v. Johnson:   ASM sued Johnson, alleging breach of the covenant not to compete and seeking injunctive relief and damages.  Strunk intervened.  The court granted a temporary injunction.  Strunk and Johnson then moved for summary judgment, arguing that the covenant was unenforceable as a matter of law.  They argued that under footnote six of Light, 883 S.W.2d at 645 n.6 (discussed below), ASM's promises to provide confidential information and specialized training were illusory at the time the agreement was made and the covenant was therefore unenforceable.  The district court granted the summary judgment motions. The court then entered a final judgment.  The court of appeals affirmed.   Why does the Court provide the information in this excerpt? (There is one correct answer.)

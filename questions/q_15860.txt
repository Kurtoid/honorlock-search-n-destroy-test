After consulting with her physician, Betty Black is given a prescription called Sectral (acebutolol) for her hypertension. Betty did not ask her doctor any questions about her new medication because she was worried about her newly discovered high blood pressure. After leaving her physician's office, Mrs. Black went to her local pharmacy. The pharmacist asks if she would prefer the generic form because it is less expensive than the prescribed brand name. Betty agrees to use the generic form of Sectral called acebutolol. Before checking out at the register, Betty is asked if she would like to be educated about her new medication. The pharmacy tech explains that if she declines counseling from the pharmacist that she will have to place a checkmark in the decline box and sign her name that she declined any further advice. Being new to this drug and feeling overwhelmed, she opts for the counseling. Betty is taken to a small room where nobody can overhear her case, which would be a violation of HIPAA. The pharmacist explains that her new medicine is a beta blocker that will help lower her high blood pressure. This drug class is used to decrease the heart rate and blood pressure, placing less stress on your heart and reducing the chance of a heart attack or stroke. Betty asks, "How does that work?" The pharmacist says that the drug blocks a chemical called epinephrine, more commonly known as adrenaline, from exciting the heart. She explains, "The doctor ordered you to take one pill once a day in the morning by mouth. For the drug to take full effect, it will take a few weeks, so don't miss any doses. However, if you forget to take a dose or cannot remember if you took a pill, do not take another until the next day to prevent any serious side effects that may cause serious harm." Betty agrees and is satisfied with what she has learned and she thanks the pharmacist for her time. The prescribed drug is a beta blocker. A beta blocker is associated with which of the following terms?

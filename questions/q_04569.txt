This question is to be worked neatly on paper while Part 1 of the test is still open.   Once you close Part 1, take a pic and upload on Part 2.  You have a choice of solving either Option 1 or Option 2.  Be sure you submit an answer to only one of the problems.  There is no additional credit for solving both, nor will I grade both and give you the better score.  You must choose one and submit a solution to the one problem you choose. Option 1: A company needs to design a cylindrical can that has a total volume of 215 cubic inches.  The material for the top and bottom cost $0.003 per square inch and the side of the can requires material that costs $0.001 per square inch.  Determine the dimensions that will minimize the total cost of the can.  Clearly report the total cost per can as well as the height and diameter. Option 2: A trash company is designing an  open-top, rectangular container with a square base that will have a volume of 625 cubic feet.  The cost of making the bottom of the container is  $5 per square  foot, and the cost of the sides is  $4 per square foot. Find the dimensions of the container that will minimize total cost. Be sure you clearly show all work and VERIFY you have a minimum.  Circle the sentence that states the total cost as well as the dimensions of the height and diameter (Option 1) or the total cost as well as the width, height and length (Option 2).  Clearly state the total cost as well as the dimensions.  Watch the units on your answers!

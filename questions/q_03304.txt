On May 1, Bob the Barkeep places an order by telephone for 2000 cases of various dry beers at $17/case for immediate delivery.  The sales manager at Larry's Liquors takes the order.  Bob follows up on the phone call by filling out a written order form, confirming the sale that had been negotiated over the phone.  He faxes the form to Larry's Liquors. On May 3, Larry himself writes back to Bob.  Larry is sorry to have to report that all of his dry beer stocks are already committed to other customers, and so he would have to order more.  It will take at least two months for a delivery, and because demand for dry beer is spiking, it will cost more like $25/case.  If Bob were to claim that he already has a contract for twenty cases of dry beer at $17 and threatens to sue, what result?

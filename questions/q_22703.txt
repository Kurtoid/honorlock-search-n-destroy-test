ACME COMPANY NARRATIVE:  1.  You are a new Field Salesperson for ACME Safe Company and you are replacing Wilbur Haag who was promoted to a National Account Manager position. 2.  You've been assigned an existing sales territory with Wholesale Distributor customers who sell safes to other businesses. 3.  This is your first trip around your territory visiting with your customers and prospective customers. 4.  ACME has the #1 market share (~35% nationally but varies from market to market) of the small, less expensive (and lower margin: ~20% nationally) business safes. 5.  ACME has a strong #2 market share (~24% nationally but varies from market to market) of the larger, more expensive (and higher margin: ~55% nationally) business safes. 6.  ACME has recently introduced an expanded line of large, high margin safes with intention of growing this category's market share. 7.  Additionally, a functional pricing discount program for ACME's large, high margin safes has been recently introduced for those ACME distributors that carry both the small & large safes AND agree not to sell/stock competitive safe brands. This often results in customer gross margins for small and large safes to exceed 22% and 40%, respectively. 8.  This new pricing program includes discounts for quantity buys, minimum stock-on-hand, and annual sales mix of high margin products. ACCOUNT SITUATION:                                                1.  You are meeting for the first time with ACME's Birmingham wholesale distributor, Warehouse Equipment & Supply Company (WESCo) that buys and re-sells ACME small safes to businesses. 2.  WESCo has been a highly profitable ACME customer for 5 years. 3.  You are meeting with the WESCo's Manager, Arne Anderson who has been with WESCo for 6 years and has a reputation for liking the ACME brand and products and works well with our sales organization. 4.  ACME has one other distributor in the Birmingham market, Birmingham Office Products, but does not stock our small or large safes and occasionally buys our small safes as needed for their customers. 5.  ACME data indicates that the market for small, low cost safes has seen modest growth since 2017 of 8.6%. 6.  ACME customer data indicates that WESCo's purchases ($) of ACME small, low cost safes has seen a decline since 2017 of 5.2%. 7.  Although Arne is a fan of ACME products, WESCo has bought and stocked LOCKRIGHT) large safes driven primarily by ACME's lack of a complete line of large safes for WESCo's customers. DATA GATHERED FROM CUSTOMER VISIT: Arne's not sure if it's competitor pressures, but does know his price from ACME has gone up each year that he's been a customer.  Wilbur told Arne that WESCo's current small safe GM% of 12% in the Birmingham market was very reasonable for an ACME account with a strong small safe market share. He does acknowledge that his LOCKRIGHT sales rep stops by often to manage his inventory including making purchase recommendations to keep the right product in stock.   He also noted that he has a strong large safe market share of 25%, and achieves a 20% gross margin on these large safe sales. Q1:  Select the "BEST 5" OBSERVATIONS from the data tables & any numerical data from the narratives. (15pts)   Best OBSERVATIONS...are those that have the most significant positive or negative impact on maximizing WESCo's sales of ACME products! A)  WESCo's small safe purchases ($s) are down 5.2% since 2017... verses the Birmingham market that is up 8.6% during that same period.  B)  ACME's GM% for the WESCo account (29.5%) has increased each of the last 3 years and significantly exceeds ACME's national average of 20%.  C)  WESCo's small safe market share has declined each year since 2017.  D)  The Birmingham large safe market has grown 16.4% since 2017.  E)  Approximately 70% of the Birmingham safe sales to businesses are from the sale of large safes.  F)  WESCo's large safe market share is currently 25%... very similar to ACME's 24% large safe national market share.  G)  WESCo's earning a 12% GM on their ACME branded small safes... while ACME's "single source" accounts often exceed 22%. H)  ACME small safe national market share is 35% compared to WESCo's market share of 31.8% a drop from 34.8% in 2017.  I)  ACME earns a national average of 55% GM on it's sale of large safes, and 20% GM on their sales of small safes. J)  WESCo's earning 20% GM on their sale of LOCKRIGHT large safes... compared to ACME's "single source" customers earning up to 40% GM.

Madison Construction produces two products, steel beams and wood beams.  Management desires that its product mix of beams maximize weekly total contribution margin.  Direct labor is limited to 2,500 hours per week and machine hours are limited to 1,000 hours per week.  The maximum demand for steel beams is 95 beams per week; while the maximum demand for wood beams is 100 beams per week.  Other data for the beams appear below.   Additionally, total weekly beam production cannot exceed 175 beams due to storage constraints.     Steel Beams Wood Beams   Contribution margin per beam $220 $150   Direct labor hours per  beam 130 170   Machine hours per beam 80 120    Below is a partially completed linear program model that seeks to optimize (i.e., maximizes weekly total contribution margin) the product mix of steel and wood beams.  Fill in the blanks in the partially completed model using variables S, W and TCM which are defined as follows as well as the data provided above.  Please note: you are not being asked to solve the model, only to fill in the blanks to properly state the model.  S = number/quantity of steel beams and  W = number/quantity of wood beams and TCM = total contribution margin  The objective function is TCM = $[variable1]S + $[variable2]W  The constraints are:  Direct labor constraint is: [variable3]S + [variable4]W

(Hornecker Dyslipidemia) Six months ago, HL, a 47 year-old male, was started on atorvastatin 10 mg qd for the following lipid profile:          TC      301               HbA1c          7.8%          LDL    189               FPG 141          HDL    38          TG     372 He is now following up in clinic after having routine labs drawn for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, gout, and depression.  HL indicates that he has been extremely stressed lately, his diet has been poor, and he has not been compliant with his diabetes medications.  Most labs were WNL with the following exceptions:          TC      308                                 HbA1c          9.5%            LDL    175 (by fractionation)     FPG 195                 HDL    34                                               TG     497 HL agrees to see the registered dietitian and diabetes educator, and promises to be more compliant with his medications.  His Pooled Cohort estimated 10-year ASCVD risk is 8.5%. At this time, what modifications to HL's drug therapy would be most appropriate?

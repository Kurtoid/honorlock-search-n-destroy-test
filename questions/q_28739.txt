By accident, a researcher had increased the temperature in one of the incubators in the laboratory from 30 degrees Celsius (86degF) to 50 degrees Celsius (122degF).

When the researchers studied the culture more they discovered that the microorganism was able to form endospores. How would you classify this microorganism?

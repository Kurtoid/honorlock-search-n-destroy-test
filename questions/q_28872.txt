(25 pts) Iron is body centered cubic (BCC) material, which has the favorable slip system {110}.  The critical resolved shear stress is 27.5 MPa. (a) An engineer is doing tensile test on a single crystal iron.  The stress of 35 MPa is applied along [001] direction. (a-1) please calculate the resolved shear stress of the slip along    (a-2) determine whether the dislocation slip will take place.   (b) If this engineer performs the tensile test along [001] direction on single crystal iron, (b-1) draw the general look of the stress-strain curve; (b-2) explain the mechanistic causes of the different stages; (b-3) explain how temperature affects these stages; (b-4) explain how stacking fault energy affects these stages; (b-5) If multiple slip systems were activated, how does the stress-strain curve look like?

Placozoan evolutionary relationships to other animals are currently unclear, and different phylogenies can be created, depending on the characters used to infer relatedness. Placozoans are multicellular invertebrates with a simple structure of only two tissue layers and only four cell types. They have the smallest amount of DNA measured in any animal. In comparison, sponges have no tissues but about 20 cell types. One species of placozoans, Tp (Trichoplax adhaerens), produces a neuropeptide almost identical to one found in cnidarians. The genome of Tp, although the smallest of any known animal, shares many features of complex eumetazoan (even human!) genomes. The next three questions refer to the phylogenetic trees that follow. In the trees, the outgroup is a taxon that is outside the group of interest; members of the group of interest are more closely related to one another than to the outgroup.      Which tree(s) has (have) been created by emphasizing the genomic features of placozoans?
Reduction is the process of

Fructose intolerance is a serious genetic condition which is caused by a mutation in the gene for Fructose 1-phosphate aldolase. When this enzyme is defective in liver, ingesting fructose depletes the liver cell of ATP due to the activity of Fructokinase. Removal of available ATP in the liver cells leads to cell death and liver damage. Individuals with this condition must severely limit their intake of fructose. Below is the metabolic pathway for fructose metabolism in the liver. What is the key glycolytic regulatory enzyme that is bypassed in fructose catabolism?

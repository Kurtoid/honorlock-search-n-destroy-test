The sugar molecule D-allose can exist in an open-chain and a ring form (referred to as D-allopyranose, shown below). When the open chain form of D-allose is converted to the ring form, a new chiral center (referred to as the anomeric carbon) is formed. This produces two stereoisomers: the a-anomer and the b-anomer of D-allopyranose (shown below).  In the LEAST stable chair form of D-allopyranose, would the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) group be axial or equatorial? You can disregard the anomeric OH group to answer this question. [axeq] Which of the two anomers of D-allopyranose is MORE stable? Note that the more stable anomer can assume the more stable chair conformation. [stableanomer] Which of the following options best describes the isomeric relationship between the two anomers of D-allopyranose? [relationship]

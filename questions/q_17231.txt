(twenty points) Aaron, a single person, had executed a will in 2000, leaving everything equally to his two daughters. In 2009, he decided to leave half his estate to Oklahoma City University School of Law, with the other half split equally between the two daughters, or 25% each, so he executed a new will that explicitly revoked the 2000 will and made those provisions. After executing each of these wills, he took the originals home, and his attorney retained a photocopy. He later heard that a trust was a better vehicle for disposing of his estate, so he went to a new attorney and created a revocable trust in 2018. According to the terms of the trust document, Aaron was the sole lifetime beneficiary, and at his death, his property was to be distributed 45% to each daughter and the remaining 10% to Oklahoma City University School of Law. Aaron's new attorney did not prepare a pourover will or any other documents. Before he died, Aaron told told several friends orally that he was holding all his assets in trust for the beneficiaries named in the trust, and that he tore up his 2009 will because he no longer needed it now that he had the trust. When Aaron died, his daughters discovered that his estate consisted of real property worth $1 million, titled solely in his own name under a deed he had recorded in 2001. Applying majority rules, address all arguments that Aaron's daughters and OCU can make, and discuss the legal effect of each of the three documents at his death. Evaluate who is likely to receive how much of Aaron's property and why.

In 2007, he swam across the North Pole in water that was so cold his fingers were frozen. Why did Pugh do this? Well, he wants people to pay attention to global warming and the problems it is causing. He decided to swim in water near the North Pole to bring attention to the melting glaciers. Lewis said that the swim was so scary and painful that it was his last time swimming in freezing water. But when he heard about Lake Imja, near Mount Everest, high in the Himalayas, he decided to swim in cold water again.Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world and swimming there is very difficult. It's so high that it's hard to breathe. You feel sick and your head hurts. The first time Lewis tried to swim across Lake Imja, he failed. He usually swims quickly because he wants to get out of the cold water. The first time at Lake Imja, he swam too fast and couldn't breathe. He tried one more time and swam more slowly. This time he was able to do it.global warming  a rise in the earth's temperature causing climate to changemelting  becoming water because of heat glaciers  a huge area of moving ice       How was Lewis able to swim across Lake Imja?

As you know, two of the vaccines currently been administered in the US are Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. There are many other vaccines being developed (and we need a good number of them to work if we want to end this pandemic. Because, we are beginning to turn the corner but not quite yet). The technology that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use is a novel one for vaccines: they use mRNA. Sounds familiar? One of the drawbacks of the Pfizer vaccine (not so much of the Moderna one because of the compounds they use) is that it has to be kept at ultra-freezing temperatures (-80degC). Why is that?

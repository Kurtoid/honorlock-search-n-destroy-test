For the following question, use this paragraph:1Two types of treatment are available to help people with panic disorders. 2Cognitive psychotherapy involves sessions in which patients reveal their feelings and fears to a psychiatrist. 3The psychiatrist then helps patients see how their thinking patterns can be self-defeating and illogical. 4Monitored drug treatment involves daily doses of an antidepressant medication along with therapy. 5This can help patients to conquer their panic and eventually discontinue taking the drug.--Adapted from Ciccarelli and White, Psychology, 2nd ed., p. 596.What is the topic of the paragraph?

Enzymes can be used in biomedical engineering research and therapeutic trails. To achieve the highest quality in enzymes production, it is important to purify them from impurities (I). In the following diagram a three-step purification process is illustrated. The mass flow rate of PEG (P) in stream "G" is 10 g/h. In stream "E", enzymes have the mass flow rate of 25 g/h and impurities have the mass flow rate of 30 g/h. We know, 5/6th of PEG (P) that enters the "Separator 2" in stream "E" leaves in stream "F". Also, we know the mass ratio of Enzymes to PEG in stream "G" is 20 times higher than it is in "F". Please answer the following questions:  Perform a DOF analysis on "Separator 1" (DOF analysis on other subunits is optional.). Write all the mass balance equations that can be written around "Separator 2", including the total mass balance equation. What is the mass flow rate of Enzymes in stream "F"? Show all your work.

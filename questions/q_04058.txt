The sugar molecule D-glucose can exist in an open-chain and a ring form (referred to as D-glucopyranose, shown below). When the open chain form of D-glucose is converted to the ring form, a new chiral center (referred to as the anomeric carbon) is formed. This produces two stereoisomers: the a-anomer and the b-anomer of D-glucopyranose (shown below).  In the LEAST stable chair form of D-glucopyranose, would the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) group be axial or equatorial? You can disregard the anomeric OH group to answer this question. [axeq] Which of the two anomers of D-glucopyranose is MORE stable? Note that the more stable anomer can assume the more stable chair conformation. [stableanomer] Which of the following options best describes the isomeric relationship between the two anomers of D-glucopyranose? [relationship]

Decalin (shown below) is a bicyclic organic molecule used as a solvent for many resins or fuel additives. There are two isomers of decalin, namely trans-decalin and cis-decalin (shown below). Answer the following questions about decalin.  Which of the two isomers of decalin would you expect to be LESS stable? [stable] One of the two decalin isomers CANNOT undergo a chair flip. Which one? [flip]

10. The transaction set forth in the PSA in the Supplemental Materials closes without incident. The Closing Date of the PSA was May 1, 2018, the Effective Date is January 1, 2018. One of the wells acquired is the Jones 1 well. Assume the Jones 1 well is listed on Exhibit B-1. The last date of production on the Jones 1 well is back in December 2016. The well produced from January 2014 until December 2016 and is not capable of producing, it needs to be plugged. There are other wells producing in the same unit; therefore, the leases assigned to Buyer under the PSA are held by production and in full force and effect. Less than 180 days after Closing, a working interest owner in the Jones 1 well sends a demand letter to Buyer demanding that Buyer pay such party a cash payment of $500,000.00 to satisfy such party's underproduced volumes in the Jones 1 well, as of the time it stopped producing. The Jones 1 well imbalance is not disclosed on Schedule 5.13. The demand letter also asserts and present proof that the Seller, as operator, failed to pay the party, making the claim $2,000,000.00 in production sales proceeds during the life of the well and demands that the Buyer pay the unpaid proceeds.In addition, 12 months after Closing a seep of black oily water is discovered on one of the acquired well locations percolating from the subsurface. Upon investigation, Buyer learns that the source of the seep is the result of ruptured casing in the related well. The ruptured casing was in that condition at the time of Closing. The investigation determines that the fresh water aquifer underlying the location is now polluted. The cost to clean the aquifer and repair the well is $10,000,000.00. The condition of the wellbore is not disclosed on Schedule 5.12 or 5.20. Neither the seep nor the condition of the aquifer is listed on Schedule 5.9. Assume the Seller (i.e., the identified officers in Section 15.10) had knowledge of the condition of the well prior to Closing but still did not disclose it.Please analyze the issues from both the Buyer's and Seller's perspective. What arguments would Buyer make to avoid or limit liability on each issue: cash balancing, the unpaid proceeds and the pollution liability.What arguments would Seller make to avoid or limit liability on each of the issues?Would your answers be different (on the first two issues) if the claims were asserted 24 months after Closing? Why? (20 points)

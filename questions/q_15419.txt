A CUDA kernel processes an mxn image where m is the vertical or y direction and n is the x or horizontal direction.  Suppose that m=600 and n=800 and we decide to use a grid of 16x16 thread blocks for the calculation with one thread per pixel.  How many warps will experience control divergence?  __global__ void PictureKernel(float* d_Pin, float* d_Pout, int n, int m) {    // Calculate the row # of the d_Pin and d_Pout element to process    int Row = blockIdx.y*blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;    // Calculate the column # of the d_Pin and d_Pout element to process    int Col = blockIdx.x*blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;    // each thread computes one element of d_Pout if in range    if ((Row < m) && (Col < n)) {        d_Pout[Row*n+Col] = 2*d_Pin[Row*n+Col];    }}

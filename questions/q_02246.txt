The pedigree illustrates a family affected with hereditary breast cancer.  Genetic testing has revealed a pathogenic variant in the BRCA2 gene:  6503delTT.  The Kaplan-Meier survival curve on the bottom left, illustrates the lifetime survival (1 - penetrance) of a BRCA2 pathogenic variant carrier.  At 30 years of age, the penetrance of this variant is 0% (all carriers are still alive), and by age 50, the penetrance increases to 60% and 77% respectively.  Which of the following options is the best estimate of the risk that IV-1 will have died  (ie. is penetrant) by the age of 50?

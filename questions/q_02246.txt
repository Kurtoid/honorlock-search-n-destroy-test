Students will complete at least 1 chapter every week. Some weeks, we will cover 2.
Bonus Question (5 points): What is the difference between an epitope and an antigen? Be brief.
Refer to the following scenario to answer the next three (3) questions. Dr. Edwards studies presidential approval, and uses the following item to measure it:   Do you approve of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president?    Disapprove a great deal Disapprove a moderate amount Disapprove a little Neither approve nor disapprove Approve a little Approve a moderate amount Approve a great deal   1 2 3 4 5 6 7      Because he is interested in understanding how presidential approval varies across different groups, he calculates the mean presidential approval score for people living in urban areas and compares it to the score for people living in rural areas.

What is the best method for carrying out the following reaction?
The nurse is developing a plan of care for a hospitalized school-age child with a visual impairment.  To decrease stress for the child, which of these measures should receive priority in the care plan?

The main mechanism of control of the rate of respiration is:
Opportunistic pathogens do not require underlying host factors to cause illness.
The name of the test to measure thoracic spine motion using linear measurement is known as:
You discover a novel microorganism and are excited to characterize it. Through several experiments, you discover that the microorganism possesses the following structures:  Lipopolysaccharide Peptidoglycan Type IV pilus Capsule  You conduct more experiments and discover the following characteristics:  Undergoes division in multiple planes Forms cell-to-cell contacts. After approximately 30 minutes, the cells whom it contacted are then able to form cell-to-cell contacts with other cells; you suspect DNA is transmitted during these contacts Possesses a non-chromosomal gene that inactivates silver heavy metals The organism was only isolated from water samples 3 ft below the surface of a fresh water lake (not any higher or any lower)  Based on the information above, answer the following questions (assume that if a structure is not listed then the bacteria does not possess it): 1. Is the organism Gram-positive or Gram-negative? [gram] 2. What would be its most likely morphology? [shape] 3. Is it motile or non-motile? [motile] 4. List one structure that could be considered a virulence factor. [factor] 5. Does it possess a plasmid? Yes or No. [plasmid] 6. If it does possess a plasmid, identify one category of plasmid could this fall under. (If no plasmid, type N/A) [category] 7. Identify one type of horizontal gene transfer this organism could undergo [HGT] 8. What cellular structure allows the organism to remain strictly 3 ft below the surface of the lake? [structure]
Microscopes should only be held with one hand.
________ formation begins when a river has filled its mouth with sediment
_______ is a system of symbols used by people to communicate.
(20 points) Aggregate demand and supply in U.S. history. In the following four questions, use the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model to describe the economic effects of each event/scenario described below. You will NOT draw a graph, but will explain what happens in words.  (hint: you can use your scratch paper to draw the graphs if that helps with your explanation.)   Explain briefly the following:  What caused the change? (what non-price determinant of demand or supply changed? For example, income increased, costs of production decreased, etc.) What happened to AD or AS? (increase, decrease, or unchanged).   (Hint: to simplify your analysis, assume only one curve is shifting (either Aggregate Demand or Aggregate Supply only.)   What was the effect on Real GDP and the Price-level (increase, decrease, or unchanged)

For a 9% coupon bond with a yield to maturity of 7%, matures in 3 years, a par value of $1000, calculate Macaulay duration, modified duration, and convexity for this bond.  Assume annual compounding and annual coupon payments. Estimate the price change of the bond if the yield to maturity decreases from 7% to 5.5% using modified duration and convexity.  Calculate the actual percentage change in the bond price if the yield to maturity decreases from 7% to 5.5%.  Perform these calculations in Excel and upload your completed excel spreadsheet.

A steam engine runs on the Rankine cycle. The steam leaves the boiler at 16 bar and 300 oC. The turbine has an efficiency of 85% and an outlet pressure of 0.5 bar. Pressure changes in the boiler and condenser can be considered negligible and the liquid leaving the condenser is saturated. What is the efficiency of this Rankine cycle?

Long Island Sound is a body of water off the northeast coast of the United States. Over nine million people live in the small watershed area that feeds into the sound. To determine the effect of the population density on the watershed, scientists measured the oxygen content of bottom waters in the sound. The data from late summer 2013 are displayed in the map below.  Based on the image, which of the following conclusions can best be drawn to describe the conditions in the Long Island Sound?

The Orphan Hermit flew (wearing a mask!) to Beijing, China, a few weeks ago to visit one of his old CHM 2051 classmates, who had returned to China to serve as CEO of a new startup company building innovative cell phones.  Although Orphy didn't encounter many other hermits in Beijing, he did run into a few hermits hiking along the Great Wall. Orphy flew to Beijing in one of United Airlines' new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which use the highly efficient GEnx jet engine.  He talked to the pilot, who pointed out that a jet engine is a form of heat engine, just as is a power plant, but far more efficient.  Not only are the jet turbine materials designed to tolerate higher temperatures (~1300oC), the temperature at flight altitudes is much lower (-50oC) than the ambient temperature on the ground.  Indeed, jet engine efficiency is highest at the altitude of the tropopause, the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere, typically 15km (50,000 ft).    Orphy wondered why atmospheric temperature is lowest at this point.  Briefly, tell Orphy why the temperature of the atmosphere increases as you go further up into the stratosphere.

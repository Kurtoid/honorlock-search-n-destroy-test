Solve the problem.A study was designed to investigate the effects of two variables -- (1) a student's level of mathematical anxiety and (2) teaching method -- on a student's achievement in a mathematics course. Students who had a low level of mathematical anxiety were taught using the traditional expository method. These students obtained a mean score of 290 with a standard deviation of 50 on a standardized test. Assuming a mound-shaped and symmetric distribution, in what range would approximately 99.7% of the students score?

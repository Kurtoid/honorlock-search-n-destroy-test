The magnetic structure shown below is made of soft cast steel. Assume that the core has an infinite relative permeability. The following parameters are known: N1 = 140 turns, N2 = 260 turns, R1 = 2.2E6 H-1, R2 = 5.7E6 H-1, and R3 = 3.8E6 H-1.   Find energy stored in the magnetic system if the current in the coil is 10 A dc and the current in coil 2 is zero. Now suppose that the coil 1 has a 60 Hz sinusoidal voltage across it with an rms value of 100 V.  Coil 2 is again left open circuited.  Find the voltage across coil 2.

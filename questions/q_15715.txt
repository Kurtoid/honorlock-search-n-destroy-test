Imagine researchers place a mouse and a plant inside a clear glass container, add a feeder bottle containing water, and add a container of grain that contains radiolabeled carbon (i.e., the sugars in the grain contain 14C instead of the regular 12C so that they can be tracked). They then water the plant with water containing the heavier isotope 18O instead of the regular 16O. They seal the container so that there are no inputs or outputs other than light. They then leave the system sealed for a week, during which time the mouse consumes grain and water from the water bottle, and the plant uses water from the soil containing the 18O. 1. Following consumption by the mouse, where would the 14C go? 2. Following uptake by the plant, where would the 18O go? Please explain both parts fully and clearly.

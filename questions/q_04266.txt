A population of four o'clocks is being studied to see if it is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  Recall that in four o'clocks flower color is determined as follows:RR = redRr = pinkrr = white Let:p = frequency of R alleleq = frequency of r allele You count 100 plants total: 36 plants with red flowers, 48 plants with pink flowers, and 16 plants with white flowers. You come back the next year to look at the flowers from the next generation of plants.  You find 200 plants.  If this population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, how many plants with white flowers would you expect to find?

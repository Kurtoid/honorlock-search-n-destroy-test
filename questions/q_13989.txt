Contrary to popular belief, Thomas  Edison was not born into poverty in a backwater mid-western frontier town. Actually he was born to middle-class parents in the lively port of Milan, Ohio, a community that next to Odessa, Russia, was the largest wheat shipping center in the world. In 1854, when little Edison was 7 years old, his family moved to Port Huron Michigan.During childhood learned eagerly by asking questions and reading numerous books. Unable to adapt himself to the routine of school, he quit three months after beginning when his teacher called him "addled".

To avoid  wasting time he moved  his basement laboratory to the baggage car and read in the public library during layovers in DetroitEdison filed papers with various inventions, from an electric vote recorder to a diplex and quadruplex telegraph.

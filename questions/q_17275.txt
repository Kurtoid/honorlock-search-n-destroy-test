Originally, this island was the top of a small mountain; however, all but the tip of this mountain was covered with water when people built the canal. Biologists have identified more than 300 species of plants that remain on this island, many of which only exist in Panama. Although tropical regions are warming the slowest of all places on Earth, scientists are concerned about the future of biodiversity in places such as Barro Colorado Island. By contrast, Dr. Angilletta is the only scientist worrying about the plants that live in his home state of New Jersey (39.75deg N latitude).

A schematic of Gibbs free energy of mixing D G as a function of volume fraction of polymer B, phB for a polymer blend (i.e., a mixture of polymer A and polymer B) at four different temperatures is shown below. Assume polymer blend is fully phase-mixed when temperature T >= 440 K. (i) Sketch (a) the temperature T vs. volume fraction of polymer B (phB) phase diagram by identifying several T and phB from the D G ~ phB plot, and (b) spinodal curve for this polymer blend. Moreover, indicate the single-phase region, two-phase region, metastable region, and unstable region, respectively.                                                                                                                                 (6 pts)  Note: you do not need to sketch quantitatively, yet do show clearly in your sketch as to how the binodal and spinodal curves are constructed.  (ii) How will the phase diagram change in terms of the critical temperature TC , critical volume fraction phB, C, and the overall shape, when the molecular weight of polymer B increases? Justify your answer and sketch a new phase diagram.               (6 pts)

The Red Imported Fire Ant (aka RIFA, aka Solenopsis invicta) was brought to Florida by humans from South America and its presence has had many well-documented negative effects on Florida native species. For example,  S. invicta are known to swarm and kill juvenile Florida Gopher Tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus). For this reason, we characterize S. invicta as a/an (?) species.

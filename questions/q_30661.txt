M2 cells naturally lack filamin, and A7 cells naturally overexpress filamin.  In the upper panel, both cell lines were uninfected (mock) or infected with wild-type V. vulnificus.  The extent of PAK1 activation was then monitored.  In the lower panel, M2 and A7 cells were transfected with GFP (pEGFP) or a domain of RtxA1 fused to GFP (pEGFP::rtxA11491-1971).  PAK1 activation was then monitored in the transfected cells. (i) How was activation of the PAK1 kinase detected? (ii) Why were uninfected cells (mock) used in the upper panel? (iii) Why were cells transfected with GFP alone used in the lower panel? (iv) Why were transfected cells used in addition to the infected cells? (v) Briefly interpret the collective results.

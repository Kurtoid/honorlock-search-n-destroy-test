The following image shows an incident light beam in material 1 striking an interface with material 2. At this interface the light splits, with some (labeled "A") staying in material 1 and some ("B") entering material 2 at a sharper angle. After light B passes through material 2, it strikes another interface where it enters material 3 (as shown by "C") with a very shallow angle.   List all of the beams (incident, A, B, & C) in order according to the wavelength of the light in the beam. List them in order from longest wavelength to shortest wavelength, being sure to note which if any have the same wavelength.

In this course we covered multiple ways of representing Simple Graphs. A simple graph does not have a self loop or a parallel edge. One example of a graph that is not simple is:  Two of the methods we covered for representing simple graphs were Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix. Pick one of these ways of representation and extend the representation to support a graph that is weighted and has parallel edges and self-loops. 1. Describe a data structure you will use to store such a graph in C++. [2.5 points] 2. Write the following methods in C++ that performs the respective functions on the data structure you described in (1) [7.5 points].   void insertEdge (int from, int to, int weight) - inserts an edge in your data structure  bool isEdge(int from, int to, int weight) - checks if an edge exists in your data structure with a given weight vector getWeights(int from, int to); - returns a vector of all weights that correspond to the edges between from and to vertices.

Read this text and answer questions 1-4. Norway is known as a democratic country. Its parliament is elected every four years and has 169 members. All citizens over 18 are automatically registered to vote. Voting is not compulsory, but nearly 80% of the electorate usually vote. In the UK, this figure is less than 70%, and in the USA, it is often below 60% of the electorate vote.   In Norway, there are several political parties who compete for people's votes. However, the parties are not focused on getting power for themselves, but instead work together to create policies that help the Norwegian people. This collaboration gives the people more power in the running of their country.   The population of Norway is almost 5.5 million, compared with almost 68 million in the UK. It is a rich country because it uses the profits from its offshore oil to help the country's finances. There is more financial equality in Norway than in most other countries due to a strong welfare state, higher taxes and entrepreneurship.   Norwegians feel a part of democracy because their voices are heard. They think of politicians as ordinary people who earn fair salaries and care about what happens to the country.

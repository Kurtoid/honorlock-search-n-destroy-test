10d) Write a G-CPU assembly language program to place the number $37 in the following locations:  $_000, $_300, $_700, $_A00, where _ is 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., E, and F (as shown to the right).  If desirable, you may use the new instructions created in parts a-c, e.g., LDAA dddd,X and STAB  dddd,X.  Assume the new instruction SUM_YX is also available. (This instruction is very much like the SUM_BA instruction).  The SUM_YX adds the value in Y to the value in X and stores the result in X.  The G-CPU RAM size must change for this problem.  Assume that the RAM is a 60k-byte module (from $1000-$FFFF) and that it is correctly enabled.  Use assembler directives and labels when appropriate.  Design your program using assembler directives so that it would be very easy for me to change the stored number from $37 to any other 8-bit number.  No "..." are allowed in this problem, i.e., write an efficient program!  Make sure you place your program in the appropriate memory locations.  (No machine codes are required.)

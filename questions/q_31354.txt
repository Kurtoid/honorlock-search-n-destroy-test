The data from a random sample of 100 students was used to fit a least squares regression line relating test scores to the number of hours spent playing Borderlands 3 each week. The explanatory variable (hours spent playing Borderlands 3) had a range of 0 - 18 and the response variable (test score) ranged from 39 - 99%. The resulting prediction equation is y = 39 + 3.3x. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient is 0.65. Determine if the following statements are TRUE or FALSE. a. The association between hours playing Borderlands 3 and test score is strong. [association] b. The regression equation predicts that as hours spent playing Borderlands 3 decreases, test score decreases. [relationship]

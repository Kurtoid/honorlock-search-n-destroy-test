You are required to show your reasoning on your paper. You must prove that you are not guessing.  Reasoning might include expressions and equations, drawings, models, pictures, or written explanations, but not necessarily all of these. TRUE OR FALSE: I know that my scratch paper will be submitted when my exam is over and that I may not get credit for any unsupported answers even if the answer is correct.
For the function f(x)=x2-12x+36{"version":"1.1","math":"f(x)=x2-12x+36"} , use the Second Derivative Test (and no other method) to determine if the function has a relative maximum or relative minimum at its critical number, x = 6.    Since the way you work the problem is the MOST important thing for this problem, you must make sure to upload your work for this problem to the Dropbox folder "Work for Test #3".   Answer:  The function has  _______________________   at its critical number x = 6. Write "a relative maximum" or "a relative minimum"; if the Second Derivative Test is inconclusive, instead write "inconclusive" (even though that doesn't work the way the sentence is structured).

In comparison to her fellow employees, Mary's employer subjects Mary to more severe disciplinary action for the same act of misconduct because she is a member of a protected group. Thus, Mary is a victim of disparate impact discrimination.
Write the answer to the following questions in the space provided: 31 (a) The rate constant (k) for a reaction was measured as a function of temperature. A plot of lnk versus 1/T(in Kelvin) is linear and has a slope of  -3697 K. Calculate the activation energy, Ea for the reaction. (use the relationship: slope = - Ea/R)                                                              [2 points]                                                                                                                                        31(b) The diagram shows the energy of a reaction as the reaction progresses. Label the diagram with the following                   [2 points]    a) activation energy (Ea) b) endothermic process c) reactants d) enthalpy of reaction ([?]H) e) products f) energy of dissociation g) activated complex   31 (c) According to the diagram the activation energy of the forward reaction is greater / less than the freverse reaction.

As of December 31, 2018, Bill Co. reported accounts receivable of $200,000 and an allowance for uncollectible accounts of $6,400. During 2019, accounts receivable increased by $20,000 (that change includes $5,000 of bad debts that were written off). An analysis of Bill Co.'s December 31, 2019, accounts receivable suggests that the allowance for uncollectible accounts should be 4% of accounts receivable. Bad debt expense for 2019 would be:A. $6,900.B. $7,400.C. $8,800.D. None of these answer choices are correct

A 15-year-old boy is referred to the neurogenetics clinic for myoclonic epilepsy. Before the onset of seizures, he had been well and developing normally. His maternal uncle died of an undiagnosed myopathic disorder at 53 years, his maternal aunt presented with progressive dementia and ataxia at 37 years, and his 80-year-old maternal grandmother had deafness, diabetes, and renal dysfunction. On examination, the patient had generalized muscle wasting and weakness, myoclonus, and ataxia. Results of a subsequent muscle biopsy reveal muscle fibers deficient for cytochrome oxidase staining and ragged-red fibers. Which of the following genes is most likely to be harboring the pathogenic variant in this family?     A APOB   B HEXA   C MT-TK   D ND1   E UBE3A

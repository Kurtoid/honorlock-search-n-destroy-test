Under normal conditions as the reaction occurs the concentration of Substance A decreases and the concentration of Substance C increases. The scientist tests the reaction by artificially increasing the initial concentration of each substance in separate trials. The results show that when Substance A is added that Substance C has a higher final concentration than normal. When Substance B is added the reaction proceeds at a higher rate. When Substance C is added, all other substances are react like normal.

If a "people seed" lands on your carpet, it will implant itself and eventually grow into a human. If you want to avoid these "people seeds", you can install various kinds of protections around your house (e.g. mesh screens on the windows). However, none of these various protections can 100% guarantee that no "people seed" will ever somehow find a way in and plant itself.

Testing based on Functional Equivalence Partitioning - Park Entry Fee (ticket price) On weekday, the park's ticket price is shown below: Price:   0                      for    Age: 0-2Price: 15                      for    Age: 3-54Price:   5                      for    Age: >=55 On Saturday and Sunday, the ticket price is doubled. A function, tPrice takes in two parameters: (age, dayOfWeek)  age: an Integer dayOfWeek: an Integer, 0 - 6 indicates Sunday to Saturday, other values are not allowed The function returns the ticket price. Use functional equivalence partitioning approach to design test cases for this function. You should have at least three levels of partition (not counting the root). You must show your partitioning tree.  Generate one test case for each leaf node. Note each test case should look like:  ((age, dayOfWeek), ticket_price) For example: ((10, 1), 15) ((60, 0), 10) ((-1, 0), Exception)

Read the following scenario and answer the question below. Mercury is a heavy metal that occurs naturally in minerals and rocks. Release of mercury from natural sources has been relatively constant over time. However, anthropogenic release of mercury has increased significantly in recent years primarily due to increased fossil fuel mining and combustion. Mercury that is released into the air eventually ends up in soils or surface water. Once in water, microbes convert mercury into methyl mercury, which is absorbed quickly and concentrated in the tissues of predatory fish such as shark and swordfish. Large fish typically concentrate more mercury than small fish. People who eat fish with high methyl mercury concentrations can show tremors, deafness, muscle dysfunction, and attention deficits. Pregnant women and children are especially sensitive to methyl mercury's toxic effects. Learning disabilities and developmental delays are common in children who have been exposed to significant levels of methyl mercury.   Mercury is not readily excreted. Instead, it is stored and concentrated in mammalian body tissues through a process called ________.
Identify each type of reaction as combination, decomposition, or combustion.   P4O10 + 6H2O --> 4H3PO4  [cat5]   CaCO3 --> CO2 + CaO   [cat6]   CH4 + O2 --> CH2  + H2O  [cat7]   H2SO3 --> H2O + SO2  [cat8]

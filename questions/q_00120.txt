Identify the type of bone labelled '3'.
Complete the main method below so that it reads in a file named FileIn.txt (assume this exists in the same directory where you are running your program). The method should output each line to another file named FileOut.txt, replacing each EVEN line with "This is line X", where X is the line number (starting with 1).  Look closely at the example output for more clarification. Notice that the output file has the SAME number of lines as the input file. HINT: Store each line from the input file into a String variable BEFORE testing if it is an even or odd line number. import java.io.*;import java.util.Scanner;public class FileIO {  public static void main(String[] args) { /* Your implementation here */ }} Example input and output files:     FileIn.txt   FileOut.txt     Hello world and hello once again    Hello This is line 2 and hello This is line 4        Make sure to select the 'Preformatted' style from the dropdown so your code is formatted clearly.  DO NOT USE THE TAB KEY WHEN WRITING CODE AS YOU MAY ACCIDENTALLY SUBMIT YOUR EXAM. USE THE SPACE BAR INSTEAD.

You discover a novel microorganism and are excited to characterize it. Through several experiments, you discover that the microorganism possesses the following structures:  Lipopolysaccharide Peptidoglycan Type IV pilus Capsule  You conduct more experiments and discover the following characteristics:  Undergoes division in multiple planes Forms cell-to-cell contacts. After approximately 30 minutes, the cells whom it contacted are then able to form cell-to-cell contacts with other cells; you suspect DNA is transmitted during these contacts Possesses a non-chromosomal gene that inactivates silver heavy metals The organism was only isolated from water samples 3 ft below the surface of a fresh water lake (not any higher or any lower)  Based on the information above, answer the following questions (assume that if a structure is not listed then the bacteria does not possess it): 1. Is the organism Gram-positive or Gram-negative? [gram] 2. What would be its most likely morphology? [shape] 3. Is it motile or non-motile? [motile] 4. List one structure that could be considered a virulence factor. [factor] 5. Does it possess a plasmid? Yes or No. [plasmid] 6. If it does possess a plasmid, identify one category of plasmid could this fall under. (If no plasmid, type N/A) [category] 7. Identify one type of horizontal gene transfer this organism could undergo [HGT] 8. What cellular structure allows the organism to remain strictly 3 ft below the surface of the lake? [structure]

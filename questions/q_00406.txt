Read the following scenario to answer the following question(s).Biomedical scientists have recently developed an anticancer drug delivery system that sneaks the anticancer drug into cancer cells before releasing it. They were able to do this by using two sets of liposomes. An anticancer drug (Doxorubicin (Dox)) bound to DNA molecules was added into one set of liposomes, and a high concentration of ATP molecules were added to the other set of liposomes. The drug is inactive when bound to DNA molecules. Researchers inject both types of liposomes into cancer cells, and upon doing so their contents are released. The ATP molecules from one set of liposomes bind to the DNA molecules from the other set of liposomes) and activate the drug, thus inducing cell death and decreasing tumor size.Mice with breast cancer tumors were treated with this liposome system to test the effectiveness of the drug. The scientists performed three trials-one with both types of liposomes (Dox + ATP), one with just the drug (Dox only), and one with a salt solution (control). Examine the figure below and answer the following questions.A student in your class examines the graph and hypothesizes that ATP is what kills cancer cells, and not Dox. What follow-up experiment would allow you to test this student's hypothesis?

11. A kitchen design firm builds cabinets on a make-to-order basis for new-home construction. Both holding inventory and backorders are allowed. In June 2018, there is currently a backorder of 100 cabinets. The demand for July through December of 2018 is shown in the table below. The regular-time production cost is $590 per cabinet, the overtime production cost is $885 per cabinet, the cost of holding a cabinet in inventory is $84 per cabinet, and the cost of backordering a cabinet is $95 per cabinet. The number of cabinets in inventory may never decrease by more than 10% from one month to the next, and the number of cabinets in inventory at the end of December must be 0. The number of backordered cabinets may never increase by more than 10% from one month to the next, and the number of backordered cabinets at the end of December must be 0. Regular-time production must be the same in each of the six months of the planning horizon and overtime production in a given month is limited to no more than 40% of the regular time production level. Build a linear programming model for the aggregate plan that will minimize the sum of backorder costs + inventory costs + regular-time production costs + overtime production costs for the six-month planning period.    Month July August September October November December   Demand 400 700 1000 600 400 300

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing]. The following table is a randomized sample (N=25) records from this dataset.  For this question, let's assume that the classification goal  is to predict if the client will open an account. The dependent variable, in this case, is denoted by variable y, which identifies that the client opened/did not open an account.

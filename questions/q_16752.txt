Euparkeria is a rare disease. The symptoms are not clear at first, but grow worse as time progresses. There is a test which detects Euparkeria early, and allows treatment to start before the symptoms become serious. Note that the symbol 'Pos' indicates a positive result on the test. The symbol E indicates that the patient has Euparkeria. The symbol indicates that the patient does not have Euparkeria. Note: Ec is "E complement"               Pr (Pos| E) = .920                      Pr (E) = .0456                What is Pr (E | Pos)?               Pr (Pos| Ec) = .028                  Note: Pr (E) + Pr (Ec) =1

After a college football team once again lost a game to their archrival, the alumni association conducted a survey to see if alumni were in favor of firing the coach. A simple random sample of 100 alumni from the population of all living alumni was taken. Sixty-four of the alumni in the sample were in favor of firing the coach. Let p represent the proportion of all living alumni who favored firing the coach.  Suppose the alumni association wished to see if the majority of alumni are in favor of firing the coach. To do this they test the hypotheses H0: p = 0.50 versus Ha: p > 0.50. What is the P-value for this hypothesis test?

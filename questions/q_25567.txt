Women--of all ages--particularly suffer when telecommuting, Berg told me, with fewer promotions and slower wage growth. Employers already tend to assume that women, and especially mothers, are less dedicated to work than their male counterparts are, no matter how hard they toil. If those same women seek permission to stay home for good--opting out of the "face time" that many of their bosses hold irrationally dear--it could encourage the assumption that they're sitting on their couches eating SkinnyPop and watching HGTV.    Good employers can account for those biases in their work practices, and theoretically, workers can organize their colleagues to pressure management toward better accommodations, such as expansion of parental leave and greater transparency in pay. But those efforts, including forming a union, are much harder when people can't meet face-to-face.

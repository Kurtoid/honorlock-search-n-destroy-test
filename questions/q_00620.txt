Q2: 10 points The greatest common divisor of two integers (GCD) is the largest integer that will divide exactly into both numbers. For example, the GCD of 12 and 30 is 6. The flowchart shown below describes an algorithm to find the GCD of two integers (81 and 144 in this case). Write a Python code that implements the steps shown in the flowchart.        Add code that will print p and q after exactly 3 iterations. There should be only a single print statement in addition to the final result for the GCD. Upload your completed .py file here.

You have isolated a DNA sample from bacteria taken from mummified tissues and you hope to characterize its metabolic characteristics. You determine the sequence of the microbe's DNA and find a gene for superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as the gene for catalase. Based on this analysis what are the possible oxygen requirement/s of this microbe (ie, obligate aerobe, obligate anaerobe, etc., please name all that apply)? Please provide support for your answers and include the role of these genes (6 points).

Write in the correct answer to best complete each sentence within the paragraph below. (1 point each)   Throughout the day blood glucose levels fluctuate within a normal range.  The body maintains this "normal" range by using a _________A___________ feedback loop to reverse the direction of change and make small adjustments.  For example, when blood glucose levels are high, the hormone ________B____________ is secreted from the pancreas gland.  This hormone stimulates the __________C__________ and __________D__________  to begin storing the excess blood glucose and for _________E___________ to metabolize the glucose for energy.  Working as an __________F__________  to the previous hormone is another hormone called _________G___________ which is secreted from the pancreas gland.  This hormone is released when blood glucose levels are low, so the glucose needs to be released from __________H__________ and put into the bloodstream.

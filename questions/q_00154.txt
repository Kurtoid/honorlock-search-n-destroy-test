Brianna and Jess must pay an income tax. Both Brianna and Jess pay $1,000 in taxes each year, but Brianna earns $20,000 and Jess earns $10,000. From this information, you can infer that this tax is:

2. A type of beetle is accidentally introduced into a forest. The population grows according to the model   where t is the number of weeks after the beetles were introduced. a. (1 pt) How many beetles are there at time t = 0? b. (1 pt) What is the continuous growth rate? c. (2 pts) How many beetles will there be after 5 weeks? Round to the nearest whole number. d. (3 pts) When will the population reach 1,500 beetles? Round to two places after the decimal. The model is f(t) = 75 * e^(0.23t)

A 65-kg body 1 stays at one end of a 8.2-m-long and 15 kg board. A 35 Kg body 2 stays at one sixth (L/6) from the other end. Where should the pivot be placed so that the board is balanced? (Consider the Center of Gravity of the bar in the middle.)    Hint: in this exercises there is three torques related with three force of gravity (two bodies and the board). The torque is the weight times the distance to the pivot. Place the pivot wherever you want and assign a distance x from the body 1 to the pivot. Then express the distance from the point of action of the other two forces of gravities (board and body 2) to the pivot, by means of x.

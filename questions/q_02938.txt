Some students have been told that people remember words that are written in green ink better than red ink. Therefore, I collected data from 2 sections of Psych 202. My 2:30 pm class had a list of words in green ink to memorize. My 4:00 pm class had a list of words in red ink to memorize. After a delay, student recalled as many words as they could. My 4:00 pm class with green ink (group 1) had a mean of 25.2 words, SS = 1030, n = 36. My 2:30 pm class with red ink (group 2) had a mean of 22.5 words, SS = 930, n = 36. Together their pooled variance is 28.

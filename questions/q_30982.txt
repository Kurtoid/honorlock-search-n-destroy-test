An implementation of RSA performs exponentiation by going through the exponent one bit at a time. For a bit in the exponent, it squares the result - this is done regardless of what the value of the exponent's bit is. Then, only if the exponent's bit is tested, the result is multiplied with the message (in this code, exp, res, and msg are large numbers, and each of them occupies thousands of bytes in memory): // For each bit in the exponentfor(int bit_idx=nbits-1; bit_idx>=0; bit_idx--){   BN_sqr(res,res); // res=res*res;   // Get bit_idx'th bit from large number exp   bool bit= get_bit_at_index(exp,bit_idx);   if(bit)      BN_mul(res,res,msg); // res=res*msg} While Betty is using this RSA implementation to sign a message, Evan is running his attack application on the same server, so that Betty's RSA signing program and Evan's attack program share the cache. Before Evan can successfully perform a Prime+Probe attack and discover Betty's secret exponent, he needs to know (or find out) a few facts. You answer should have two paragraphs, one for part A and one for part B below.  Evan needs to know (or write test programs that measure) a few parameters of the cache on the server system. Name at least one property of the server's cache hardware that Evan really must know. Explain why Evan must know the value of that cache property. Evan needs to know something about the data use in the large-number exponentiation code use by Betty. Name at least one variable and at least one property of that variable that Evan must know. Explain why Evan must know that specific fact about that specific variable.

Action: Show the front and back of your blank work paper to the camera before starting the test. Remember: Show your work to the camera after you type your answers on Canvas. Answers must match those on your work pages for possible partial credit. Write ALL answers/solutions on your work pages (labeling the problem number as you go) and type in your results the best you can on Canvas (use short hand notation, try not to use the equation editor unless you like to). Thank you and good luck. You'll do great! Best, Dr. Cobb

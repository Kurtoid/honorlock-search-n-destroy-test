A force is applied at the free end of a cantilever steel beam. The moment of inertia (I), the section modulus (S), dimensions, and centroid are shown in the figure. Determine the Normal Bending Stress at point "c" of the section (A-A) at the neutral axis, in MPa
Problem 2. (10 points) A steel shaft having a solid circular cross section, A, is subjected to the tensile stress of 25/A kN/mm2 and the shear stress of 15/A kN/mm2.  When the yield strength of the shaft is 100 N/mm2 and the ultimate strength is 105 N/mm2, determine the cross section A of the shaft by using (a) Maximum Principal Stress theory, (b) Maximum Shear Stress theory, and (c) Distortion Energy theory. Also, make comments on the obtained diameters. (a) Write down the value of A from MPS. [answer_1] (b) Write down the value of A from MSS. [answer_2] (c) Write down the value of A from DE. [answer_3]

8) Cathy and Ed were driving home one day (Cathy driving; Ed in the passenger seat). Suddenly, they hit a patch of ice. Their car skidded several times before Cathy could get the car under control.  Cathy thought she had handled the ice really well and although it was a bit scary, they were never in any real danger (e.g., the car never even left their own lane).

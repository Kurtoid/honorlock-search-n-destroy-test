A centrifuge is used to train pilots to handle high g-forces. The pilot is located at point P and the centrifuge rotates about point O.  The training in the centrifuge begins at a constant angular speed. This constant angular speed produces a 1-g acceleration at point P (in the radial direction), where g is the standard value for acceleration due to gravity that we have been using all semester. Later in the training, the pilot is subjected to an acceleration of [maxaxx]-g.  The radius r is [rad] m and the rotation is in the +z-direction (coming out of the page/computer screen). Calculate the initial angular velocity required to produce the 1-g acceleration that was just described.

He took something out of his pocket and held it out. Mrs. White drew back with a grimace, but her son, taking it, looked at it curiously. "And what is there special about it?" inquired Mr. White as he took it from his son, and having examined it, placed it upon the table.                                                                                                         "It had a spell put on it by an old fakir," said the sergeant- major, "a very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it." The sergeant-major's manner was so impressive that the family members were conscious that their light laughter jarred  somewhat.                                                                                                        "Well, why don't you have three wishes, sir?" said Herbert White, cleverly. The soldier regarded him in the way that middle age often regards presumptuous youth. "I have," he said, quietly, and his blotchy face whitened. "And did you really have the three wishes granted?" asked Mrs. White. "I did," said the sergeant-major, and his glass tapped against his strong teeth.                                    "And has anybody else wished?" inquired the old lady. "The first man had his three wishes, yes," was the reply. "I don't know what the first two were, but the third was for death. That's how I got the paw." His tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group.                                                                 "If you've had your three wishes, it's no good to you now, then, Morris," said the old man at last. "What do you keep it for?" The soldier shook his head. "Just for amusement, I suppose," he said, slowly. "I did have some idea of selling it, but I don't think I will. It has caused enough trouble already. Besides, people won't buy it. Most of them think it's a fairy-tale, and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me       64    afterwards." "If you could have another three wishes," said the old man, watching him closely, "would you have them?" "I don't know," said the other. "I don't know."

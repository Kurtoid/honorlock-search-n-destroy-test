Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a large, highly integrated complex containing many copies of three distinct enzymes and several coenzymes involved in its catalytic activity. The coenzymes can be classified depending on how they participate in an enzymatic reaction. A coenzyme prosthetic group is tightly bound to the enzyme and remains bound during the catalytic cycle. The original coenzymes are regenerated during the catalytic cycle. On the other hand, a coenzyme cosubstrate is loosely bound to an enzyme and dissociates in an altered form as part of the catalytic cycle. Its original form is regenerated not by the cycle, but by another enzyme. Name the coenzymes of pyruvate dehydrogenase and note whether they are prosthetic groups or cosubstrates of PDH.
AS is a 54-year-old business man who has a family history of lung cancer. AS started smoking at 15; years later, he got what he thought was a very bad cold that lasted for a week, started experiencing pain in his tongue, and was given ibuprofen for pain. He then noticed white sores that were getting bigger in his oral cavity near the tongue. He started feeling generally lousy and was unable to eat because of severe pain; he lost 30 lbs in a month. AS went to the clinic, where they did a biopsy that revealed squamous cell cancer of the tongue. AS has undergone radiation therapy (RT) and surgery to remove the cancer and a restorative surgery was scheduled. Because of the RT, AS has developed mucositis and xerostomia in his oral cavity. All his nodes that were sent to the laboratory tested negative for metastasis, and no further RT was needed. The surgeons felt confident that they had removed all the cancer.   HT: 5'11" UBW: 165 lbs WT: 135 lbs   Meds: Corticosteroids and antineoplastic (dexamethasone) to reduce inflammation, K depletion, Na retention; and morphine for pain. To help combat the mucositis, what would the registered dietitian recommend?

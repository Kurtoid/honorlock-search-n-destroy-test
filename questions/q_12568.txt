First, design on scratch paper the logic circuit corresponding to the following logic expression: X = D OR A OR NOT(A AND NOT(B) AND C AND NOT(D) ) Do not simplify the expression and only use the following gates (with at most 2 inputs):  Now that you have implemented the logic circuit for the expression, examine the parts below showing the four inputs A - D to the expression, logic gates (some already connected) with their inputs I0 - I9 and outputs O0 - O4, and the output X of the expression:  Your task for this question is to wire up all of the parts above to implement the logic circuit for the expression guided by your design. Select from the dropdown boxes the appropriate wire connections, but be careful since order matters. For example, if the input for I0 , I1 , I2 is chosen to be A, O1, C then this ordering means that I0 is connected to A, I1 is connected to O1, and I2 is connected to C. What is the input for I0 , I1 , I2? [r1]What is the input for I3 , I4? [r2]What is the input for I5 , I6? [r3]What is the input for I7 , I8? [r4]What is the input for I9? [r5]What is connected to X? [r6]

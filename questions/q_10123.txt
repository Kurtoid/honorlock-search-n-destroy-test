Question 1 J. B. Jackson describes landscape as a 'field of perpetual conflict and compromise between what is established by authority and what the vernacular insists upon preferring.' Can landscape architects acknowledge and accommodate 'what the vernacular insists upon preferring,' or is our profession inherently authoritarian? Use specific examples.   Question 2 In "Waste Landscapes: Permissible Metaphors in Landscape Architecture," Mira Engler suggests that 'waste facilities should be brought out of the closet and that landscape design is an appropriate tool for exploring and proposing models that contribute to advertising waste problems.' Given our disdain for garbage, how can landscape design be used as a tool to advertise waste problems? Use specific examples.   Question 3 - (You may only chose this questions if you gave a presentation on either 'Waste Landscapes' or 'Vernacular Landscapes') Since the late 19th century onwards, small parks (pocket, linear and vertical) have been seen as a important landscape typology that complement its larger counterparts (large parks and other extensive landscapes). What challenges and what opportunities do these smaller spaces present for landscape architects? Use specific examples.

You run a business that will supply natural gas to customers in Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, and Pensacola from distribution centers (DCs). You have three candidate DC locations to choose from (Gainesville, Lake City, and Tallahassee). Each DC has a capacity restriction that limits the number of units of gas it can supply. Each customer city has a demand that should be satisfied. Develop a single integer linear programming formulation that (when solved) will determine which DC locations to open and allocate DC capacity to the customers so as to minimize total distribution costs plus the fixed cost of the facilities that are opened. The per unit cost of distributing one unit of natural gas from each DC to each customer is shown in the table below, along with the demand and capacity levels. The fixed costs of operating DC's (if opened) in Gainesville, Lake City, and Tallahassee are $3000, $4500, and $4000, respectively. [Do not solve the problem. Just provide the formulation without any attempt to reduce complexity by solving (or partially solving) the problem.].     Tampa Orlando Jacksonville Pensacola Capacity   Gainesville $1.40 $0.95 $1.55 $3.25 1200   Lake City $1.55 $1.40 $1.20 $2.80 1800   Tallahassee $1.90 $1.75 $1.80 $2.15 1600           Demand 800 700 500 600

A group of researchers found that people prefer training films of moderate length; shorter films contain too little information, while longer films are boring. For a training film on the care of exotic birds, the researchers determined that the ratings people gave for the film could be approximated by     R(t)=20tt2+100{"version":"1.1","math":"R(t)=20tt2+100"},   where t is the length of the film (in minutes), for t>=0{"version":"1.1","math":"t>=0"}. Find the film length that received the highest rating.

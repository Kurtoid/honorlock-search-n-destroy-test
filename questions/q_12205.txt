Many biochemical reactions are not spontaneous (that is, DGdeg >0), yet they are essential to life.  Consider for instance the synthesis of proteins from amino acids; forming a dipeptide from two amino acids has a DGdeg of ~ +30 kJ.  Briefly explain how living systems overcome these thermodynamic challenges.

A random sample of n1 = 100 students at a high school was asked whether they would ask their father or mother for help with a financial problem. A second sample of n2 = 100 different students was asked the same question regarding a dating problem. Forty-three students in the first sample (x1) and 47 students in the second sample (x2) replied that they turned to their mother rather than their father for help. Construct a 98% confidence interval for the difference in proportion, p1 - p2. Point Estimate = [pointestimate] Error = [error] Lower/Upper Limits = [limits] Remember that due to rounding differences between the calculator and table methods, the answers shown might not exactly match what you have calculated but should be very close. Choose the answer that most closely resembles your response.

Using the physiograph traces below, compare the electrocardiogram (EKG) records with that of the normal patient.   Make an educated decision as to the likelihood of the irregularity that you observe. NOTE: There may be more than one correct response, but you need to list only one selection to have a correct answer.  Do not use a response more than once across the block of three EKG questions.  If you list multiple answers and any one is incorrect, your whole response will be counted incorrect. Exam2_EKG1.tif

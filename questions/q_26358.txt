An ideal silicon PN junction is uniformly doped and has a band diagram is shown below.  Calculate the hole current density (JP) at a position where it is 2 times electron diffusion length (2LN) from the depletion edge of the p-type quasi-neutral region.  For simplicity, use the electron mobility = 1000 cm2/V-s, the hole mobility  = 450 cm2/V-s, and the minority carrier lifetime is 2x10-6 s (for both electrons and holes.) Your answer should be in the units of A/cm2.   Enter your final answer here:

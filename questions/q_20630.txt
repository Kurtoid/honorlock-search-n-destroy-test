This particular Alu element is dimorphic.  Lane 1 is the DNA molecular mass ruler, which contains 1000 bp, 700 bp, 500 bp, 200 bp, & 100 bp fragments.  Lanes 2-4 contain positive controls for different Alu element conditions at this locus.  The Alu sequence is 300 bp long and the two possible PCR products may be 641 bp long and 941 bp long. Which lane contains ONLY a 941 bp DNA fragment.

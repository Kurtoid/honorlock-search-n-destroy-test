A decorative plastic film on a copper sphere of 10 mm diameter in an oven at 750C. Upon removal from the oven, the sphere is subjected to an air stream at 1 atm. , and 230C having a velocity of 10 meter/sec. Estimate how long it will take to coal the sphere to 350C? Density of copper is 8933 kg/m3 , thermal conductivity k = 399 W/m.K and specific heat Cp = 387 J/kg.K. for Air at an average temperature of T[?]  = 296 K has  viscosity u= 181x10-7 N.s/m2 , kinematic viscosity n = 15.36x10-6 m2/s and thermal conductivity k = 0.0258 W/m.K and Prandtl  No. Pr = 0.709 and air at surface temperature Ts = 328 K will have viscosity us = 197x10-7 N.s/m2

The church agreed to pay the lawyer for work he did in which a bequest to the church was included in the will.  The church then sent out a notice to members stating that any member who wanted to leave money to the church could use the lawyer and the legal fees would be paid by the church.  Jane, a member of the church, contacted the lawyer about leaving a gift.  The lawyer asked Jane if she would consent to allow the church to pay her legal fees and he informed her that the church could not interfere in the representation.  Jane consented.  Jane proposed two possible gifts and the lawyer without Jane's permission asked a church leader which gift was preferable.  The lawyer completed the work competently for Jane in drafting the will.

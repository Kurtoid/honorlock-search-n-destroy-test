Two ants are at x=0. At t=0, one ant of mass [m1] mg starts to move along x axis at a constant speed [v1] m/s. At the same time, the other ant of mass [m2] mg leaves origin with zero initial speed and constant acceleration [a] m/s2 along x axis. How far (in cm) is the center of mass of the two ants away from the origin (x=0) after [t] s if they move in the same direction?

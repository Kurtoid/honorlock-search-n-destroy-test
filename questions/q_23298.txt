Given: typedef struct { int MM; int SS; } Time ; void main() { Time t[2] = {{7,45},{16,30}};   Which of the following statements will print the two item Time array as a start and end time: Start: 7:45 End: 16:30 Note: "%02i" is the printf format string that will zero pad an integer to fill two digits so it gives 04 in stead of 4 .   printf("Start: %2i:%02i End: %2i:%02i n", p[0].MM, p[0].SS, p[1].MM, p[1].SS );   printf("Start: %2i:%02i End: %2i:%02i n", p[0]->MM, p[0]->SS, p[1]->MM, p[1]->SS );   printf("Start: %2i:%02i End: %2i:%02i n", t0->MM, t0->SS, t1->MM, t1->SS );   printf("Start: %2i:%02i End: %2i:%02i n", t0.MM, t0.SS, t1.MM, t1.SS );

Why was it not entirely incorrect to call Epicureans Hedonists?
Recall that, for positive integer m and non-negative integer a, the remainder of a when divided by m is the unique integer r where 0 <= r < m and a=qm+r for some q [?] N. Consider the following algorithm for finding the remainder when a is divided by m. rem(a,m), where a [?] N and m [?] N+ if a < m return a else return rem(a-m,m){output is the remainder of a when divided by m} Which of the following steps are part of showing that rem terminates using strong induction on n and the predicate P(n), which is the statement "rem(n,m) terminates"? Select all that apply. (Note that m remains fixed throughout.)

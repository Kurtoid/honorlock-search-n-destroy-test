You are the network administrator for your network. Your network consists of a single Active Directory domain. Your company recently mandated the following user account criteria:   User accounts must be deactivated after three unsuccessful logon attempts. User account passwords must be at least 12 characters long. User accounts must be manually reset by an administrator once they are locked out.   You must make the changes to affect everyone in the domain. You are editing the Default Domain Group Policy object. What should you do? (Choose three. Each correct choice represents part of the solution.)
(a) 10 points In metal-based AM processes, what defects can arise in the components due to stresses during the build? What is residual stress, how does it arise and what post-build problems can it lead to? What steps can be taken to reduce residual stresses after the build?   (b) 10 points The component shown in Figure 1 has a number of features such as a protruding T-section which comes off at 50deg to the main component, and three holes of different radii, 3 mm (small), 5 mm (medium) and 12 mm (large). Considering the three build orientations shown in Figure 2 (A, B and C), which will have the lowest residual stress? Which will require the least support structures? Where are the support structures needed? Which would be the best choice of orientation for the build? Justify your answers, detailing specific design rules which should be considered for the features of the part.    Figure 1 Base Plate (left) Component (right)      Figure 2 Build orientations A (left), B (center) and C (Right)    (c) 10 points What causes surface roughness in AM parts? What levels of surface roughness (Ra) would you expect for the as-built component? Is this the same all over the component? Describe "stair-casing" and the relationship between surface orientation to the vertical build direction and surface roughness.

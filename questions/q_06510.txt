In the coal-gasification process, carbon monoxide is converted to carbon dioxide via the following reaction: CO (g) + H2O (g) =  CO2 (g) + H2 (g) In an experiment, 0.35 mol of CO and 0.40 mol of H2O were placed in a 1.00 L flask.  At equilibrium, there were 0.19 mol of CO remaining.  Determine the value of the equilibrium constant, Kc.

Solve the following excavation problem: A contractor is excavating the above trench.  He is supposed to dig the trench 5 ft wide. The soil was tested to have an approximate swell factor of 12% and a shrinkage factor of 10%.  The contractor is placing a footing in the trench and then backfilling with the soil that was removed.  Use the dimensions provided including workspace. Topsoil = 6".    Calculate the amount of earthwork for excavating the trench using Section A detail. (15 Points). If  the volume of the footing and the wall is 30 CY, Find the amount of backfill needed in loose and bank quantities (10 points)     Note:  Show all calculations neatly and fill the attached tables for quantity take offs for excavations, concrete and reinforcement.

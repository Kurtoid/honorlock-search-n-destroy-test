How hot could it be? Create a C function called calAverage(). Utilize any repetition statement within the function definition of calAverage() to calculate the average value of N elements in an integer array. The function calAverage() accepts three arguments but returns no value. Those three arguments of the function are:  an integer array that contains numbers to be averaged, an integer argument that indicates the number of elements in the integer array, a reference floating-point argument (pointer) for the average value.  Write a C program to read rows of data from the file: miamiweather.txt (download this file and add it to your repl) and store the data into one- or two-dimensional arrays depending on the type of the data. Each row of data contains name of the month, low temperature in Fahrenheit, high temperature in Fahrenheit and precipitation in inch. The program should display a table of data with a proper header. Then, the program has to automatically calculate the annual average low temperature and the annual average high temperature and display the average values with 2 decimal places. An example of output dialog is shown below: Miami Weather ForecastMonth        Low   High Precipitation January 61 77 0.54February 63 79 0.63March 66 81 0.71April 69 84 1.05May 73 87 2.19June 76 89 6.52July 77 91 4.62August 78 91 5.85September 77 89 6.17October 74 86 2.90November 69 82 1.15December 64 79 0.68Annual average low temperature is 70.58Annual average high temperature is 84.58 Hints:  Call the function calAverage() after file reading has completed. Call the function calAverage() twice: one for calculating average low temperature, and another one for calculating average high temperature. When dividing two integers, the result is integer.

Skill D5. Joe and Rose are engineers on a design team.  Each one has a subsystem to design, and each one also contributes to the system design.

Based on the incentives in place and estimates of how their effort affects the performance of the subsystems and the system, they formulate the following two-player, simultaneous, mixed-motive game.  In this table, each cell is (Rose's bonus, Joe's bonus).     (Subsystem effort)   Joe: low   Joe: medium   Joe: high     Rose: low   ($1,168, $1,669)   ($1,134, $1,738)   ($1,071, $1,681)     Rose: medium   ($1,309, $1,635)   ($1,246, $1,675)   ($1,133, $1,567)     Rose: high   ($1,342, $1,573)   ($1,229, $1,562)   ($1,022, $1,361)     Which of the following statements about this game is true?

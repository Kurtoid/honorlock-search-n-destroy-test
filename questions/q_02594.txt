Suppose that your fund manager claims that he/she can time the market, i.e., adjust the market exposure of his/her managed fund depending on the market's going up or going down. To test this fund manager's claim, you want to use the following quadratic functional form for the fund's time-varying exposure to market.                                     a) (5pts) Provide a regression model and associated hypothesis testing (or statistical inference) to test the claimed market-timing ability of the fund manager. Assume that you have the time-series of monthly returns of his/her managed fund and that the market factor is the only systematic component available. b) (5pts) Suppose that you have the data in the following table: Column C is the excess return of a hedge fund and Column D is the market excess return. For your answer in part a), provide Excel formula to implement the market-timing test. Feel free to define and add new columns if needed depending on your answer in part a). When defining a new column, clearly explain how it can be computed.

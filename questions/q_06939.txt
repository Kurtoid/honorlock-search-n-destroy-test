In Vivek Pai's paper on the Flash webserver, the authors evaluated several webserver designs using two traces - the Owlnet trace, whose dataset size was 100MB, and the CS trace, whose dataset size was 7.8GB. The webservers they compared include Flash (which followed the AMPED model), SPED (the Zeus single-process event-driven server), MT (a multi-threaded webserver), MP (a multi-process webserver, Apache (an unoptimized Apache webserver).  The tests were performed using a 333MHz PentiumII CPU with 128 MB of memory and multiple 100 Mbit/s Ethernet interfaces.  Give the correct answer to the following questions:1. In the event of the CS trace, which of the following will perform better:     a.    Flash vs. MT [a]     b.    Flash vs. MP [b]     c.    Flash vs. SPED [c]     d.    SPED vs. MT [d]     e.    MT vs. MP [e]2. In the event of the Owlnet trace, which of the following will perform better:     f.     Flash vs. MT [f]     g.    Flash vs. MP [g]     h.    SPED vs. MT [h]     i.     MT vs. MP [i]     j.     MP vs. Apache [j]3. Without modifying the implementation described in the paper, when running on a more recent quad-core platform with 12GB of memory, which one would you expect to perform better:     k.    Flash vs. MT [k]     l.   MT vs. MP [l]

War Eagle Products currently has a market value of debt of $1 million. They have 100,000 shares outstanding at a cost per share of $30. Currently their debt is rated A+ and is yielding 7% in the marketplace and they have a beta of 1.2. They are considering a change to their capital structure by issuing an additional $1 million in debt and buying back stock. This would cause their rating to drop to BB+ which currently yields 8% in the marketplace. Assume that the risk-free rate is 6%, the equity risk premium is 5%, and the effective tax rate is 40%. Based on this information, the current cost of equity would be [Coenow]% and the current cost of capital would be [WACCnow]%. The unlevered beta would be [unbeta] and the levered beta following the recapitalization would be [newbeta]. Following the recapitalization, the new cost of equity would be [Coenew]% and the new cost of capital would be [WACCnew]%. For the following please express your answer to the nearest whole dollar - not as millions - so that I am able to follow better. Assuming a growth rate of 2%, the annual savings from recapitalization is $[savings] and the total value change as a result of the recapitalization would be $[Change], and the market value of equity after the recapitalization would be $[newMKVE]. The way I have structured this as long as you answer each blank I can follow any error through in your responses. So for example if you miss the new beta all of your answers will be different but as long as you use it correctly in the rest of the problem you only lose that 1 point. Note that the value change could be positive or negative since there is no assumption this change is value enhancing.

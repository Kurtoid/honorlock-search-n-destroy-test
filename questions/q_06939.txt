On a remote island a biologist is studying a population of unique spiders.  Color of the spiders is controlled by an autosomal, co-dominant locus where the genotype BB = Blue and GG = Green.  Heterozygous spiders (genotype BG) express both colors and therefore appear Yellow. A second autosomal locus (different chromosome), spiders homozygous (nn) do hatch from the egg but cannot feed and dies within a week.  Homozygous (NN) and heterozygous (Nn) spiders are completely normal. Two Yellow, Normal spiders (BGNn) are crossed and at hatching they produce 20 Blue, 40 Yellow, and 20 Green progeny. If the biologist follows these progeny for a month, how many of the Yellow offspring would you predict to be alive?  (Answer with a whole number - 2, 18, 45 etc).

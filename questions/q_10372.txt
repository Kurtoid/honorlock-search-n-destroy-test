(Assume that console is Scanner object initialized to the standard input device.)(i)     r = console.nextDouble();    myCircle.area = 3.14 * r * r;    System.out.println(myCircle.area);(ii)        r = console.nextDouble();          myCircle.set(r);   System.out.println(myCircle.area());

Assume that [1] the I/O port pin connected to the blue LED of the OOTB uPAD, pin 6 of PORTD, is configured to be an output, [2] the IN_CHAR and OUT_CHAR (not OUT_STRING) assembly subroutines required for Lab 5 are accessible, [3] both of the IN_CHAR and OUT_CHAR subroutines are to utilize register `r17`, and [4] the ASCII character encoding is to be utilized. (Some links to an ASCII character encoding table are provided below.) ----------------------------------------------------- Write a fragment of assembly code (i.e., not a complete program or subroutine, just a small portion of code) that would cause the ATxmega128A1U to continually: [1] Call the IN_CHAR subroutine to receive a character. [2] Check whether or not the received character represents a decimal digit, i.e., '0'-'9'. If it does, output the character string "d!r", by way of the OUT_CHAR subroutine, and then restart the overall procedure. (Otherwise, just proceed to [3].) [3] Check whether or not the received character represents the character 'B'. If the character represents 'B', toggle the blue LED located on the OOTB uPAD, and then restart the overall procedure. (Else, just restart the overall procedure.) In your provided response, format all text with the "Preformatted" style given by Canvas. ----------------------------------------------------- Hint: There are multiple manners for checking whether or not a received character is a decimal digit. One way is that you can subtract the value 0x30 from the character and check whether or not this resulting value is greater than or equal to ten. An unsigned comparison operation is needed. To understand how and why such a procedure can be done, you should refer to the ASCII character encoding table provided via some links below. ----------------------------------------------------- An ASCII table and the uPAD schematic are available at the top of this page.

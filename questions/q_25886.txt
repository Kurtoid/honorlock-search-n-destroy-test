4. You are a civil engineer who has been given the assignment to design a curved roadway in such a way that a car will not have to rely on friction to round the curve without skidding. In other words, a car moving at the designated speed can negotiate the curve even when the road is covered with ice. Such a road is usually banked, which means that the roadway is tilted toward the inside of the curve. Suppose the designated speed for the road is to be 13.4 m/s (30.0 mi/h) and the radius of the curve is 35.0 m. Determine the angle at which the roadway on the curve should be banked.

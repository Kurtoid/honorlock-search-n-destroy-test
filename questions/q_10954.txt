Problem #3 (28 points):  The circuit below shows a SERIES-SHUNT feedback amplifier.  Some details of the bias circuit are not shown in the figure.  The transistors are biased in the active region and the dc currents are IE1 = 1 mA , IE2 = 1 mA.  Also, hFE = IC/IB = 100 for both transistors, VA = [?] for both transistors, and the capacitors are very large. A) Identify the feedback network and find the appropriate two-port parameters.  Find the feedback factor b. B) Sketch the A-circuit. C) If the gain of the A-circuit is 116 V/V, find the voltage gain vo/vs and the output resistance Rout of the feedback amplifier.

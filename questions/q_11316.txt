Which of the following materials may not be taken into a jury room during deliberations?
You have discovered a protein kinase X (PKX) that facilitates smoothened primary ciliary translocation and subsequent Shh signaling. However, the mechanisms of  how PKX facilitates smoothened ciliary translocation are not known. Please provide three different hypothetical mechanisms of how PKX could facilitate Smo PC translocation. As an option, you can also think about how you can test your hypotheses by experiments, assuming you have all the resources you need (e.g. you can quickly identify the aa substrate of PKX and can generate all the mutations you need).

Tony Rocks Inc. is considering the construction of a new production line that will generate the firm $30,000 revenue/per year over the next three years. The project requires an acquisition of a new tuning machine. The machine's basic price is $40,000. The equipment could be depreciated for tax purpose straight-line over 5 years and will be sold after three years for $10,000.  Tax rate is 40%. The machine will also save the firm $10,000 per year in before-tax costs. The project will also require an initial investment of $2,000 in NWC. The balance of NWC will stay at the $2,000 level until being 100% recovered at the end of the project. The firm's market value of debt is $400 million. The company has 20 million shares outstanding with a price of $20/share. The cost of debt is 4%. The covariance of the firm's stock return with the return of S&P 500 is 0.1. Given that the expected return of S&P 500 is 10% with a standard deviation of 20%, and the one-year Treasury bill rate is 2% Should Tony Rocks take the project?

Consider the design of two logic circuits that both have four inputs: A, B, C and D; and one output: X.  Each circuit is implemented using 4-input AND gates (with negated inputs) and an OR gate to generate the output.  For circuit 1, X is defined to be 1 if and only if the unsigned binary representation of A, B, C and D is less than 7.Note A is the most significant bit, then B, then C, and D is the least significant. For circuit 2, X is defined to be 1 if and only if the total number of 1's among A, B, C and D is exactly 1.  Which of the following 4-input gates would be used in the implementation of both circuits?

Body color of wiggly worms is determined by the alleles B and b.        B = brown   b = tan A first generation population of wiggly worms living in the forest consists of 26 homozygous dominant (BB) brown worms, 46 heterozygous brown worms (Bb) and 28 tan worms (bb). After the population was counted for the first time, the forest was destroyed but the population of worms survived.  The sixth generation of worms consisted of 5 homozygous dominant brown worms, 32 heterozygous worms and 63 tan worms. For the next six generations the land stayed barren.  The twelfth generation of worms consisted of 4 homozygous dominant worms, 36 heterozygous worms and 62 tan worms. (This is the same data as in the previous question so use your totals from that question to answer to answer this one)   How many of each allele are present and what is the allele frequency (%) of each allele at generation 1, 6 and 12?

Extra Credit: What are the highest and lowest sun angles for my hometown, Charleston, SC, which lies at 33deg N latitude? Hint: Think about it. On what dates would the highest and lowest Sun angles be? Use these dates to complete the question. You also know what latitudes receive 90 degree noon sun on these dates. Giving the dates alone will result in no extra credit. You must do the math.  Show all of your calculations.

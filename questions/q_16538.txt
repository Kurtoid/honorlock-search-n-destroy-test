(Treat all values given as having 3 significant figures.)  Box m1 = 6 kg having initial velocity v-1i=8 m/s x^+ 0 m/s y^{"version":"1.1","math":"v-1i=8 m/s x^+ 0 m/s y^"} collides with box m2 = 10 kg having initial velocity     v-2i=4 m/s x^+ 6 m/s y^{"version":"1.1","math":"v-2i=4 m/s x^+ 6 m/s y^"} .  After this partially inelastic collision, box m2 has final velocity   v-2f=4 m/s x^+ 0 m/s y^{"version":"1.1","math":"v-2f=4 m/s x^+ 0 m/s y^"}.

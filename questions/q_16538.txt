A group of twenty five homes (n=25) in a subdivision have sold in the past year. They were of sizes ranging from 3000 to 6000 square feet, with an average size sMx = 4500 square feet and a standard deviation Sx = 500 square feet. The average selling price was sMy= $825,000.00 with a standard deviation Sy = $95,500.00. The correlation between home size and selling price is rxy =. 8950.You want to fit a linear model to this data to estimate selling price using house size as the independent variable. Calculate the slope (a) of the regression line. Calculate the intercept (b) of the regression line Use the equation of your line to estimate the selling price of a 4200 square foot home. Your answer will be a triple (a, b, price in $) where y = ax + b.

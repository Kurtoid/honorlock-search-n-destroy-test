Question 16. 15 pt.) A single model manual assembly line has 7 work elements that must be accomplished to complete the assembly, and the element times and precedence requirements are listed in the table below. The ideal cycle time is 1.0 min per assembly. Repositioning time is 0.2 min and uptime proportion is assumed to be 1.0. (a) (3 pt.) Construct the precedence diagram for this assembly line. (b) (4 pt.), what is the available service time Ts (min) against which the line must be balanced? (c) (8 pt.) Use the Kilbridge and Wester method to balance the line and assign work elements to stations, applying the largest candidate rule within each column. Use the table headings shown to create the work elements listed according to columns and work elements assigned to stations.

(15 pt.) A 20-station transfer line can be divided into two stages of 10 stations each by installing a storage buffer between stations 10 and 11. The probability of failure at any station is 0.005. The ideal cycle time is 1.25 min and the downtime per line stop is 8.0 min. These values are applicable for both the one-stage and two-stage configurations. The downtime should be a considered constant value. The industrial engineer correctly determined that the line efficiency with no buffer is 60.98%, and the maximum possible line efficiency that would result from installing the storage buffer (infinite buffer) is 75.76%. Calculate the line efficiency(%) if the capacity of the proposed storage buffer is to be only 20 parts.

Some researchers were interested in what is the impact of exercise on the human immune system. They collected data on a sample of 30 individuals with y= amount of immunoglobin in blood (mg) and x= maximal oxygen uptake (ml/kg). The scatterplot suggested a quadratic regression model. It was found that the Pearson correlation between the oxygen variable and its square is 0.995. What is the variance inflation factor of the oxygen variable in the quadratic regression model and what does it imply?

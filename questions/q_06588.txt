A wastewater inflow of 265 m3/d will be treated in six identical parallel free water surface (FWS) constructed wetland cells. The cell size is 40 m long by 20 m wide. The ratio of cattail surface area to open water surface area is 2. The average grass reference ET (ETo) is 8 mm/d during the peak season. What is the cattail evapotranspiration rate (in equivalent water depth and in percent of the wastewater inflow)? How much water flow is lost, during a day in the peak season, from the series of constructed wetlands due to evapotranspiration? Tip: Use Towler's approach to get the cattail crop coefficient.

The predetermined overhead rate for Zane Company is $5 per direct labor hour, comprised of a variable overhead rate of $3 and a fixed rate of $2. The amount of budgeted overhead costs at normal capacity of $150,000 was divided by normal capacity of 30,000 direct labor hours, to arrive at the predetermined overhead rate of $5. Actual overhead for June was $8,900 variable and $5,400 fixed, and 1,500 units were produced. The direct labor standard is 2 hours per unit produced. What is the total overhead variance?

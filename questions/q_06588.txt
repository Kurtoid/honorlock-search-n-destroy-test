Bangs Leisure Chairs produces three types of hand-crafted outdoor chairs that are popular for beach, pool, and patios - sling chairs, Adirondack chairs, and hammocks. The unit profit for these products is $40, $100, and $90, respectively. Each type of chair requires cutting, assembling, and finishing. The owner is retired and is available to work 6 hours per day for 5 days per week, so there will be 120 hours available each month. He doesn't want to spend more than 50 hours each month on any one activity (that is, no more than 50 hours on cutting, no more than 50 hours on assembling, no more than 50 hours on finishing, in a given month). The retailer who buys the chairs will buy all that can be produced. Sling chairs are made up of ten wood pieces for the frame and one piece of cloth. The actual cutting of the wood takes 30 minutes (0.5 hour). Assembling includes sewing of the fabric and the attachment of rivets, screws, fabric, and dowel rods and takes 45 minutes (0.75 hour). The finishing stage involves sanding, staining, and varnishing of the various parts and takes one hour. Adirondack chairs take 2 hours for cutting, 2 hours for assembling and 1 hour for finishing. Hammocks take 0.4 hour for cutting, 3 hours for assembling, and 1 hour for finishing.   Use the chairs worksheet Develop and solve an optimization model to  determine how many of each type of chair should be produced each month in order to maximize profit. The number of chairs produced should be a whole number -- no partial chairs. What is the maximum profit ?

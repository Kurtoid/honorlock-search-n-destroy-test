Write a JavaFX GUI program with file name LastnameFirstnameExam5.java that meets the following requirements and adheres to the layout included sketch.  Must set the title of the window to be "1331 Exam 5 - YOURNAME", where YOURNAME is replaced with your first and last name. Must include some non-editable text at the top to the window (not the title) with a short phrase of your choosing. Change the text font to either Georgia, Papyrus, Courier New, or Comic Sans MS; it cannot be the default font. Font size should be 12. Must include a plain Button.  The button must toggle the color of the short phrase between Color.BLACK and your favorite color.  Make sure this color is still visible in the UI (i.e. the color should be dark enough to be seen). You must set the button text to something of your choosing.   Must use the provided image below. We recommend that you use an ImageView to display the image.     WARNING: We will be compiling this from the command line with the image file in the same directory as the source code. If you choose to use an IDE during development, make sure that you place the image in whatever directory will allow it to load by only specifying the filename without any path information. (i.e. you should open the file as "filename.png", not "..filename.png", "/Users/Pictures/filename.png", etc.)   Must include a select one-of-many toggle group to control the alignment of the image displayed. There should be 3 alignment options for Left, Center, and Right.  Hint: StackPane has a setAlignment method. You may place this group beside or below the image.  In order to actually see the alignment change you will need to ensure that your window/stage is large enough. So, you need to set the size of your stage to be large enough to see the change proportional to the the size of your image. A good ratio is to make the window 3 times the width and height of the Image. To do this you can use the following methods: stage.setMinWidth(X); and stage.setMinHeight(Y);   Must use a Slider UI control that will control the rotation of the image.  The Slider's major tick labels should be displayed (setShowTickLabels)  The Slider should have a minimum value of 0, maximum value of 359, and initial value of 0, Hint: Rotation amount can be changed using setRotate Another Hint: Look closely at Slider's constructors to find one that allows for configuration of the min/max/init values on creation of the Slider to make your life easier. Yet Another Hint: There are several ways to implement the event handling, we recommend using the setOnMouseReleased method that is available to any Node   You must use at least one of the following children of Pane to control the layout of the Nodes: BorderPane, GridPane, HBox, or VBox. You must implement your event handling at least two of the three ways we taught: named inner class, anonymous inner class, and lambda expression.  For example, at least one handler as an anonymous inner class and at least one handler as a lambda expression. Failure to implement handlers in two different ways will result in the loss of points.   Points may be deducted if your layout deviates greatly from the one shown below. However, you do not need to have a border around the pane containing your image nor around the image itself. You may place the one-of-many toggle group below or beside the Image.  YOUR SHOULD ONLY SUBMIT A SINGLE JAVA FILE. ENSURE THAT ANY OTHER CLASSES YOU INCLUDE EXIST WITHIN THE SAME FILE. IF YOUR SUBMITTED CODE DOES NOT COMPILE, YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO. SAVE, BACKUP, AND TEST OFTEN! The following is an example layout for your UI, but as long as you meet the requirements stated above the layout is flexible:

Max's Floral Shoppes is a three store retailer of fresh "Hawaiian" inspired floral arrangements serving the greater Santa Monica area. Max's has a central refrigerated warehouse where he stores exotic flowers shipped directly to him (by air) from his supplier in Maui Hawaii. The lead-time from order to receipt is 2 weeks. Max's order costs are $150 per order and his holding cost are 10% of the cost of a stem. Note that a "stem" is a single flower in an arrangement. Stems are ordered as individual units, but the order quantity needs to be a multiple of 6 -- each arrangement created by Max has 6 stems and the average cost per stem is $4. The grouping only occurs when the arrangements are created. Max then sells each arrangement for $65. Max's annual demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of  11,025 arrangements and a standard deviation of 550 arrangements.  To maintain customer goodwill Max's has set a high service level objective of 98% in stock.  What should be Max's ROP (Reorder Point). Round up the ROP to the nearest multiple of 6.   Use the Z-table from a Prior Problem This Problem Counts 5 Points

The following four questions are based on the following information: Arrow Industries employs a standard cost system in which direct materials inventory is carried at standard cost. Arrow has established the following standards for the prime costs of one unit of product.  During November, Arrow purchased 487,400 pounds of direct materials at a total cost of $1,121,020. The total factory wages for November were $131,450, 90% of which were for direct labor. Arrow manufactured 28,000 units of product during November using 455,500 pounds of direct materials and 7,170 direct labor hours. Arrow Industries calculates the direct materials price variance at the time of the materials consumption. Q1. What is the direct materials price variance for November?

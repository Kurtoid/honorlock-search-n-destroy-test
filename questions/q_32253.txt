Geneticists are very interested in understanding changes in gene activity and the cellular concentrations of proteins as cells / tissues age in humans. Several studies have reported interesting results from examinations of the association of protein levels and age in human muscle.  While there are some reductions in the number of proteins present in older human muscle cells (mostly associated with mitochondrial function), OVERALL there is an INCREASE in the number of different proteins present in muscle of males over 65 years old.   Surprising to geneticists are data that indicate that this Increase is only due in small part to increased Transcription.  Clearly something besides Transcriptional changes are occurring. As a trained Geneticist, what would you argue is the Most Probable factor producing this increase in different proteins?

It cannot meet this demand from its own production facilities and would like to buy 15,000 pairs of socks from Western, paying Western its full production cost of $4.00 as a transfer price. Eastern will then sell the socks to its customers at a price of $5.75, and will incur $0.75 per unit of variable selling costs. The Eastern Division has no other source for these socks.

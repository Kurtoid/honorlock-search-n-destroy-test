At CDE dental office, on average, 40 patients arrive every hour and are processed at the same rate. Patients wait in line for registration. On average, it takes 6 minutes for registration, not including waiting time. A dentist's assistant sees a patient after registration and assigns the patient to one of the two tracks, one for routine cleanings and another for major treatments. On average, the dentist's assistant spends 15 minutes with each patient. On average, 3/4 (or 75%) of the patients are classified by the dentist's assistant as needing routine cleanings.

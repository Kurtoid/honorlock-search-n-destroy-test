Imagine that in the fall you will be sharing an apartment (or dorm room) with an Italian exchange student who has not yet arrived in Gainesville. You are writing them an email to present yourself.  You should introduce yourself, give your age, say where you are from, and provide a few details about your hometown. Describe your family and give detailed information about two family members. Describe university life: what you study, what campus is like (if you have never been to the UF campus, simply make a few things up). Think about the differences between Italian and American universities and try to mention at least one thing that might surprise an Italian. Talk about your daily routine, including some reflexive verbs. Say what you like to do in your free time, providing examples. Also mention what you want to do / have to do  before the beginning of the semester (prima dell'inizio del semestre). Be sure to ask your future roommate a few questions about their home, family, and life. (Feel free to insert these anywhere in your composition.)  You may start your email with "Caro / Cara ___" and end with "Tanti saluti".       As with the other compositions you have written, you are expected to adhere to material (grammar and vocabulary) covered in Chapters 1 - 5 of Percorsi.  Take full benefit of the time allotted. Be sure to proofread! Think about the vocabulary you have learned and incorporate as much of it as possible into your writing. Provide examples and detail to enhance your main points. Remember that this is your chance to show what you know! Be aware that you may need to leave out some things you would say if you were writing this composition in English. Avoid saying things that would have no cultural context for an Italian, and do not name places around town.  Type directly into the text box. Attachments/links will not be accepted.   It has been a pleasure getting to know you all. I hope that the remainder of your summer is tons of fun!

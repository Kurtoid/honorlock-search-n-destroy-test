The officers had a valid arrest warrant but did not have a warrant to search the restaurant. They did have probable cause for a search warrant and were in the process of obtaining a warrant. Because they received credible information that Chili might be armed, the officers entered the restaurant with weapons drawn.

Chili agreed to talk to them and made incriminating statements. Chili was charged with gambling offenses and moved to suppress his statements to Mutt and Jeff. The trial court should:

Barney turned 18 last year and did not file a draft registration card. Barney has been charged with "willful failure to register for the draft." The Supreme Court has interpreted the term "willful" in this federal statute to require the "voluntary and intentional violation of a known legal duty." Barney maintains that he did not know that he was legally required to register for the draft, even though the law requires that all males must register for the draft when they turn 18.

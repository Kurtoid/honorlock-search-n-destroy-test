She wants names in the upper left corner of the paper--or is it bottom left? Kimo panics when he realizes that this teacher wants all work in ink, and he already lost all twenty pens that his mother bought at Costco! The class is studying political elections. The teacher tells the class to read the next chapter in the textbook and answer the review questions at the end. When the teacher sees Kimo writing in pencil she says, "Son, where is your pen?!" She tells him to come after school for detention. Kimo gets back to work, gritting his teeth. The bell rings just as Kimo's eyes are starting to glaze over while staring at "media bias" in the text.

Remember to draw free-body diagrams, write equations,  and show all your work.  (problem 3 continued)  A camel pushes a 25 kg crate of pineapples across a level floor with a constant horizontal force, Fcam, pointing to the right.  The crate moves 2.4m to the right, accelerating from 3.2 m/s to 5.6 m/s.  The coefficients of friction between the crate and the floor are  ms = 0.60  and mk = 0.40. c)  Using the equations of motion, find the acceleration of the crate.  Use this to find the net force (Fnet,x or SFx) on the crate. d)  Find the total work done to the crate by all forces.

The total area enclosed within a square is calculated using the equation  , where  represents the length of each side of the square. STEP 1: Each of four separate line segments are drawn to a measured length of 4.21 m. STEP 2 : A 1.321-m section of each line segment is measured and removed, resulting in shorter line segments. STEP 3: The longer of the line segments produced in Step 2 are used without further measurement to form a square.  Report your answer to each question or problem below. Make sure you reference your answers by numbering them according to the question or problem. You do not need to show calculations. 1. What is the area enclosed within the square? Report the answer using the maximum available precision and with correct unit(s). (5 pts) 2. What is the area enclosed within the square in terms of so-called Imperial or English units (i.e. the units commonly used in the US)? Use the following conversion factor and assume that it does not impact the precision of your result: 2.54 cm = 1.00 in. (2 pts) 3. Describe a change in Step 2 that would improve the enclosed area's calculated precision. You can make any change to Step 2 that you want except for the following limitation: only one set of measurements is allowed in Step 2. All other steps must remain unchanged. (3 pts)

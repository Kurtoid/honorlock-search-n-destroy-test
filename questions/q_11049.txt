Sketch a graph of the parabola  y=x2+4x-5{"version":"1.1","math":"y=x2+4x-5"}. This is the same parabola that we saw in the last three problems. Your graph needs to show all of the information from the last three problems (the x-intercept(s), the y-intercept(s), and the vertex) on the graph. Every point on the graph that you plot needs to be "labeled", by which I mean, if you have a point (4, 6) on the graph, you MUST write (4,6) next to that point, or you will lose points for this problem. And as I said above, the points that you MUST plot include the intercepts and the vertex. You should do this on your own paper and upload it to the Dropbox folder labeled "Work for Test #4".  I don't need you to actually write anything in the space below, but feel free to write something if you want to,.

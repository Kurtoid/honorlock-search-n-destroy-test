Read the following text: You know that in English we can say "Spanish" as slang to mean Hispanic/Latino/LatinAmerican/etc. But when we're speaking in Spanish, a similar word may work very differently. The word el espanol used as a noun can refer to the language you are studying, or, as a plural noun (los espanoles), to the people of Spain.

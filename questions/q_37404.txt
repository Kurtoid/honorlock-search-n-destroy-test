You have isolated a DNA sample from bacteria taken from mummified tissues and you hope to characterize its metabolic characteristics. You determine the sequence of the microbe's DNA and find a gene for superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as the gene for catalase. Based on this analysis what are the possible oxygen requirement/s of this microbe (ie, obligate aerobe, obligate anaerobe, etc., please name all that apply)? Please provide support for your answers and include the role of these genes (6 points).

A reaction has an overall equation, A + 2D  B + 2C + F. If the rate law for this reaction is Rate = k[A][D], fill in the missing pieces (for the lowercase letters) to the suggested mechanism below: Step 1:  __w___ + D  B + ___x___ Step 2: C + ___y___  __z______ Note: The capital letters represent different molecules. As such, it is not necessary to make sure reactants and products in the elementary reactants are balanced. It is just necessary to make sure that the overall reaction adds up to the desired reaction once you have suggested the mechanism.

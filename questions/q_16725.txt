Crib death of infants when fasting (i.e., when sleeping and not eating - therefore a low blood glucose condition) is also known as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). SIDS was often blamed on lack of proper care by the parents of the child. It is now known that a significant number of SIDS cases are caused by a genetic defect in the gene that codes for fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in fatty acid b-oxidation. If this enzyme is defective, energy from fatty acids is not available and, in addition, gluconeogenesis is inhibited resulting in severe and life-threatening hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Why the hypoglycemia?

DNP (dinitrophenol) is a weight loss aid sold primarily over the internet.  It is associated with rapid weight loss but has an unacceptably high risk of death.

Suppose the real risk-free rate is 3.9%, the average future inflation rate is    4.7%, a maturity premium of 0.06% per year to maturity applies, i.e., MRP =    0.06%(t), where t is the years to maturity.  Suppose also that a liquidity premium    of 0.7% and a default risk premium of 0.8% applies to A-rated corporate bonds.     How much higher would the rate of return be on a 7-year A-rated corporate    bond than on a 5-year Treasury bond.  Here we assume that the pure    expectations theory is NOT valid.

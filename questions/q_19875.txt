The chart below describes the distribution of levels of the liver enzyme gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) in 950 normal cows (blue bars) and 401 sick cows (orange bars). The number of cows is on the vertical axis, and GGT level on the horizontal axis.  You move the "cut-point" from 16 (red vertical line on graph - where GGT values >16 were considered Test + and <= 16 considered Test -) to 22 (green line - where GGT values >22 are considered Test + and <= 22 considered Test -).    How does that movement of the cutpoint effect Sn and Sp?

QUESTION 3     3.1.   Figure 1a below represents the world market for natural rubber. RIGHT CLICK the button to see Figure 1a   Between October 2011 and October 2012, the price of natural rubber decreased by 21%. This fall in price was due to a decrease in world demand for natural rubber.         3.1.1   On Figure 1a, label the new equilibrium curve, D1, to show the decrease in world demand for natural rubber. Labe the new equilibrium Price P1 and quantity Q1   (3)     3.1.2   Identify and briefly explain two factors which may have led to a decrease in the world demand for natural rubber.   (4)     3.1.3   Natural rubber is made from the juices inside rubber trees, grown mainly in three Asian countries that have a suitable wet and warm climate: Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. It takes seven years for the trees to mature before the juices can be turned into rubber. Rubber supply from plantations in South America has been reduced because many of the trees are diseased.   This information shows that the supply of natural rubber is always price inelastic. Do you agree with this statement? Give ONE reason for your answer.   (2)     3.2.

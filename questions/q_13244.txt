The Nielsen Company reported that in 2010 the average number of text messages sent and received each month by 18 to 24 year olds was 1,299. In 2019, 24 individuals 18 to 24 years old were surveyed about the number of texts that they send and receive each month. This sample produced a mean of M = 1344 with SS = 300,000. Has there been a significant change in the average number of text messages sent and received by 18 to 24 year olds?

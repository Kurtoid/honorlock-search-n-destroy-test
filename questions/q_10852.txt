A 27-year-old phenotypic female presented to the outpatient department of the OB-GYN unit and then was referred to the genetics clinic for cytogenetic investigation due to primary amenorrhea. The pedigree of the proband (III-10) is shown in the figure. She was 5'9'' tall and weighed 190 lb. On clinical examination, she had normal breast development (Tanner V), normal female external genitalia, with thinning of pubic hair and absence of axillary hair. She had a bilateral gonadectomy, i.e., removal of both testicles present in inguinal region, at 23 years of age. Histopathological examination suggested severe germ cell hypoplasia with complete spermatocytic arrest and Leydig's cell hyperplasia. There was no evidence of malignancy in the sections studied. Ultrasonography of the proband showed a blind vagina with absence of ovaries. Hormonal profile showed normal serum FSH, slightly elevated serum LH, and testosterone levels in the normal male range. Genetic testing revealed that her karyotype was 46,XY and FISH analysis confirmed the presence of the SRY gene. Which of the following proteins is most likely to be harboring a pathogenic variant in individual III-10?         A Androgen Receptor   B 21-hydroxylase   C DAX1   D Deleted in azoospermia protein-1   E Transcription factor SOX9

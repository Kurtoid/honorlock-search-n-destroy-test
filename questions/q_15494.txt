The welding process, PW, is always included in the tail for this particular weld.
Below is a MIPS assembly function called foo with some test code preceding it.         .data_a:     .word   2, 1, 3, 4, 0        .text        .globl  mainmain:   ...       la      $a0,_a          # $a0 = &a;       li      $a1,3           # $a1 = 3;       jal     foo             # call foo;        ...       jr      $ra             # return;foo:    li      $v0,-1        move    $t2,$zeroL1:     lw      $t1,0($a0)        beq     $t1,$zero,L3        beq     $t1,$a1,L2        addiu   $a0,$a0,4        addiu   $t2,$t2,1        j       L1L2:     move    $v0,$t2L3:     jr      $ra (a) Cut and past the assembly code of the function foo() in your answer and place meaningful comments by each of the assembly instructions.  This is required and will help you understand the function. (b) What is the value returned from foo() in $v0 when called from the test code? (c) In general, what does foo() do?
A 39-year-old man's car broke down, stranding him out in the country for approximately 18 hours. The outside temperature was 23-degrees Fahrenheit. When you arrive and assess the patient, you determine that he is pulseless and apneic, his core body temperature is estimated to be below 86-degrees Fahrenheit. CPR is immediately initiated and the man is loaded into the ambulance quickly. The ECG reveals ventricular fibrillation. How should you proceed with the treatment of this patient?
A circuit contains a switch and two capacitors connected in parallel as shown in the picture. Before the switch is closed, there is a potential difference of 10 volts across capacitor C1 = [x] F and 0 volts across capacitor C2 = [y] F. After the switch is closed and C1 shares its charge with C2, what potential difference (in Volts) will the voltmeter read on either capacitor? You answer should be of one decimal place.

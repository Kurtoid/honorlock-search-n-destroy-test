Museum owns two of the three gemstones that were once lodged in the "Triforce Crown," a famous ancient relic, but not the crown itself, which has been lost for centuries. The third gemstone ("the Tri-stone") is known to be in the possession of Collector. After many years of refusing offers from Museum to buy the Tri-stone, Collector came into some financial hardship and contracted to sell the Tri-stone to Museum for $750,000--a handsome price given the fact that the gemstone has never been appraised higher than $500,000. Museum made a down payment of $350,000 to Collector at the time of signing the contract. One week before the scheduled delivery, Collector repudiated the contract because he had acquired sufficient funds elsewhere and did not want to sell the Tri-stone. If Museum sues Collector, what available remedy would be best for Museum?

Essay 2(Approximately 50-60 minutes - 35% of grade) Billy Buffet was one of the largest landowners in the City of Belle Vernon. He owned two large swaths of land, Orangeland and Purpleland, which were respectively developed for summer homes and commercial use in 1990. Situated in between Orangeland and Purpleland is a 25-story apartment complex known as Stargell Apartments, which was built in 2015, and is owned by Willie Stargell, a close friend and sometimes business partner of Billy Buffet's.  (Their business relationship was limited to co-ownership of laundromats in Belle Vernon and a nightclub called the "Luca Lounge" in Purpleland.) The Stargell Apartments, Orangeland, and Purpleland, sat on a bluff overlooking a large body of water known as Beck's Bay; the views are amazing.  On the other side of the bay is Bayview Road. Billy subdivided Orangeland into three, five-acre parcels; Purpleland was populated by restaurants, nightclubs, and retail shopping. In late 2015, Willie began marketing the Stargell Apartments with ads targeted to "high-end" tenants.  One of the ads stated: Unusually spacious apartments and great neighborhood amenities make The Stargell Apartments one of the best locations in Belle Vernon. Just a block from the phenomenal cultural offerings of Purpleland, including live music and great restaurants; and, of course, extraordinary views of Beck's Bay are just a glance away.  The Stargell Apartments feature an Olympic-size pool, spa, and workout facility. One, two, and three-bedroom apartments all feature flowing layouts, large, well-lit rooms, with 10-foot ceilings. The Stargell awaits you! On January 14, 2016, Willie rented a top floor unit of Stargell Apartments to Victoria Conte (known as "VC"), a wealthy venture capitalist and amateur musician. Shortly after VC signed the lease with Willie and moved in, she began to hear loud music - until 2 a.m. - coming from the Luca Lounge, a night club in Purpleland that has long been regarded as a Belle Vernon "institution" because of all of the famous musicians, both pop and jazz, that performed there since it first opened in 1979.  VC actually enjoyed most of the music emanating from the Luca Lounge, but had trouble falling asleep as a result.  She would show up late for breakfast meetings and thought she was underperforming as a venture capitalist. In 1994, Billy sold two Orangeland parcels to two separate individuals.  The parcel contiguous with Stargell Apartments -- Parcel 1 -- was purchased by Karl Capitalist; and the parcel immediately to the east of Karl's -- Parcel 2 -- was purchased Mike Keynes. Although Keynes only spent three months out of every year on parcel 2, he made significant improvements to the parcel, including a second-story addition to his home. Parcel 3 remained unsold. It turns out that while the deed to parcel 1 is legally sound, the deed relating to the sale of parcel 2 to Keynes actually described the metes and bounds of parcel 3, but Keynes had occupied only the home and land on parcel 2 from 1994 (the year of the original purchase from Billy) until he sold it to Eric Brandeis in 2003.  Brandeis also used the home on parcel 2 as a summer residence; he sold the land and house to Bob Burger in April 2015. Burger, a professional carpenter, cut down several trees on parcel 2, and by mistake, cut down five trees from parcel 1, to make highly-coveted Adirondack chairs that he sold at a local market for $500 per chair. In April 2016, Billy entered into a land conveyance transaction to sell parcel 3 to Sue O'Conner; but upon completion of a survey, it was determined that the deed descriptions and the land occupancy did not coincide. Sue O'Conner decided not to purchase parcel 3. Billy approached O'Conner and asked if she would be interested in purchasing parcel 2. Please discuss the various rights, claims, and defenses of the parties.

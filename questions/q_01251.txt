int x = 27;int y = 10;do {    x = x / 3;} while (x >= y);What is the final value of x in the code above?
Three -15 nC charges are arranged as shown below, arranged around a position marked with an "x." One charge is 0.04 m above the x, one is 0.04 m below the x, and one is 0.04 m to the left of the x. Be sure to consider whether your answer for each part of this question should be a vector or a scalar.     Find the electric potential at the x. [4] Find the electric field at the x. [5] If a -5 nC charge with a mass of 0.03 kg is placed at the x and then released, find its initial acceleration at the moment it is released. [5] If a -5 nC charge with a mass of 0.03 kg is placed at the x and then released, find its final speed when it is infinitely far away from the other charges. [5]

The urge to crack down on protestors and firmly restore order is not uncommon in American history.   We've seen this reaction from the British in the American Revolution, John Adams in the early republic, and worried executives and governors during labor strikes in the Gilded Age.   What do the Kent State massacre and killings at Jackson State tell us about coming down hard on protest movements?

In a separate file, write a function that takes in as parameters a 5x5 2-d int array, and an int representing the number of rows. The function will return 1 if the sum of the elements around the perimeter of the 2-D array is even.  (Just the sum of the outside edges of the array, not the sum of the entire array.) It will return 0 if the sum is odd. There should be no standard/file input or output in this function. Do not write the main function.  Only write the function.  You may assume that other parts of the code already take care of creating and setting the array that is passed into your function.   Example:  The sum of the outside values of this array is (starting from the top left and going around the outside edge of the array clockwise) (3+5+3+5+6+7+1+1+1+3+2+3+0+5+7+2) which is 54.  The function should return 1 for the array below because 54 is even.   3 5 3 5 6  2 5 6 8 7  7 4 6 6 1  5 4 5 7 1  O 3 2 3 1

Use the following information to answer Questions 10 and 11. Considine Corporation's CFO has collected the following information: -The company estimates that its EBIT for the upcoming year will be $20 million. -The company's tax rate is 25%. -The company has no growth opportunities--so you can assume that the company's capital expenditures will exactly equal its depreciation expense (i.e., net capital expenditures = 0). Also, the change in net operating working capital is assumed to be 0.  It follows that FCF = NOPAT = $20(1 - 0.25) = $15 million. -Since the company has no growth opportunities, the company's EBIT, NOPAT, and free cash flow will remain constant over time (i.e., you can think of the company's cash flows as a perpetuity). -The company has $750 million in debt outstanding. The debt has a zero beta, so the yield to maturity on the company's debt equals the risk-free rate (3%). -Assume that the company's interest tax savings from debt financing are discounted each year at the unlevered cost of equity. (You can also assume that the level of debt and the firm's capital structure will remain constant over time and that the beta on debt = 0.) -The unlevered cost of equity is estimated to be 6%.

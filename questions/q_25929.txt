Write a MIPSzy program with full header and inline comments. The program should contain 4 subroutines. To call the subroutines, you must use jal, which implicitly modifies $ra, then return using $ra. You do not have to use the program stack on this routine as you are not passing parameters or calling routines from routines. Subroutines: 1. Load Input - This routine will load an arbitrary number of input values from input. As each item is loaded, the item should be stored in memory, beginning at address 6000. Note: the 1st input value would be at 6000, the 2nd input value would be at 6004, and so on. 2. PrintForward - Print values from 6000 to max 3. PrintBackward - Print values from max to 6000 4. Output Sum - Print the sum of the values stored at 6000 to max   You should also have a section of code labeled Main. To receive credit, your program must correctly assemble and run in a MIPSzy simulator.   Upload your text file here named CS310-Last-First-Exam2.txt, where you insert your first and last names. This quiz will be monitored by honorlock. After you begin, you will have 2 hours to complete. The quiz will be automatically submitted after 2 hours. You should not need the entire 2 hours. You may use zybook only for this exam. Use of any other device or website may result in a 0 for the exam.

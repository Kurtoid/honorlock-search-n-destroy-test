You develop an expected scenario and a failure scenario to go along with the entrepreneur's success scenario. In the success scenario, you assume the venture is harvested in year 5 at 12 times earnings. In the expected scenario, the venture has net income of $13 million in year 5, and the expected multiple is 10 times earnings. In the failure scenario, you expect to liquidate the venture in year 5, in which case, your preferred stock claim would be worth about $1.5 million. You believe that the probability of success is 30%, and the probability of failure is 25%.   You also assume an appropriate cost of capital for the venture is 25%.  Using the First Chicago method the present value of the venture is ______. Please format your answer to the nearest dollar, and do not include dollar signs or commas (for example $74,505 should be input as 74505).

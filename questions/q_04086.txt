A piece of iron at [a]degC is placed in a coffee cup calorimeter containing [b] g of water at [c]degC. When thermal equilibrium is reached, the temperature of the water is 35.0 degC. Assuming that no heat is lost to the cup or the surroundings, calculate the mass of the piece of iron. The specific heat capacity of iron = 0.449 J/gdegC and water = 4.18 J/gdegC. (Enter numerical value only, with proper number of significant figures and no units)

Please use the following information to answer the question(s) below.The Brazil nut tree, Bertholletia excels (n = 17), is native to tropical rain forests of South America. It is a hardwood tree that can grow to over 50 meters tall, is a source of high-quality lumber, and is a favorite nesting site for harpy eagles. As the rainy season ends, tough-walled fruits, each containing 8-25 seeds (Brazil nuts), fall to the forest floor. Brazil nuts are composed primarily of endosperm. About $50 million worth of nuts are harvested each year. Scientists have discovered that the pale yellow flowers of Brazil nut trees cannot fertilize themselves and admit only female orchid bees as pollinators. The agouti (Dasyprocta spp.), a cat-sized rodent, is the only animal with teeth strong enough to crack the hard wall of Brazil nut fruits. It typically eats some of the seeds, buries others, and leaves still others inside the fruit, which moisture can then enter. The uneaten seeds may subsequently germinate.The agouti is most directly involved with the Brazil nut tree's dispersal of

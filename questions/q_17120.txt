4. Exploracion cultural. Andrea is talking about how she and her partner eat. Read what she says. Then complete the sentences by choosing the correct answer. (5x1=5 points)   Mi pareja y yo creemos que comer sano es una obligacion si queremos mantenernos en forma (stay in good shape). A los dos nos gusta cocinar, asi que preferimos comer en casa donde podemos controlar las cantidades de comidas grasosas que consumimos. Por eso, freimos muy poco en casa. No es que no nos guste la comida frita, pero comerla menos nos ayuda a mantener los niveles de colesterol recomendados y a controlar nuestro peso (weight). Cocinamos juntos mucho y casi siempre nos gustan las mismas comidas, pero a veces es cuestion de poder comerlas. Por ejemplo, yo puedo tomar y comer productos lacteos libremente, pero mi pareja no, asi que no comemos mucho queso y bebemos leche de almendras. No somos ni vegetarianos ni veganos, pero preferimos comer mas verduras y frutas que carnes, aunque esto no implica que nuestros almuerzos o cenas son aburridos... todo lo contrario: Yo soy experta en crear ensaladas livianas --pero tambien muy ricas-- con uvas, bananas y fresas. Mi pareja es experto en verduras y las prepara a la parrilla, al horno o al vapor pero siempre saben bien, sobre todo cuando les anade un poco de vinagre. Tambien somos conscientes de seguir (follow) una dieta equilibrada, queremos consumir cantidades apropiadas de proteinas. Comemos pescado y mariscos tres o cuatro veces (times) a la semana y carnes como pollo o pavo, tres o cuatro veces al mes. Limitamos nuestro consumo de carne de res a una vez al mes. Firmemente creemos en que somos lo que consumimos, y queremos ser sanos; por eso lo pensamos tanto.

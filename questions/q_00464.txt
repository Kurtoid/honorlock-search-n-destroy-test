Sara Ellison occasionally makes investments in commercial real estate properties.  Sara is currently looking at a property.  Her plan is to lease the property to a series of long-term tenants.  Based on current conditions, Sara forecasts that the property will have a value of $7,700,000 in one year (t = 1), and she estimates that a 10% discount rate is appropriate.  It follows that the property's value today (t = 0) is $7,000,000. The county commission is in the process of reviewing the zoning for the area surrounding the property.  The decisions they make will have a profound effect on the amount that Sara can expect to receive from leasing the property.  So, while the property's expected value one year from now is expected to be $7,700,000, the actual value one year from now will depend critically on the decisions the commission makes over the next year.  Based on her reading of the commission and her knowledge of local real estate markets, Sara forecasts that after the commission acts this year, there is a 50% chance the property will be worth $9,200,000 at t = 1, and a 50% chance it will be worth $6,200,000 at t = 1. Given this scenario, Sara is also thinking about purchasing an option today to buy the property one year from now (at t = 1).  The exercise price on the option is $7,000,000.  When Sara calculated the value of the option today using the decision tree analysis (DTA) she estimated that the value of the option was $1,000,000.  She is also interested in valuing the option using the real option valuation (ROV) approach. Using real option valuation (ROV), what is the value of the option today (t = 0)?  Assume that the risk-free rate is 4.5%.

Cl- can be determined by the Volhard method. A 25.00-mL aliquot of a Cl- solution of unknown concentration was treated with 2.30 mL of 6.0 M HNO3, and then precipitated by 30.00 mL of 0.486 2 M AgNO3 with vigorous stirring. Following the filtration of AgCl, the solution was mixed with 1.00 mL of saturated ferric alum, and titrated with 0.307 5 M KSCN. The solution turned red when 12.33 mL of KSCN solution had been added. What is the concentration Cl- in the unknown sample?

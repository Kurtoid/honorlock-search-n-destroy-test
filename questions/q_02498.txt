Because the patient is otherwise healthy and has had a physical within the past 6 months, the physician focuses his attention on the breast lump during the taking of a problem focused history and the performance of a problem focused physical examination.

22)  Predict and sketch the 1H-NMR spectrum for 2-nitropropane:  H3C-CH(NO2)-CH3    On your work sheet, first draw an x-axis ppm scale and include a TMS peak.  Then copy one of the 3D structural representations of the compound above so that you can label all protons with letters indicating those that are equivalent.  Then label the corresponding peaks in your spectrum.  Be sure to indicate relative peak sizes, splitting pattern and ratios, and accurate peak positions (use table 19-2 in formula sheet).  Assume we have full resolution.  You can magnify peak sets if you want, as long as you label all relative peak sizes appropriately
Which of the following is a characteristic found in all Enterobacteria?
Carlos wants to purchase a lot, owned by Sarah, that is next door to Sarah's home. Carlos knows Sarah will not sell the lot to him because of his barking dogs that she dislikes. Carlos agrees with Jasmine that Jasmine will purchase the lot from Sarah for him. Jasmine and Sarah reach an agreement and enter into a contract whereby Sarah is to sell the lot to Jasmine for a price within the scope of Jasmine's authority. Jasmine tells Sarah nothing about her plan to later transfer the lot to Carlos. Before title to the lot is transferred to Jasmine, Carlos tells Jasmine that he no longer wants the lot. Jasmine tells Sarah about Carlos. Sarah tells Jasmine that as far as she is concerned, Jasmine has bought the lot. Sarah says that she plans to move anyway and really does not care whether Jasmine or Carlos ends up with the lot. She just wants her money and is unconcerned about barking dogs, which will be the next owner's problem. Which of the following is true regarding whether Jasmine is personally bound on the contract with Sarah?

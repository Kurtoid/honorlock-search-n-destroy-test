Gary owns a home, and wants to buy a boat. In 2005, Gary contacts Alpha Bank, Inc., to get a loan of $25,000.00. Gary and Alpha Bank, Inc., execute a security agreement together, and Gary agrees to place his home up for collateral.   In 2007, Gary decides he wants to build a carport. He contacts Beta Bank, Inc., to get a loan of $13,000.00 to build the carport. Beta Bank, Inc., agrees to loan Gary the $13,000.00, and Gary places his home up for collateral on this loan.   In 2008, Gary contacts Chi Bank, Inc., to get a loan of $15,000.00 to build a new car. Gary and Chi Bank, Inc., execute a security agreement together, and Gary agrees to place his home up for collateral for the car loan. Chi Bank, Inc., then files a financing statement in 2008 with the local courthouse in the county where Gary's home is located in.   In 2014, Gary hits a midlife crisis and decides he needs a motorcycle, because his boat, new car, and carport just aren't satisfying him anymore. Gary contacts Delta Bank, Inc., and asks for a loan of $45,000.00 for the motorcycle. Gary, once again, puts up his home as collateral for this loan.

It's 2015, and Gary still owes the following amounts to the following banks:                                   $3,000.00 to Alpha Bank, Inc.                                 $9,000.00 to Beta Bank, Inc.                                 $12,000 to Chi Bank, Inc.                                 $42,000.00 to Delta Bank, Inc.

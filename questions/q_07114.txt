Carboxylic acid derivatives all contain the carbonyl group. However, the stretching frequency of the carbonyl group differs based on what atoms are attached. Which carboxylic acid derivative has the highest stretching frequency for its carbonyl group in an IR spectrum?
Consider the following problem. sens-1.pdf   Suppose that the optimal values for the dual variables are: for Supply constraints  (one for each of three Sites) 0, [s2] and [s3]; for Demand constraints  (one for each of five Markets) [d1], [d2], [d3], [d4], [d5]; and for the last constraint [i]. Note that these are "made-up" numbers just for the purpose of this problem. Answer the three questions below (a), (b) and (c). For all three: on your paper explain how you arrived to the conclusion, and on Canvas, type in the numeric answer

Cold water (  c p  = 4180     J/kg [?] K ) leading to a shower enters a thin-walled double-pipe counter-flow heat exchanger at [Tci]oC at a rate of [mc] kg/s and is heated to [Tco]oC by hot water (  c p  = 4190     J/kg [?] K ) that enters at [Thi]oC at a rate of [mh] kg/s. If the overall heat transfer coefficient is [U]   W/m 2  [?] K , determine:  Draw a schematic of the heat exchanger. Plot the temperatures vs. position for the heat exchanger. Determine the rate of heat transfer of the heat exchanger. Find the heat transfer surface area of the heat exchanger in m2. Use the box below to answer this part of the problem.  Show all your work on the work upload (assumptions, schematics, analysis, etc.) document. Write down units in your equations. Solve symbolically and plug in numbers at the end.

Linnaean taxonomy worked better than previous attempts at taxonomy because Linnaeus used numerous key characters to group species together into hierarchical taxa. How did Darwin interpret the fact that most species tend to share a variable number of characters allowing them to be grouped into such hierarchical taxa?

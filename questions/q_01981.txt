It requires that all assertions (hypotheses) are subject to challenge and testing (assertions can be falsified).    When applied to biological organisms, _________explains the existence of modern organisms as the end-product of a process which involves sequential, intergenerational change (generally over a long time scale).   Darwinism is the name given to the idea that evolution is the result of the action of natural selection producing change in successive populations. ________is a more evolved version of evolutionary explanation which includes an understanding of the role of genetics in producing and redistributing the enormous amounts of variation found in natural populations.

All primates have eyes facing in the forward plane with some degree of bony eye protection. Supported by visual information sent by each eye to each hemisphere of the brain, this provides the basis for ___________ vision (which allows primates to be good at judging distance).    Primates are an order of mammals characterized by grasping hands with nails and tactile pads. These tactile pads have touch receptors which send information to the brain.  Primates use their hands for feeding and make intensive use of ____________ coordination.   All hominoids show adaptations for ___________ including long muscular arms, a shoulder joint with 360 degree rotation, fully extendable elbow, 180 degree forearm rotation and an increase is side-to-side wrist motion. Humans are hominoids and have all of these adaptations.

Male widow birds that have exceptionally long tails are less likely to survive to adulthood because they have greater difficulty in maneuvering in their environment, and are more likely to be eaten by predators. However, if they do survive, females prefer to mate with them. What is the relationship between natural selection in the strictest sense, sexual selection, and tail length in widow birds?
Saint Augustine's Confessions (Book 6, Ch. 11)  Augustine argues that for humans to have these desires for God and purpose and love, we must be immortal (and survive bodily death), because God would never put these desires in us if they ceased when we die.  C.S. Lewis and Peter Kreeft develop these arguments that there are clues to human existence that should lead us to think the Theistic hypothesis is a better explanation than the Naturalistic (scientific atheist) hypothesis--what best explains these things in humans (between naturalistic evolution or theism).  Kreeft and Lewis argue that we wouldn't have these desires for purpose and continued relationships and love and a desire for wisdom if we are not made for eternity.  Kreeft thinks that humans are designed to always grow in giving and receiving love and growing in wisdom and knowledge and these are signs that we are not simply physical meat machines destined for destruction at death, but rather, we are much more than natural objects--we are __________________ beings.

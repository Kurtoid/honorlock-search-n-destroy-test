Suppose U-Mobile covers the service region shown in the figure below. There are 22 cells in the region, numbered 0 - 21. The center cell is A at position 0.  The frequency reuse is N=3 and alpha = 3.  Suppose cell number 12 becomes overloaded with users so that U-Mobile places a micro tower at the center of the cell at position 12. The microcell has the same frequency band as cell A. Assume the frequency of operation is 800MHz, the transmitter and receiver gains are 4dBi and 3dBi, respectively, R =1km, and alpha = 3. The transmission power at the micro tower A is Pt,micro=3W. If the required minimum SNR for cell A at position 0 is 9 dB, then what should be the transmission power setting, Pt,macro, for the macrotower in the cell at position 0?      Answer format: The transmission power at the macro tower, Pr,macro is: ____________ dBW

Consider the reaction between lead(II) nitrate with sodium phosphate.   3 Pb (NO3) 2 (aq)  +  2 Na3PO4 (aq)  -    Pb3(PO4)2   (s)   +  6 NaNO3  (aq)   The reaction was carried out using 50.0g of Pb (NO3)2 and 50.0 g of Na3PO4.  The precipitate was isolated and dried, with a measured mass of 40.0 g Pb3(PO4)2.  1) What's the theoretical yield of Pb3(PO4)2? 2) What's the percentage yield of Pb3(PO4)2 ?

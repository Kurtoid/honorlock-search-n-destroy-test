3. (25 points total): A brass plate (E = 14.5x106 psi) is connected to a threaded 304 stainless steel plate (E = 28 x 106 psi) via a 1" long, fully-threaded 10-24 hex head cap screw.  The screw is grade 5, with properties of E = 30 x 106 psi, SP = 85 ksi, Sy = 92 ksi, Sut = 120 ksi, and a fully-corrected endurance limit of Se = 18.6 ksi. There is a standard washer (0.049" thick) between the head of the screw and the brass plate. Each plate has a thickness of 0.5". The desired pre-load in the screw is 1,250 lbf and the external axial load is a repeating cycle that continuously varies between 500 lbf for 2s followed by 1,400 lbf for 0.5s. Assume that the effective screw stiffness and material stiffness are 815 kip/in and 3,174 kip/in, respectively.  DO NOT calculate the stiffness of the screw, the washer, or the plates!

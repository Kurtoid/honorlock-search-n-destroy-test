Denise, a former Scheller MBA student, has been has been the manager of a large customer service center responsible for dealing with technology-related issues for users of Acer desktops and laptops. The customer service center is a 24/7 call center that is organized into two separate types of support - Acer hardware support, and Acer software support. Denise has two very experienced supervisors that works for her: Otis Anderson, also a Georgia Tech graduate, runs the hardware group, and Thomas Davens, a UGA graduate, runs the software group. Denise was so confident in the abilities of Otis and Thomas, other than helping them establishing goals and her stepping in occasionally to deal with a human resource issue, she let each supervisor run his the team as he sees fit. In other words her style in this situation is to delegate her leadership authority to the two supervisors. Yesterday Denise learned that Thomas had gotten himself involved in scandal involving him, one of his direct reports, and two donkeys. He had to be terminated immediately. Her immediate priority became "damage control" and  how to replace Thomas as the supervisor of the software group. Denise after careful consideration decided to transfer Otis to the hardware support group, and to elevate one of Otis's subordinates, Linda Manning, to run the software group. She also realized that these changes would impact the way she needed to interact with both Otis and Linda. For Otis she thought that she would have to become either more participative or more of a coach in style, at least in the short term; and for Linda she would have to be more directive until she learned her new job. Her thinking is most consistent with which contingency theory? Choose you answer from the options below

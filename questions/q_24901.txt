Attorneys A and B both practice patent law in the same 40-person firm. A is approached by CompuCo, a large corporation that sought to file a lawsuit against TechCo for infringement of a patent. A informed CompuCo that he would look at the matter but that the corporation should not disclose any more information than was necessary for A to determine whether he could take the case. A took reasonable measures to avoid exposure to more disqualifying information that was reasonably necessary for A to determine whether to take the case, but A did receive material damaging information from CompuCo. Attorney A did not accept the representation of CompuCo because he thought that TechCo would prevail in this litigation.  CompuCo found another law firm to sue TechCo and TechCo approached B to represent it in the defense of this patent infringement case. B immediately screened A from the information relating to the TechCo representation and from all profits that may come in from the case. B also informed CompuCo in writing promptly that he was screening A from the potential and actual representation of TechCo. CompuCo immediately objected and filed a motion to disqualify.  Will CompuCo prevail under the Model Rules?

Dr. Cotta is interested in the causes of behavioral problems among children. To study this, she employs the "Behavioral Tendencies" scale, which uses parents' and teachers' ratings to score children on a scale of 1-70. (Higher scores indicate more behavioral problems.) The population mean on this scale is 29.87. Dr. Cotta suspects that one of the many causes of behavioral problems is a stressful home environment.             She gathers a random sample of 100 children who have been classified as living in a stressful home. For this sample the mean score on the Behavioral Tendencies scale is 36.95. She computes the following test statistic: t = 2.40. If Dr. Cotta conducted a one-tailed hypothesis test (a = .01), a) what decision should she make regarding the null hypothesis? b) Then in "plain English" what does this tell her about the effects of a stressful home environment on behavioral problems and include statistics in APA format? No effect size is needed.

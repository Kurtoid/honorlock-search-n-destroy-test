The Deer Mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) is the most wide-spread mammal in North America.   Although there is a range of colors in the species, they are predominantly dark colored and found living in the woods.  They are typically hunted by owls and other raptors.  Eight thousand years ago, some Deer mice migrated to the Sand Hills of Nebraska, an area of rolling dunes occupying more than a quarter of Nebraska's area that were created by glacial deposition of sand. The soils of these hills are composed mostly of light-colored quartz grains.  Scientists found that after 8,000 years, the deer mice population at Sand Hills is now predominantly pale in color, while the surrounding areas, with much darker soils, are still occupied by predominantly dark brown mice.   Apply the theory of evolution by natural selection to explain the change in the predominant color of the Deer mice from dark to pale in the Sand Hills area. In other words, create an explanation for the change in color of Dear mice using the theory of evolution by natural selection. Use the following terms in your explanation: "variation" and "differential reproductive success".  (LIMIT: 200 words)

20)  In December, Amos was talking with his 80-year-old grandfather about the COVID-19 vaccine.  Amos asked his grandfather how likely he was to get vaccinated.  His grandfather answered - "Probably about 90%."  In January, when Amos was speaking with his grandfather again, his grandfather said, "I saw on the internet that the vaccine has a microchip in it that changes your DNA!  That worries me a lot. There's only a 10% chance that I'll get vaccinated now."  Amos had heard these conspiracy theories before and walked his grandfather through all the evidence showing that these claims aren't just false, but are totally ridiculous.  At the end of the conversation, Amos again asked his grandfather how likely he was to get vaccinated.  His grandfather answered - "Probably about 75%."   The fact that Amos's grandfather was still less likely to get vaccinated than he was in December, even after hearing that the information about microchips in the vaccine was false, is most consistent with what decision making issue?

The track is frictionless between points A and B. The block enters a rough section at B, extending to E. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the rough surface is 0.29. The velocity of the block is v3 = 1.4 m/s  at C. The block moves on to D, where it stops. What is the change in thermal energy between points B and C?

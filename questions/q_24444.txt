General fixed assets, as of the beginning of the year, which had not been recorded, totaled $929,000. The associated accumulated depreciation was $248,000. During the year, expenditures for capital outlays amounted to $14,250. The city accountant determined that current year depreciation totaled $31,000. During the year, land with a cost of $30,000 was sold for $35,000. The only liability outstanding at the beginning of the year was a bond payable of $500,000 with an associated premium balance of $7,000. During the year, bonds with a principal amount of $45,000 were issued for $48,000. Principal payments of $35,000 were made during the year. Interest payments of $4,500 are made on the last day of the fiscal year. The premium amortization for the year was $900. The City levied property taxes for the current fiscal year in the amount of $8,000,000. At year-end, $720,000 of the taxes had not been collected. It was estimated that $380,000 of that amount would be collected during the 60 days after the end of the fiscal year and that $200,000 would be collected after that time and the balance would be uncollectible. The City had recognized the maximum of property taxes allowable under modified accrual accounting. $187,000 of property taxes had been deferred at the end of the previous year and was recognized under modified accrual as revenue in the current year.

A large spreadsheet contains the following information about local restaurants. A sample portion of the spreadsheet is shown below.         In column B, the price range represents the typical cost of a meal, where "lo" indicates under $10, "med" indicates $11 to $30, and "hi" indicates over $30. In column D, the average customer rating is set to -1.0 for restaurants that have no customer ratings.           A student is developing an algorithm to determine which of the restaurants that accept credit cards has the greatest average customer rating. Restaurants that have not yet received any customer ratings and restaurants that do not accept credit card are to be ignored. Once the algorithm is complete, the desired restaurant will appear in the first row of the spreadsheet. If there are multiple entries that fit the desired criteria, it does not matter which of them appears in the first row. The student has the following actions available but is not sure of the order in which they should be executed.     Assume that applying either of the filters will not change the relative order of the rows remaining in the spreadsheet. Which of the following sequences of steps can be used to identify the desired restaurant?  Filter by number of ratings, then filter by payment type, then sort by rating Filter by number of ratings, then sort by rating, then filter by payment type Sort by rating, then filter by number of ratings, then filter by payment type

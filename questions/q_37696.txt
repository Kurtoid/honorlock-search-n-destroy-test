Suppose you shrank down to about 5 microns in length, and I plated you on agar with flagellated bacteria. Life is all good until you and the bacteria realize you are both running out of nutrients. Naturally, the bacteria are mad because you don't belong in their environment, and they are bigger than you (say 8 microns in length). So they decide they are going to EAT YOU! As they begin to chase after you (their nutrient), their flagella would be rotating in which direction? A. In a whip-like motion. B. Clockwise C. Counterclockwise. D. Not enough information given.

Use the answer bank below to answer the following questions. Put in the letter or number for your answer only, no punctuation or anything else.  The menstrual cycle begins with the [4] (4) phase, which involves necrosis and dispelling of the [5](5) layer of the uterus. The next phase is the [6](6) phase which is characterized by growth of the follicle and the uterus. During this second phase [7] (7: hormone/s) is/are released from the follicle at low but rising levels and this provides [8](8: R or S) feedback to the [11](11) gland for the release of [12](12: hormone/s). The next phase occurs on day [13](13: put the number in), in this phase[14](14: hormone) levels being released from the follicle get so high that they cause[15] (15: R or S) feedback to the gland that releases [16](16: one hormone), this hormone leads to rupture of the follicle and release of the egg. Finally the last stage is called the [17] (17) stage and is characterized by the[18] (18: structure) releasing[19](19: hormone) which is responsible for maintaining the [20] (20: layer of uterus) to prepare for implantation in case fertilization occurred. If pregnancy does occur a urine based pregnancy test is designed to detect [21]21) which is a hormone released by the fetus side of the placenta.     A. Secretory/luteal   F. Perimetrium   K.

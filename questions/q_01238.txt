Chocolate-covered crickets! Ant Egg Soup! Silkworm Fried Rice! And it's expensive--$25 for five crickets! I don't like the idea of eating insects.

Tomato sauce can have 30 fly eggs per 100 grams, and peanut butter can have 30 insect bits per 100 grams." Well, if I'm eating insects anyways ... I decide to order the chocolate-covered crickets.

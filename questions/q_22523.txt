Eighty college students were asked to rate two scientists, one male and one female, on their knowledge about their topic areas. Each student was given two passages to read: one passage was about the numerous bio-domes in the world ("Biology") and another passage was about enhancing the education of elementary school children ("Education").Half of the students were told that the Biology passage was written by a female and the Education passage was written by a male.

Then students rated the scientist's knowledge on their topic areas on a scale ranging from 1 ("Does not display a professional level of knowledge") to 100 ("Displays a thorough knowledge of the topic").A two-factor ANOVA was conducted, and the mean ratings are listed below for each scientist gender and topic area condition. Assume that any effects (or mean differences) you measure are statistically significant.

Use the rule of total probability to find the indicated probability.A company manufactures shoes in three different factories. Factory Omaha Produces 25% of the company's shoes, Factory Chicago produces 60%, and factory Seattle produces 15%. One percent of the shoes produced in Omaha are mislabeled, 0.5 % of the Chicago shoes are mislabeled, and 2% of the Seattle shoes are mislabeled.

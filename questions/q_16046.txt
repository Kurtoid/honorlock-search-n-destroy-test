Re: A study seeks to understand the impact of a stigmatized label (i.e. ADHD) on children's social behavior.  For this study, the following laboratory research situation was set up:  Researchers recruited a total of 40 fifth grade students who were told to complete a task together with another peer. All of the participants were told that the focus of observation was to examine their task performance. One half of the participants were randomly assigned to Condition A which involved students being told that a "peer" (Alex) has been diagnosed with ADHD in the past year (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder--a stigmatizing condition). The other half of participants in Condition B were told that Alex has had an appendix surgery in the past year (a non-stigmatizing condition). Alex, a 5th grader who was actually part of the research team, was instructed to behave in the same way with each participant (Alex was unaware of the purpose of the research). Based on Labeling Theory, the study hypothesis was that children who think that their play partner has ADHD would be less friendly and less cooperative toward their play-partner relative to peers told that the play partner had appendix surgery. Three research assistants were trained on a coding system (codes with definitions) to assess the children's level of friendliness and cooperativeness. Then, they were asked to independently observe the behavior of child participants behind a one-way mirror and code in the following way: Friendliness: (1) friendly (2) somewhat friendly and (3) unfriendly Cooperativeness: (1) cooperative (2) somewhat cooperative and (3) uncooperative --------------------------------------------- The principle investigator calculated % of inter-rater agreement between the three research assistants on the two coding categories (friendliness and cooperation) as a way of:

Consider a disk with a mass of m =1 kg that is positioned over an upward flowing free jet of water exiting a nozzle with an area of A = 0.01 m2 and a velocity of V= 2 m/s.  Prior to turning on the nozzle the disk is supported from below at a height of            hinitial = 0.01 m above the jet.  Assuming incompressible flow, the water exits radially after coming into contact with the disk, and the velocity at the exit of the nozzle remains constant once turned on. Determine the following:  The initial acceleration of the disk in m/s2; and  the height of the disk above the nozzle at steady state.

Brian Griffin is in the 32% tax bracket placing him in the 15% bracket for capital gains. He acquired 2,000 shares of stock in Stewie Corporation seven years ago at a cost of $50 per share. In the current year, Brian received a payment of $150,000 from Stewie Corporation in exchange for 1,000 of his shares in Stewie. Stewie has E & P of $1 million. What income tax liability would Brian incur on the $150,000 payment in each of the following situations? Assume that Brian has no capital losses.  The stock redemption qualifies for sale or exchange treatment. The stock redemption does not qualify for sale or exchange treatment. How would your answer to parts (a) and (b) differ if Brian were a corporate shareholder rather than an individual shareholder and the stock ownership in Stewie Corporation represented a 25% interest?

VRAAG 3         'n Ligte onelastiese tou verbind twee voorwerpe met massa van 5 kg en 2,5 kg onderskeidelik. Hulle word oor 'n rowwe horisontale oppervlak getrek, met 'n krag F. Ignoreer die massa van die tou. Die wrywingskoeffisient vir die 5 kg en 2,5 kg voorwerpe is 0,2 en 0,1 onderskeidelik.         Regterklik op die blou blokkie hieronder om die DIAGRAM in 'n nuwe venster oop te maak.        3.1   Stel Newton se tweede wet in woorde.   (2)     3.2   Teken 'n vryliggaamdiagram van al die kragte wat op die 2,5 kg voorwerp inwerk.   (5)     3.3   Bereken die spanning in die tou as die stelsel teen 2 m.s-2 na regs versnel.   (5)     3.4   Bereken die grootte van die krag F as die stelsel met konstante snelheid na regs beweeg.   (6)     3.5   Dieselfde toegepaste krag F word nou teen 'n hoek van th met die horisontaal toegepas.             Regterklik op die blou blokkie hieronder om die DIAGRAM in 'n nuwe venster oop te maak.                      3.5.1   Hoe sal die wrywingskoeffisient beinvloed word? Skryf neer, VERMEER, VERMINDER of BLY DIESELFDE.   (1)     3.5.2   Hoe sal die kinetiese wrywingskrag op die 2,5 kg voorwerp beinvloed word? Skryf neer, VERMEER, VERMINDER of BLY DIESELFDE. Verduidelik jou antwoord.   (4)             [23]

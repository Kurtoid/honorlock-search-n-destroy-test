A contractor organization is concerned about the quality of its housing construction and does an analysis of the sources of failure in order to take corrective action. The failures are categorized by the affected components. The cost of each failure is listed below. a) Develop the values for a single Pareto chart to represent the combined impact of the failure costs, i.e., category costs for the houses that were studied b) USE THE ESSAY FIELD PROVIDED TO CREATE A LISTING OF THE CATEGORY COSTS IN THE CORRECT SEQUENCE. YOU ARE ADVISED TO DO YOUR CALCULATIONS SEPARATELY, THEN ENTER THE VALUES IN THE ESSAY FIELD IN THE CORRECT SEQUENCE c) FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, LIST EACH BUILDING ELEMENT, THE NUMBER OF FAILURES, THE COST PER FAILURE, THE COMBINED FAILURE COST, THE PERCENTAGE. THE FINAL VALUE ON THE RIGHT WILL BE THE CUMULATIVE COST. d) NOTE THAT THE VALUES SHOULD BE LAID OUT SO THAT THEY CAN BE TRANSFERRED DIRECTLY TO A PARETO CHART, INCLUDING THE CUMULATIVE CURVE. e) Explain which building elements should be targeted for corrective action, based on the 80/20 rule. List the results of your calculations, including cumulative percentages.  Make your calculations to 1 (one) decimal place, for example, 6.379 becomes 6.4, but 6.339 becomes 6.3.  Do not round the value to 6. f) Explain how you would apply the so-called "80-20 rule" to these results.

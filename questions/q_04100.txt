Consider a 50 kVA, 220:440 V rated, 60 Hz, single phase transformer.  A no load test on the 220 V winding (440 V winding open) yields 220 V, 15 A, and 1000 W at 60 Hz.  The short circuit test was done on the 440 V winding (220 V winding shorted) which resulted in 37 V, rated current and 2000 W at 60 Hz.  For the sake of this problem, you are to consider the 220 V winding to be the primary.  Use the approximate equivalent circuit for all parts of this problem.  Draw the approximate equivalent circuit referred to the primary. You must specify the values of all the elements. Suppose the transformer delivers 40 kW of real power to a load whose power factor is 0.8 leading.  The secondary voltage (actual winding voltage, referred to secondary) is 440 V.  Find the primary voltage.

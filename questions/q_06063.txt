CASE STUDY #1 A 59-year-old male presents to the office with the chief complaint that for the last nine days, he has had a severe burning feeling on his tongue and the insides of his cheeks, accompanied by "white patches all over." His health history includes recent dry mouth, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. He takes blood pressure medication and shares that he has been undergoing changes to his diabetes prescriptions to gain better control of his sugar levels. The patient indicates that the lesions initially appeared eight months ago and his MD told him to rinse with salt water. The lesions subsided, but recently came back, worse than before. He also complains of a metallic taste that seems to be exacerbated with this recent onslaught of lesions. Clinical exam reveals white leukoplakic patches on the right and left lateral borders of the tongue and on the buccal mucosa throughout the oral cavity; a swipe with gauze removed the lesions.  How is this condition normally treated?

QUESTION 6         A fun activity to do in Johannesburg is to bungee jump off the colourful Soweto Towers. Study the image and answer the questions.    Right click on the button to open an image of a person bungee jumping off the Soweto Towers  in a new window.         6.1   Identify two types of potential energy from the image.    (2)     6.2   With reference to the image, what is the difference between these two types of potential energy?   (2)     6.3   Explain the transfer of energy that takes place from when the person is stationary on the tower to when the person jumps off the tower.    (3)     6.4   How would the height of the Soweto Towers affect the gravitational potential energy of the jumper?     (3)     6.5   Calculate the jumper's potential gravitational energy if the tower is 100 m high and the jumper has a mass of 75 kg. Use the equation: Egrav = mgh Remember that g = 9,8 m/s2   (4)

Dr. Cline, the owner of the River Tilt Pharmacy, is starting an opioid call back program. The call back program includes the following tasks: (a) identify patient eligibility, (b) describe the purpose of the call to his staff, (c) develop a script to inform the patient and for the call, (d) document relevant patient information (e.g., medication) prior to making the call, (e) identify a time to call the patient and who will make the call, (f) determine outcomes to track, (g) make the calls and document results, and (h) assess the success of the program.  In lecture, we talked about how these tasks could be mapped onto the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process (PPCP) wheel from a system level (i.e., how to provide the service). For any 3 of the 5 parts of the PPCP wheel, identify at least one task from the opioid call back program that could be mapped to that part of the PPCP wheel and explain how the particular task from the opioid call back program fits into that part of the PPCP wheel. (Your response for each part of the wheel selected should be no more than two sentences or six sentences in total).

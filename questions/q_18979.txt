In class, we discussed Lamport Logical Time as a technique for ordering events in a distributed system. Is it true that if EventA on one host has a Lamport time stamp lower than EventB on another host that EventA occured in (physical) time before EventB? If this is true, explain how Lamport Logical Time maintains this invariant. If it is not true, explain why this isn't necessarily the case, supported with an example. To provide your answer using Honorlock, show the entries for EventA and EventB as vectors, e.g. EventA=[0,X,Y,Z ...].

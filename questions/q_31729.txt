The logistic function may be written as either  G(t)=m1+mG0-1e-kmt{"version":"1.1","math":"G(t)=m1+mG0-1e-kmt"}   or   G(t)=mG0G0+(m-G0)e-kmt{"version":"1.1","math":"G(t)=mG0G0+(m-G0)e-kmt"} . Use the logistic function to answer this question:   The growth of a population of rare South American beetles is given by the logistic function with k = 0.00001 and t in months. Assume that there are 200 beetles initially and that the maximum population size is 10,000.  Find the rate of growth of the population after 6 months. Round your answer to one decimal place.   Hint: you will first need to find the growth function G(t) for these beetles.

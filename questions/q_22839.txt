A radiation shield is to be designed to reduce the heat transfer between two large, gray, diffuse, parallel surfaces that are in close proximity to each other.  The surfaces have an emissivity of 0.9.             (a)  Calculate the emissivity of the surfaces of the shield required to reduce the radiation heat transfer rate between the two surfaces by a factor of 10.  Assume that radiation is the only mode of heat transfer and that both surfaces of the shield have the same emissivity. (17 points)             (b)  Suggest an appropriate metallic surface that could accomplish this shielding for a room temperature application. (3 points)

pH Balance Hybrid:You have a patient who has had continual diarrhea for the past week. When they arrive at the hospital they are not looking good. One possible condition they may have is [70](70) acidosis. The lungs respond to this problem by causing a/n [71] (71) in ventilation. This leads to a/n[72](72) in CO2levels in the blood which leads to a/n [73] (73) in H+ levels in the blood. The urinary system also responds to this problem by getting [74] (74) out of the blood, combining it with [75] (75: which is already in the kidney tubule cell) via the enzyme [76](76). This forms [77](77) which dissociates H+ and HCO3-. The H+ is moved into the [78] (78) and the HCO3-is moved into the [79](79).     A. Respiratory   F. H2CO3   K. HCO+   P. Urine   U.

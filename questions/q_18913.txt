Question 5: [24 points] Green Industries purchases two components, C1 and C2, from its first-tier suppliers located in Pensacola and South Bend, respectively, for two of its assembly plants in Portland, and Seattle. The assembly plants operate 360 days a year to assemble a product that requires one unit of each of the components C1 and C2. The assembly plant in Portland makes 50 products per day, whereas the plant in Seattle 75 products per day. The products made in Portland are sold overseas, and, hence, an additional unit of component C1 has to be included in the package of the product as a spare part. Green Industries incur an inventory holding cost of $0.8/day/unit in the assembly plants in Portland and Seattle. Currently, Green Industries uses a trucking company headquartered in Pensacola to pick up the components from the supplier plants to deliver to the assembly plants. Under the current network configuration, direct shipments are made using optimal shipment quantities. Trucks used have a capacity of 1,500 units (of either component) and cost $3,000 per shipment. The in-transit inventory holding cost is $0.6/day and each route takes 5 days to complete. What are the total annual transportation, in-transit inventory holding, and on-site inventory holding costs?

Josh develops bike-share technology and loves working from home, where he can keep his own hours and wear whatever he wants. Today he'll be making a presentation to traffic engineers in three cities about his proposal for making bikes more accessible.        Being an expert on his topic, Josh decided that he did not need any special preparation for his talk. Because he was speaking online, he didn't think he needed to wear anything other than his usual T-shirt. Before bed last night, he installed new software on his computer that he hoped would make it easier to incorporate his graphics. On the day of his speech, he set up his laptop in front of his window so there would be plenty of light behind him as he was speaking. Then he tilted the laptop screen up toward his face and made sure to look right into the screen so he would have good eye contact with his audience. Confident that he was ready to go, Josh began his presentation. Write an essay in which you explain whether Josh did or did not follow the advice given in your textbook for presenting an effective online speech. Be specific.

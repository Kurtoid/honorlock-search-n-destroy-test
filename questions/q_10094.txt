Going viral Although most viruses code their genes as RNA instead of DNA, the RNA polymerase that copies viral genes works in a similar manner to DNA polymerase in humans. Once copied, the RNA codes for proteins that enable the virus to infect its host and replicate. To treat an infection, doctors use an antiviral drug called ribavirin. Ribavirin is a molecule that attaches to RNA polymerase, causing this enzyme to copy genes less accurately. As a result, a virus will introduce many mutations when copying its genes. These mutations disrupt the normal function of the virus, leading to death. Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 36-40.   36. The normal RNA polymerase of a virus would proofread the copy of RNA and correct errors.

Physical examination of a patient with a spinal cord injury reveals that she can shrug her shoulders and abduct her humerus at the shoulder joint normally.

Based on these clinical signs, which one of the following is the most likely site of injury to her spinal cord?

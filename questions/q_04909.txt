III- Problems: 70 Points  The total resistance of a parallel circuit is 25 Ohms. What is the current through a 220 Ohms resistor that makes up part of the parallel circuit if the total current is 100 mA.   (10 Points)  From the circuit below, determine the resistance R2, R3 and R4.  (10 Points)      Determine all of the resistor values in the following figure. The RT = 773 W.  (10 Points)     Find the values of unspecified quantities (show in red) from the figure below such as IT, I2, I3, R1 & R2                                                                                                                                (10 Points)       Determine the total resistance RT between the terminals A and B of the following circuit. Also calculate the current in each branch (IT, I1, I2, I3, I4 & I5  ) with 10 V between A and B                                                                                            (15 Points)       Using the superposition theorem, solve for the current through R3 in the following figure                                                 (15 Points)

A home care nurse goes on a visit and is concerned about a client.  The nurse calls the client's primary care provider, saying "This is Mary Smith, and I am calling to report on your patient Mr. Adam Jones, who is having issues with deep breathing today.  Mr. Jones was discharged last week from the hospital with a diagnosis of pneumonia.  His pulse is 103, respiratory rate 22, saturations 92, blood pressure 126/84. The problem seems to be that the antibiotics are not resolving the pneumonia. I think he needs to be re-evaluated in the clinic."  In this communication, which part represents the "A" of the "SBAR"?

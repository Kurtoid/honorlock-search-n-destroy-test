Responde a una de las preguntas siguientes: En diciembre de 1783, Immanuel Kant iniciaba su respuesta a la pregunta "?Que es la Ilustracion?" con las siguientes palabras: La ilustracion es la salida del hombre de la minoria de edad causada por el mismo. La minoria de edad es la incapacidad para servirse del propio entendimiento sin la guia de otro. Esa minoria de edad es causada por el hombre mismo, cuando la causa de esta no radica en la falta de entendimiento, sino en una falta de decision y arrojo para servirse del propio entendimiento sin la direccion de algun otro. !Sapere aude! !Ten valentia para servirte de tu propio entendimiento! Esta es la consigna de la ilustracion. Teniendo en cuenta la consigna principal de la Ilustracion segun Kant, responde a una de las dos preguntas siguientes: a)    ?Como afronta la obra de Benito Jeronimo Feijoo la necesidad de fomentar el conocimiento?

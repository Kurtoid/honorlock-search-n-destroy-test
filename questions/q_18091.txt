All agree that Jewel, a 100-year-old widow, was mentally sharp up to the date of her death last year. However, she was unable to drive and relied on her daughter, Rosie, for transportation. Jewel also lived with Rosie in Rosie's house during the last year of her life. Jewel also had a tremor in her hand and could not write without assistance, so Rosie helped steady her hand to write checks and other necessary documents. Jewel managed her property, which consisted of approximately $1 million in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, by staying in contact with her broker and making investment decisions. Rosie often participated in those conversations, but the broker will testify that Jewel made all final decisions. A few months before her death, she made her first-ever will, a valid holographic will, specifically disinheriting son Adam and leaving $200,000 to son Bill and the rest to Rosie. Rosie denies having knowledge of the holographic will prior to Jewel's death but admits she suggested to Jewel that Jewel should leave her estate to Rosie because Rosie was her primary caregiver. Son Adam wants to know if he can contest the will and what are his likely changes of success. Answer the following questions about undue influence only.

For this exam, you will answer questions about one of the scenarios from a prior lab. You have three scenarios to choose from.  You must only choose ONE scenario and use that scenario for the rest of the exam.    SCENARIO A (Healthcare): Janet is a nurse at County Hospital. Her husband was recently laid off so she has been working 60 hour weeks to earn some extra income.  On a recent night shift, Janet delivered the typical medications to her patients' rooms.  The medications are prefilled, labeled, and sorted by the hospital pharmacy.  Patient Room 2112 contained two patients, Mr. Brown and Mr. Smith.  Janet inadvertently dispensed the wrong medication to each patient, giving Mr. Brown Mr. Smith's medication, and vice versa.       SCENARIO B (FedEx): Mike is a delivery driver for FedEx.  He drives around town, delivering packages to local business and homes.  The current package Mike is delivering is supposed to go to Ms. M. Mouse at 114 Daisy Drive.  However, Mike delivered the package to 112 Daisy Drive.  The package did not require signature confirmation, so Mike simply left the package on the front porch.    SCENARIO C (Manufacturing): Mary works in a manufacturing plant in Smallville.  Her job entails the assembly of 3 small pieces to create a widget, which is then sent further down the assembly line.  Mary sometimes forgets to include the 2nd piece of the widget.  There is currently no specific order in which it must be assembled, and it is not visibly noticeable when the 2nd piece is missing.     Which scenario will you choose?

{Yt} is a time series.  After the trend and seasonal differencing: Xt= (1-B^4) (1-B) Yt, Xt is a stationary series ARMA(1,1): Xt=0.5Xt-1+0.6Zt-1+Zt. Based on this information, show explicitly how Yt is related to its own previous values and noises, i.e. find the coefficients of Yt as an equation of Yt-1, Yt-2,..., Zt, Zt-1, Zt-2, ....

The heart follows the sigmoid pattern of whole-body growth, and the growth of the blood vessels surrounding the heart is proportional to that of the heart; therefore, the size of the heart is not a limiting factor for exercise in children.
Three  positive charges  of magnitude q = [q] nC are at the three corners of a square of side a = [a] m.  The last corner is occupied by a negative charge of the same magnitude  as the other three charges.   Find the magnitude and direction of the net electric field at the center of the square.  Hint: pay attention to the units, conversions, and significant figures. Draw a vector diagram with an x-y coordinate system. Label all the fields. Give the direction as an angle with respect to the +x axis in the CCW direction.   Enter only the magnitude below. Use three (3) significant figures and do not include the units here, but make sure you include the units in the work you upload.   Points will be taken off if you do not provide your final value of the net field here before you submit your test.  After you submit your test, you have 15 minutes to scan and upload your work as PDF. Include a vector diagram and all the steps in your calculation.  Upload your PDF to the dropbox labeled TEST1PART2.

For African-Americans, high blood pressure often develops early in life. The prevalence of high blood pressure (HBP or hypertension) in African-Americans in the United States is among the highest in the world. More than 40 percent of non-Hispanic African-American men and women have high blood pressure. For African-Americans, high blood pressure also develops earlier in life and is usually more severe.Why do so many African-Americans have high blood pressure? Theories include higher rates of obesity and diabetes among African-Americans. Researchers have also found that there may be a gene that makes African-Americans much more salt sensitive. In people who have this gene, as little as one extra gram (half a teaspoon) of salt could raise blood pressure as much as 5 mm Hg.Write 1 program objective using this scenario. Your objectives must include the components of a program objective discussed in the course (4 points).
A simple random sample of 6 students is selected from a large college. For the 6 students, the number of days each was absent during the last semester was to be 3, 1, 0,  4,  6, and 2. What is the point estimate for  the population standard deviation of the number of days absent for the college's students? Find the margin of error (MOE) for a level of significance =.20

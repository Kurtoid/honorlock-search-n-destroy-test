When we multiply decimals such as 1.36x2.7 we first multiply ignoring decimal points: 136  x27  952 2720 3672 Then we add the number of digits to the right of the decimal points in the two numbers we multiplied and put the decimal point that many places from the end in the answer. In this example, we place the decimal point 1+2 = 3 places from the end of 3672 to obtain the answer 3.672. Using this example, explain why this procedure for determining where to place the decimal point makes sense. What is the logic behind this procedure of adding the number of digits behind the decimal points? If a person forgot the rule for where to put the decimal, is there another way to figure out a reasonable placement?

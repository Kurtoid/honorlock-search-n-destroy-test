The data used in this analysis comes from the survey conducted in STA3024 at the beginning of the Spring 2021 semester. The variables in this data set are: Trump: Did you vote for Trump in the 2020 US presidential election (only data for those who voted was used) BLM: How would you rate your support for the Black Lives Matter movement? (scale of 0=none to 100=complete support) FSInfr: How would you rate your agreement with the belief that social media platforms banning users is an infringement on free speech? (scale of 0=none to 100=complete agreement)   We will use Logistic Regression to predict the probability of a student voting for Trump based on their BLM and FSInfr scores. Parts of the computer output appear below.

The spring is compressed 6.00 cm and has a force constant of 350.0 N/m. Assume that the work done by friction to be negligible for questions A - D.  A) Calculate the potential energy stored in the compressed spring. (5 points) B) If the spring potential energy is completely transferred to the car to propel it forward, calculate the  initial velocity of the car at the start of the path. (5 points) C) Calculate the gravitational potential energy of the car at the top of the slope. (5 points) D) Calculate the velocity of the car at the top of the slope. (5 points) E) Now assume that there is 0.5 N friction at the top of the path. How far does the car travel before it stops? (5 points)

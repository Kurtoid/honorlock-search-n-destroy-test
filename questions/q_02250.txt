Calculate the reliability of the scores by dividing the scores into two groups (column 1 and column 2). 3. Correct the r obtained in (2) by using the Spearman Brown formula that doubles the length of the test when applied in split half reliability. 4. Change a T score of 32 (m = 50, SD = 10) into a standard score with a mean of 100 and SD of 15. 5. Change a standard score of 74 (m = 100, SD =15) into a Z-score (m = 0, SD = 1). What is the qualitative label for this score? 6. Create a confidence interval at the 68% level for a FSIQ of 121 with an SEM of 3.0.

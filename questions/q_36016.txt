Use This Scenario for the next Few Questions. Put your Critical Thinking Hat on - not everything may be as it appears! You receive your 68 year-old patient on your unit and when you assess her you realize she appears very malnourished, as well as dehydrated. She lives alone and was found on the kitchen floor from an apparent fall, and had been there for approximately 2-3 days. She had a hematoma on the right side of her head, and she had outward rotation of her right leg. She has a history of Hypertension (on Lopressor), mild arthritis, has occasional Bronchitis especially during Spring, and had a Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy 3 years ago.  Her Initial V/S in the ER are:  T - 100.1;  B/P  116/76;  HR - 86; R - 22; O2 Sat - 95% on room air.  Question 7 of Scenario:  If she is dehydrated, what plausible reason is there for her not being tachycardic?

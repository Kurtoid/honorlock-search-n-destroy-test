A respiratory care practitioner is called stat to evaluate a patient who is being mechanically ventilated.  Auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing and the patient is agitated and diaphoretic. A quick check of the ventilator reveals the following:   The ventilator settings are: mode-SIMV, VT-700ml, flow rate-50L/min, ventilator frequency-8 breaths/minute   The peak pressure is reaching 45 cm H2O and the high pressure limit alarm is sounding with each machine breath   Patient's total respiratory rate is 32/minute. The measured returned tidal volume from the mandated breaths varies from 200 to 300 ml.   These findings indicate that the:    The ventilator is pressure cycling There is a large leak in the ventilator circuit The tidal volume which is being delivered by the ventilator has been changed to 200ml

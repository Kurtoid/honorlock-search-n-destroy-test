George is the kind of co-worker everyone goes to for help. He is always willing to help others solve unexpected problems and help them think outside the box. George exhibits which of the following characteristics of real change leaders?
A closed box is to have a square base. The enclosed volume of this box is to be 3375 in3.  The goal of this problem is to find the dimensions that will produce a box that will use as little surface area as possible.  To answer this question, consider the following:  Let x = the length of the base and let y = the height of the box.  a)    You know that volume = length x width x height. Using the given information, write an equation for the volume, then solve it for y.  b)    The surface area is the sum of the areas of all sides. In this situation, the surface area is S = 4xy + 2x2. Substitute what you got for y in (a) and simplify. This is the surface area function, S(x).  c)   Take it from here. Find the dimensions (x and y) that will minimize the surface area. If rounding is necessary, do so to the nearest tenth.

A 6.89 kg block located on a horizontal floor is pushed by a rod that exerts a force F = 17.2 N at an angle th = 28.7* relative to the horizontal, as shown in the figure.        The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the floor is 0.086. What is the speed of the block 2.4 s after it starts moving? Take acceleration due to gravity as 9.81  m  /   s 2  .

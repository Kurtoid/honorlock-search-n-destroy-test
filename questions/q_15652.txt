Groundwater Flow (20 pts):  Four monitoring wells have been placed in a grid to monitor the water quality. The wells are located at the corners of 250 m x 250 m square. The depth (below ground surface) to the water table is 5.0m at the NE well, 3.0 m at the SE well, 5.0 m at the NW well, and 3.0 m at the SW well. There is a gas station located at an intersection on the SE corner. The gas station has a spill and of the many components in gasoline, benzene is of greatest concern since it is a known carcinogen.  There are three neighborhoods located on each of the other three corners (where the gas station is not located) on the monitoring well grid. a.) Which neighborhood will likely measure benzene in their drinking water well? b.) How long (years) will it take the benzene plume to reach this location? The aquifer is composed of fine sand that has a porosity of 0.40 and a hydraulic conductivity of 15 m/day, and benzene has been measured to experience a retardation factor 3.2 in porous media of similar physical-chemical properties.

32)  At the beginning of the year 2020, Juliette invested her inheritance (a total of $100,000) in a company that makes various types of machinery used to drill for oil.  Juliette checked the price of the stock every single week for the entire year, and every week the stock declined in value. Today the stock is worth only 30% of what it was when Juliette first invested (i.e., her investment is worth a total of $30,000 today). Most analysts think the stock value is likely to continue to decline into the foreseeable future. When Juliette's partner tells her that she should sell the stock now, Juliette replies, "I can't sell it now. I'm down $70,000. I have to give it the chance to rise in value again."   Based on the scenario above alone, Juliette is showing what error of decision-making?

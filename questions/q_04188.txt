Zoe Hunter is a twenty-four old woman who is in her last year of graduate studies.  Ever since she began school four years ago, she noticed that she has become more and more agitated about seemingly endless lists of things.  Zoe spends most of her day worrying whether she will do well enough in her courses to maintain her student loans.  She worries whether the other students like her, if she is pursuing the right career, if she can get her papers done on time, if her teachers will be available to talk with her after class, if she can find her favorite seat in class, if her roommate will pay for her share of the rent, if her car will be reliable, if the library will have the book she needs, if she can get home for the holidays, and how her parents are managing back home.  Zoe replays these and other situations in her mind all day long and then continues to fret about them when she tries to fall asleep.  She is preoccupied with these worries so much so that she has difficulty falling asleep, finds it hard to concentrate, and constantly feels "on edge".  Zoe tells the social worker in the school's counseling center, "I just can't seem to stop worrying.  Everybody calls me such a 'worry wart'".  Her most likely diagnosis would be:

You are accompanying a mammalogist friend to the deepest reaches of the Amazon, and have just discovered a population of surviving ground sloths, a group thought to have gone extinct in the Pleistocene.  Your evidence that they survive consists of a carcass from a jaguar kill, with the left limbs missing, but the rest of the animal fairly intact.  Your friend is ecstatic and starts preparing the specimen for preservation - taking the skin, skeleton, tissue samples, etc.  She asks you to look for endo-parasites and preserve them as well.  The lower intestine is full of elongate worms that move by cilia.  You put one under your handy-dandy field microscope and discover they are hermaphroditic and full of egg capsules.  The have a well-developed and ramified gut, and a mouth that opens ventrally on the anterior half of their body.  You send a tissue sample from the worm to your buddy in Sao Paolo and ask him to run an 18S gene sequence on the critters.  You also make a bet with your friends about what the DNA sequence will say about the relationships of the animal.  What group do you bet this critter will come out to be related to (be as specific as you can be) and why?

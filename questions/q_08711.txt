Two tubes are inoculated from the same tube containing a bacterial culture. The cultures are then transferred every day for 2 months. All of the media and growth conditions are the same in every tube. After 2 months of cultivation, the fitness and genotype frequencies of the populations in the two tubes are compared. The fitness of the two cultures is the same, but the genotype frequencies are very different in the two cultures. How is this possible?

Serial ten-fold dilutions are made from a broth culture of Bacillus subtilis in order to determine the number of bacteria in the culture.  Following the dilution series, 0.1 ml of a 1:100,000 (1 x 10-5) dilution is plated, the plate is incubated, and 87 colonies are counted.  Calculate the number of bacteria in the original Bacillus subtilis culture. Don't forget units! Cannot earn full credit without proper units. Make sure your answer reflects proper scientific notation! Use the ^ to denote an exponent, i.e. 1 x 10-5 would be written as 1 x 10^-5.

A gas contained within a piston-cylinder assembly undergoes three processes in series:   Process 1-2: Constant pressure expansion at 10 bar from V1=0.3 m3 to V2=1 m3 Process 2-3: Constant volume cooling from state 2 to state 3 where p3=3 bar. Process 3-1: Compression from state 3 to the initial state during which the pressure-volume relationship is pV=constant.    Sketch the processes in series on p-V coordinates Evaluate the work for each process, in kJ. (Fill in blanks)  Work for Process 1-2 is [W12] kJ Work for Process 2-3 is [W23] kJ  Work for Process 3-1 is [W31] kJ   Calculate the net work done on or by the system  Net Work is [Wnet] kJ    Note: 1 bar = 100 kPa

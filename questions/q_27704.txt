Melissa is a third year doctor of physical therapy (DPT) student on her last clinical affiliation. She is interested in geriatrics and is working at skilled nursing facility (SNF). Melissa has enjoyed the experience but has found the documentation aspect to be different in some respects from anything she encountered in her previous clinical experiences. She remembers having heard in school, for example, the acronyms MDS, PPS, and PDPM (for Minimum Data Set, Prospective Payment System, and Patient Driven Payment Model, respectively), but never had really thought about how they apply to patient care until she started this affiliation.  Melissa completes an initial evaluation on a 73-year-old man named Walt and determines that he would benefit from physical therapy but has limited rehabilitation potential. Walt barely could participate in the full evaluation even though it only took about 30 minutes. Melissa is concerned over his ability to participate and tolerate rehabilitation at this stage.  The next day, Melissa reviews the chart and sees that Walt has been assigned to a PDPM category that she feels is not appropriate for his current level of function. Melissa is certain this is an error, so she approaches her clinical instructor, Wendy, and asks her how to correct it. Wendy responds that the category most likely isn't an error. Rather, Wendy tells Melissa, many individuals Walt's age, with his diagnosis, are placed in this category and are documented as individual therapy modes when the patient really is receiving group therapy. The facility, Wendy adds, seeks to do this on some patients because such designations increase reimbursements to make up for the lack of reimbursement on other patient cases. "It all kind of balances out" says Wendy. Wendy then suggests that Melissa speak with the department supervisor, who establishes the clinical categories for the patients.  Melissa is deeply concerned about this situation and Walt, but on the other hand doesn't want to do or say anything that will jeopardize her successful completion of the clinical affiliation. Should she simply do as she's told and rationalize that as a student she may not fully understand what has happened or should she follow Melissa's recommendation to speak with a supervisor to advocate for changing the coding practice in the SNF? Considering the RIPS model, identify the cardinal realm in which this situation is occurring.

INSTRUKSIES         1.   Jy word met  'n saamgeperste leer (zip file) voorsien. Regskliek op die knoppie hieronder om in 'n nuwe oortjie te open.   Laai die leer af en 'unzip' die leer; herbenoem die leergids met jou naam en van. Maak die toetsprojek in Delphi  oop. Jy sal die hele toets in hierdie projekvouer afle.         2.   Lees die vrae deeglik deur en moenie meer doen as wat gevra word nie.         3.   Probeer jou program saamstel (compile) en uitvoer (run). Dit beteken soms dat daar kommentaar op kodering sal wees. Jou kommentaar sal steeds gemerk word.         4.   Indien daar kodering is wat met kommenaar uitgehaal word, en ander wat nie is nie, sal die kodering sonder kommentaar gemerk word.      5.   Lees eers die hele vraag deur voordat jy met die kodering begin.         6.   Stoor u Delphi-leers as u klaar is. Klik op die stuurknoppie. (OF as hierdie vasvra outomaties ingedien word omdat u tyd opraak, STOP kodering en stoor.). 'n Tweede vasvra sal beskikbaar wees, maak dit oop. (Dit moet binne vyf minute na die indiening van hierdie vasvra gedoen word). Dan het u 10 minute tyd om u VOUER van u projek te zip en die leer in die nuwe vasvra op te laai. Daardie vasvra sal die punte kry as u toets nagesien is.

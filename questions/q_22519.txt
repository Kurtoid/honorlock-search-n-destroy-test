The data scientist team recently collected data and found that passengers behave a little differently. There are three types of passengers (A, B, C), and each of them has the same probability of arriving at the system. Each type of passengers go through their own check-in server with a capacity of one (A check-in, B check-in, C check-in), then all passengers go through the document check process, finally, passengers A and B go to the north terminal with the capacity of 2 and passengers C go to the south terminal with a capacity of one. The process plan for each passenger type is shown in the following table (the times correspond to the parameters in minutes of a triangular distribution):    Passenger Type Station/ Processing Time Station/ Processing Time Station/ Processing Time   Passengers A  A Check-in (0.2,0.4,0.6)   Document Check (0.1,0.2,0.3)   North Terminal (0.5,0.7,0.9)    Passengers  B  B Check-in (0.2,0.4,0.6)   Document Check (0.1,0.2,0.3)   North Terminal (0.5,0.7,0.9))    Passengers  C  C Check-in (0.3,0.4,0.5)   Document Check (0.1,0.2,0.3)   South Terminal (0.1,0.2,0.3)

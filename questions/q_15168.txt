Adam is interested in determine what effect sunlight has on the growth of his plant. He purchases multiple plants that are all the same size. Adam then plants each one in a pot of the same size. One plant is placed in the shadowy back yard while another plant is placed in the sunny front yard. Every three days, Adam adds 500mL of water to each plant. Additionally, every 3 days Adam measures how tall the plant is. Please use the matching selection below to correctly identify the Independent Variable, Control, and Dependent Variable.

Eighty college students were asked to rate two scientists, one male and one female, on their knowledge about their topic areas. Each student was given two passages to read: one passage was about the numerous bio-domes in the world ("Biology") and another passage was about enhancing the education of elementary school children ("Education").Half of the students were told that the Biology passage was written by a female and the Education passage was written by a male. The other half of students were told the Biology passage was written by a male and the Education passage was written by a female. Then students rated the scientist's knowledge on their topic areas on a scale ranging from 1 ("Does not display a professional level of knowledge") to 100 ("Displays a thorough knowledge of the topic").A two-factor ANOVA was conducted, and the mean ratings are listed below for each scientist gender and topic area condition. Assume that any effects (or mean differences) you measure are statistically significant.          Scientist Gender   Female Male   Topic Area Biology 40 40   Education 70 70     a) State whether the results show main effects and/or an interaction.  b) Significant or not, clearly describe each of these effects and the interaction in Plain English.

A random sample of n = 50 individuals participated in a college success program that assessed student success. Each individual student completed 5 different assessments of student success (after 1st semester, 2nd semester, 3rd semester, 4th semester, and 5th semester). The data were analyzed to determine whether student grades improved or worsened over time. Some of the results are presented in the following summary table.  a. Complete the table by filling in the missing values.    Source SS df MS     F = [F-ratio]   Between Groups [SS_BG] [df_BG] 7   Within Groups [SS_WG] [df_WG]          Between Subjects 96 [df_BS]          Error [SS_error] [df_error] 2   Total 516 [df_total]       b.

An education researcher is interested in the relative effectiveness of three course delivery methods on student learning in a graduate course. Students are recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 completes the course in an online classroom (asynchronous learning), Group 2 completes the course using a web conference classroom (synchronous learning), and Group 3 uses a hybrid classroom (part synchronous and part asynchronous). At the end of the semester, all participants are given a common final exam over the course material. Realizing that student scores on this exam will also be impacted by academic ability, the researcher also collects each participant's GRE exam score. The researcher will use analysis of covariance to analyze the data. Match the following variables with their roles in this experiment:

A generalized reaction has the following proposed two-step mechanism:   Step 1 (slow): A(g) + B(g) - AB(g)   Step 2 (fast): AB(g) + A(g) - A2B(g) I:  What are the coefficients for the balanced overall reaction? Enter 0 if they do not exist in the overall reaction. [1]A(g) + [2]B(g) +[3]AB(g) - [4]AB(g) + [5]A2B(g) II.  Give the exponents for the rate law for the overall reaction. Rate = k[ A ][6][ B ][7][ AB ][8] III: Is the rate of change of A twice the rate of change of B? (yes or no) [9] IV: If the concentration of A was doubled, by what factor would the rate of the reaction change? (Enter an integer) [10]

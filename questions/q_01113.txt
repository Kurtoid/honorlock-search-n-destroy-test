Consider the same economy as before: C=200+0.25*(Y-T) I=150+0.25Y-1000*i G=200, T=200 TB = 100*E-0.36Y+0.2Y* (M/P)d=2Y-8000*i (M/P)s=1600 Assume that the foreign economy has increased its interest rate. Assume also that E = 1.5324, Y*=1200, and Ee=1.45. Assume that the uncovered interest parity holds. Determine the equilibrium output Y and interest rate i. Find also the interest rate of the foreign country. Provide economic intuition for the changes you observe with respect to the previous question.

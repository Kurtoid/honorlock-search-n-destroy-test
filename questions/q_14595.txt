In a system with paging and segmentation, each virtual address (s, p, w) requires 3 memory accesses. To speed up the address translation, a TLB maps the combination of (s, p) to its corresponding frame number.Assuming that TLB access is 15 times faster than the main memory access, determine the TLB hit ratio for which the average memory reference time is reduced by 60% (compared to when TLB doesn't exist).

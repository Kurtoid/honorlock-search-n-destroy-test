Name the structure labeled Letter A. You do not have to determine the region.
Suppose that two masses m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"} and m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"} collide. We know that m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"} had a momentum p-1,f{"version":"1.1","math":"p-1,f"} vector  after the collision. We also know that m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"} had momentum vectors p-2,i{"version":"1.1","math":"p-2,i"} and p-2,f{"version":"1.1","math":"p-2,f"} before and after the collision respectively. We do not know what the momentum vector of m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"} was before the collision. Describe the step by step process you would take to PROVE what type of collision this is (your options are elastic, inelastic or completely inelastic). You should describe the steps that you would take and make sure that you explain why a step would rule out or verify a particular type of collision. This should only take about 4 steps/sentences, no more.

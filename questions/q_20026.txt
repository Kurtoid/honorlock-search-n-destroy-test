Use the following figure to analyze the data and for each statement, select the appropriate response.  If you increase the afferent arteriole radius and keep all other variables constant, the glomerular filtration rate would [a]. If you increase the efferent arteriole radius and keep all other variables constant, the glomerular filtration rate would [b]. If you decrease the afferent arteriole radius and keep all other variables constant, the volume of urine flowing into the urinary bladder would [c]. If you decrease the efferent arteriole radius and keep all other variables constant, the volume of urine flowing into the urinary bladder would [d]. In the absence of any regulatory mechanisms, glomerular filtration would [e] when blood pressure increases. Glomerular filtration rate would [f] when a patient experiences a large hemorrhage.

The next few questions pertain to a new restaurant idea.    The owner of a new neighborhood restaurant was interested in learning how to entice more local residents to patronize the restaurant on weeknights.  The owner contacted a small marketing research firm to help conduct an online survey among adults between the ages of 18-64 who live within 10 miles of the restaurant to identify ways to generate more weeknight business.  The final sample size was 150 local respondents.   If the restaurant owner wanted to know if there was a significant difference in likelihood to patronize the restaurant on weeknights if the restaurant chef was a local celebrity chef or a national celebrity chef, which difference test should be used to address this research question?

Pebble-bed nuclear reactor is a design for a graphite-moderated gas-cooled nuclear reactor.  The basic fuel design features spherical fuel elements called pebbles.  Consider the tennis ball-shape fuel elements as a sphere with internal heat generation and constant properties.  Heat is generated uniformly at a rate of S per volume.  The ball has constant thermal conductivity k and radius R.  The ball is exposed to a gas cooling media with a heat transfer coefficient of h.  The temperature of the cooling gas media is T0.  Find out the temperature distribution in the ball under steady state condition. Hint: (1) temperature in the ball has to be finite; (2) surface temperature is controlled by convective heat transfer)

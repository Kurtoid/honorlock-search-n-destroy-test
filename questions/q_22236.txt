Read the case below and respond to the case questions: Debbie Vitany could not get her 17 year-old son, Carson, to stop playing Fortnite.  He'd play the game 12 hours a day.  His teachers complained that he was falling asleep in class, and his grades were in free fall.  Debbie and Carson's experience is not an isolated one.  The Vancouver Canucks NHL team banned their athletes from playing Fortnite on the road - gaming made it difficult to get players to show up for team meetings.   Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, and other videogame developers have worked to increasingly differentiate their products, making it ever harder for players to put the games down. The creators use a combination of technology and features to draw in and hold a player's attention. First, game developers have leveraged technology to allow the users to play the game almost seamlessly across multiple platforms, including gaming consoles, PCs, tablets, and smartphones. Second, developers offer new content within the game, often for a limited period of time, to keep players checking in regularly so they don't miss out. Third, they've turned games into a social experience - players become locked into playing a particular game because it is the game all of their friends are playing.  Fourth, they offer virtual goods and features to allow players to customize their characters and personalize their experience. Finally, many games offer rewards for logging in and completing daily tasks.  All of these tactics increase the perception that each game offers a unique experience that differs from other games, which drives users to play more frequently and for longer periods of time.   As a result, the videogame industry has grown rapidly, doubling in revenue from 2013 to 2018. In fact, it is now larger than the entire box-office and home-view revenue streams for the movie industry.  For Epic Games, it has resulted in a huge valuation for the firm.  Private investors made a $1.25 billion investment in the firm in 2018, suggesting that the overall value of the firm has soared to $15 billion.   However, Epic Games faces significant criticism for how they lock gamers into playing ever more. Douglas Gentile, a research scientist who examines the impact of media on users, states the games are "designed to hit the pleasure centers of the brain in some of the same ways that gambling can." Lorrine Marer, a British behavioral specialist, puts it more starkly - "this game (Fortnite) is like heroin. Once you are hooked, it's hard to get unhooked."   Thus, while companies like Epic Games have been able to generate substantial growth and profits, the actions of videogame developers have attracted criticisms that the gaming industry is acting in a socially irresponsible way.

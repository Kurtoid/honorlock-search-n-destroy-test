When you write your answer, use multiple lines to represent the tree structure. The number of lines is equal to the height of the tree. Put down "null" if there is no node in that space. For example, the tree in the picture should be write down like:    2; 7, 5; 2, 6, null, 9; null, null, 5, 11, null, null, 4, null;     b)  How to remove a node from a BST? Explain in these 3 scenarios: the node is a leaf node, the node has only one child, and the node has two children.

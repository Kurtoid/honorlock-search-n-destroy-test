Cotner Corp. is planning on acquiring Wyatt Industries.  The pre-merger income statement and balance sheet for the two companies are listed below.  Note the income statement represents the forecasted income for this year assuming that the two companies continue to operate as stand-alone entities.    As you can see from its balance sheet, the book value of Wyatt's stock is $21.25 per share ($10,625/500).  Before the merger, Wyatt's stock traded at a market value of $25 per share.  In the proposed acquisition, Cotner has offered Wyatt's shareholders a 30% premium over the current stock price, and it is a cash deal.  In other words, Cotner has agreed to pay Wyatt's shareholders $32.50 per share in cash. To pay for the acquisition, Cotner is planning on using all its excess cash (which currently earns a 4% return before-tax), and it will finance the remainder of the acquisition with debt, which has an 8% interest rate (which is also the before-tax cost of debt capital). Cotner anticipates that synergies from the merger will generate $400 in additional revenue this year and the merger will decrease operating expenses by $228 this year. To keep things simple, you can assume that the merger will not generate an amortization charge.  All companies face a flat 25% tax rate. What will Cotner's forecasted earnings per share (EPS) be for the upcoming year after taking into account the anticipated effects of the merger?

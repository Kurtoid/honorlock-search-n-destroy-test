When 1.00 kg of solid mercury at its melting temperature of -39.0degC is placed in a 0.500 kg aluminum calorimeter filled with 1.20 kg of water at 20.0degC, the final temperature of the mixture is found to be 16.5degC. What is the latent heat of fusion of mercury in J/kg?
Short Answer Scenario 2: Imagine you read a news headline that states: "Taking notes by hand may lead to better learning." In the study, researchers had students take notes on a TED talk in a classroom and then tested their understanding of the material with a multiple-choice exam. A third of the students were randomly assigned to take notes with a laptop, another third was randomly assigned to take notes with an iPad, and the last third was randomly assigned to take notes by hand. The results suggested that there was a statistically significant difference in exam scores such that participants who took notes by hand performed significantly better than the participants who took notes by laptop or iPad. Additional Study Details: The researchers controlled for the video content (all participants watched the same TED talk), no participants were allowed to access their notes during the exam, and they were all given the same exam with the same time limit. In addition, they did not allow participants to access anything on the laptop or iPad besides the document they used to take notes. Part 1: Identify and define the three criteria of causation. Part 2: Note whether or not these researchers have met each criterion and explain why/why not. Grading:  Identify and define the three criteria of causation (3 points). Note whether each criterion is met and why/why not (3 points).

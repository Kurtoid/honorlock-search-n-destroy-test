"A recent study, following more than 2,500 New Yorkers for 9+ years, found that people who drank diet soda every day had a 61% higher risk of vascular events, including stroke and heart attack, compared to those who avoided diet drinks. For this study, Hannah Gardner's research team randomly surveyed 2,564 New Yorkers about their eating behaviors, exercise habits, as well as cigarette and alcohol consumption. Participants were also given physical check-ups, including blood pressure measurements and blood tests for cholesterol and other factors that might affect the risk for heart attack and stroke. The increased likelihood of vascular events remained even after Gardener and her colleagues accounted for risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. The researchers found no increased risk among people who drank regular soda." The findings of this study suggest that consuming diet soda might lead to increased risk for heart attacks and strokes.

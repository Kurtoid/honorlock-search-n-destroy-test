In Koi fish, R (red/deep orange) and r (white) are codominant alleles and heterozygotes are mottled orange and white. In the population of Koi in Hattingboro Pond, the frequency of allele r is 0.5 in the population and the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There are 40 Koi in the pond. How many Koi do you expect to be red/deep orange fish? Use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to obtain your answer.Write the numerical response only (i.e. the number)

The following table shows the results from polygraph (lie detector) experiments conducted by researchers Charles R. Honts (Boise State University) and Gordon H. Barland (Department of Defense Polygraph Institute).  In each case, it was known if the subject lied or did not lie, so the table indicates when the polygraph test was correct.  This data was published in your book.   Write each of the following answers as a fraction or decimal rounded to three decimal places.  If you randomly select ONE person from the study, find the probability that they: a.  Lied OR the polygraph test indicated that they lied. b.  Did not lie, GIVEN that the polygraph test indicated that they did lie.

6) Floyd and Greta are studying metabolic pathways for an exam in medical school.  There are three main pathways that they need to study: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs' cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation.  Floyd and Greta both work through the three pathways 30 times each and do so in the exact same way. The only difference is in the order they go through the pathways.  Floyd goes through the pathways in blocks. He goes through glycolysis 30 times, then the citric acid cycle 30 times, then oxidative phosphorylation 30 times.  Greta goes through the pathways in triplets.  She goes through glycolysis once, then the citric acid cycle once, then oxidative phosphorylation once. She then repeats that triplet order 29 more times.  All other things being equal, you would expect _______ to perform better when tested on the pathways on an exam because their practice was more ___________.

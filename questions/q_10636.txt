Problem 3 (16 points). You are a manager in an IT company. You ask your security specialists to design a new encryption scheme that uses some block cipher (e.g. AES) as a building block and has some properties useful for your application. To make sure the schemes are secure you also ask the specialists to prove security of their schemes based on the PRF security of the block cipher and to present the resulting concrete security statements.In a week you get 4 scheme designs  that have the desired properties and similar efficiency (take equal time to encrypt and decrypt messages of equal length). The schemes are accompanied by the following security statements. For every efficient adversary  attacking IND-CCA security of the encryption scheme by making  queries to its LR-encryption oracle, of total length

Operative Report Preoperative Diagnosis: Mass, superior aspect of the left breast Postoperative Diagnosis: Benign mass, superior aspect of the left breast Operation: Excision The patient is a female who has had a lump palpable over the superior aspect of the left breast for the past several months. It has been observed in the office. I had done a needle aspiration and did not get any fluid out. After multiple observations, the patient was very concerned about carcinoma and wanted to have this area excised. Surgical Technique: The patient was lying down supine. The left breast was scrubbed with Betadine scrub and paint and draped in the classical fashion. The patient has a transverse incision near where we are feeling this lump, which was over about the 11 o'clock position, high up in the superior aspect of the left breast. A transverse incision was made underneath the breast tissue and adipose tissue was completely taken out. Hemostatic was ascertained with electrocoagulation. The wound was closed using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures, the skin was closed with subcuticular running 5-0 Dexon. Benzoin and Steri-Strips and a pressure dressing were applied. All counts were normal. It was the impression of the pathologist that it represented a benign process in the left breast.

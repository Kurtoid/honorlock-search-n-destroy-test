Ford Motor Company Manufacturing in Mexico & Canada (20 pts.): Ford Motor Company's top selling SUV is the Ford Explorer.  Ford purchases all of its drive chain systems for the Ford Explorer from manufacturers in Mexico and the chassis components from manufacturers in Canada. The company has recently completed a cost savings initiative on the Explorer which resulted in a cost reduction on the entire vehicle by 2.75%. The cost of the vehicle before the cost savings initiative was $23,400.  The drive chain system makes up 25% of the total Explorer costs and the chassis 8% of the total vehicle costs.  There has been a recent election in Mexico with renewed optimism about the Mexican economy.  As a result, the company is now worried the Mexican peso will increase in value by as much as 15% compared to the U.S. dollar.  Additionally, the company's foreign exchange brokers believe the Canadian dollar could decrease in value compared to the U.S. dollar by 10%.  How would a 15% appreciation of the peso against the dollar and a 10% decrease in value of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar impact total Ford Explorer costs?  Should the company be concerned all or part of the cost savings initiative would be wiped out by these exchange rate changes?  Show all your calculations supporting your position.

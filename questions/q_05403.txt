The following picture shows four uniform charge distributions, where the all charges are positive and fixed in place and cannot move. Assume that the positive x-direction is to the right and the positive y-direction is toward the top of the page in each figure. Three of the distributions produce an electric field the points only in the +y-direction at the indicated point in space, P. The remaining distribution produces an electric field that has components in both the horizontal and vertical directions at point P. Each point P is centered horizontally with respect to the charge distribution. This problem is worth 10 points total. (a) Which distribution creates the electric field with both horizontal and vertical components at P? (Simply write which distribution). (b) Why does this distribution create this result? (Use no more than 3 sentences to describe your reasoning. (c) Why do the others create an electric field that points only vertically. (Use no more than three sentences to describe your reasoning).

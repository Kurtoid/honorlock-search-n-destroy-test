Pressley sues Dante in Florida state court on January 1, 2020, alleging negligence and seeking $100,000 in damages after Dante's car collides with Pressley's. Dante files numerous pre-answer motions, including a motion challenging service of process, venue and to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The state trial judge denies all claims in an order dated October 1, 2020. The case proceeds to extensive discovery and, during a deposition of Bill on December 27, 2020, Pressley learns that Dante is an officer of the Florida Bureau of Investigation, a state law enforcement agency, and that Dante was actually following Pressley as part of an investigation. With the state court's permission, on December 31, 2020, Pressley then amends her complaint to add a claim under 42 U.S.C.

On January 5, 2021, Dante files a notice of removal, removing the case to federal court. Which of the following is true?

QUESTION 2 CREDITORS RECONCILIATION                 Sally Fitzhenry runs a small bakery called Fitz Bakery in Edenvale, Johannesburg, which doubles up as a coffee shop. She provides baked goods to various school tuck shops in the area, which have entered into credit agreements with her. All her raw materials are purchased on credit from Micra Wholesalers, Pete's Baking Supplies and The Plastic Warehouse. Sally banks with CBM Bank.                 The following information was taken from the financial records of Fitz Bakery as at 31 January 2021:                         31 January 2021          CREDIT TERMS     Debtors Control   86 521       30 days, less 5% discount     Creditors Control   178 624       60 days, less 3% discount                 DEBTORS AGE ANALYSIS (31 Jan)     Creditors List:           Current                R11 648        Micra Wholesalers   31 895       30 days                R26 452        Pete's Baking Supplies   33 150       60 days                R31 430        The Plastic Warehouse   74 481       90+ days                             R16 991                                       Sally's bookkeeper had resigned and worked her notice period in December. Sally therefore took it upon herself to manage the recording and reporting of the financial information for January 2021, despite her limited knowledge of Accounting. As a result, Sally misplaced and lost some source documents, other entries were omitted or entered incorrectly in her journals and ledgers, which have caused the Creditors Control account and Creditors List to not balance.                 The following totals were taken from the journals on 31 January 20:     Total of the Creditors Control column in the CJ   R 42 360     Total of the Creditors Control column in the CAJ   R   8 110     Total of the creditors Control column in the CPJ   R 18 762     Total of the Debtors Control column in the DJ   R 21 640

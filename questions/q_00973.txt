Choose one of the topics below on which to write your final exam essay. Since you will be typing in Canvas, you will not be able to set up your answer in MLA format, so instead, type your name at the top, hit enter, type a title for your essay, hit enter, and begin your essay. Include a space between paragraphs rather than trying to indent the first line of each paragraph. Quotes and citations, however, do need to be in correct MLA format.  Analyze the changing poetic voice as revealed through Dickinson's "I Could Not Stop for Death," Frost's "Out, Out -," and Eliot's "The Waste Land." Focus on the speakers and their discussions of death. Come to a conclusion on what their different voices divulge about the ever-altering poetic outlook on life and death. Use specific examples of the poems throughout the essay that support your ideas. Remember, do not only discuss the subject matter of the poems. Look at what that subject matter reveals about the different voices of these poets.     Analyze how the view of women and their place in society changes from James' The Beast in the Jungle to Hemingway's "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber" to Cisneros' "Woman Hollering Creek." Alternately, you may use Hurston's "Sweat" in place of either Hemingway or Cisneros. Make sure to include details from each work and that you make a point about women's place in society. Include historical and/or cultural events that also affected women and that are reflected in the works.

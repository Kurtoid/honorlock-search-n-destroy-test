Big essay time!  In the space below, write an essay that describes HOW one parental cell in the body (e.g., an epithelial cell within your digestive system) divides into two identical daughter cells.    Start your story with this epithelial cell in G0 phase and progress through all the stages of the cell cycle until two identical daughter cells are created. For each phase of the cell cycle, give a BRIEF explanation of of the most important events that happen.  Don't just say, "X phase leads to Y phase, which then leads to Z phase, etc."  That is too "low rent" for us, so be descriptive, but also be brief. Make sure to also give a BRIEF description of WHEN and HOW DNA replication occurs. Finally, as your story progresses, make sure to mention when DNA exists as chromatids, sister chromatids, or chromatin.  As always, you MUST write in complete sentences with proper grammar, capitalization, and punctuation to get full points.  This essay can be fully answered in 10 - 15ish complete sentences.  This essay is also worth 10% of your grade on this exam, so try not to spend more than approximately 10% of your exam time on it (that's 10-15 minutes for the standard 2 hour exam duration). May the Force be with you!

Final Exam Instructions and Prompt  There will be 2 parts to this exam, both of which you can complete on one Word document and upload to the Final Exam assignment. Part One is the grammar part of the test, and you will use your Langan textbook to access the actual exam pieces.  Part Two will be a paragraph writing piece.  You will have two hours to complete the exam splitting the time between the two parts in whatever way you would like. Decide which part you'd like to complete first--grammar or writing.  Either one is okay to complete first.  Remember, you must complete all the work on your own. You are allowed to use your book throughout the exam, but you MUST NOT access the internet or collaborate with anyone while you take this exam. Failure to follow these policies will result in a zero grade and a report to the Academic Integrity Committee.   Part One--Grammar  Complete the following combined mastery and editing tests that start on page 462 in your book (these are found in the Reinforcement of the Skills section of the book given directly before the Readings of Writing section).  Page numbers are listed.  Be sure to read the instructions for each test carefully because most ask you to correct the error by writing out the entire sentence rather than just identify it! Be very sure you are taking the correct tests by double checking the page number and test names and numbers.    Fragments and Run-Ons Combined Mastery Test 2 page 462--Provide the corrected sentences as well as the error type.   Faulty Modifiers and Parallelism Combined Mastery Test 2 page 468--Provide the corrected sentences as well as the error type.   Combined Editing Test 5 page 506--Please provide the corrected paragraph written out and the error letters listed or a scan (PDF) of the page with your corrections.   Combined Editing Test 8 page 509-- Please provide the corrected paragraph written out and the error letters listed or a scan (PDF) of the page with your corrections.   Part Two--Paragraph Writing  Write a well-developed paragraph on the following topic.  Be sure to begin with a clear topic sentence, develop with good details and examples, and finish with a summary sentence.  Your paragraph should be at least 12 sentences long, and you need to use good transitions to separate your sub-points. Proofread carefully before submitting!  Topic: You should write a paragraph in which you give advice for students who are starting their degree or degree completion program (imagine you are writing it to me so that I can then pass that advice on to them).  Choose 2 good pieces of advice to give to these new students and consider what advice will help them to succeed in their programs.

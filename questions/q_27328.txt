1Shakespeare wrote that "all the world's a stage." 2He meant that everyone has at least one part, or role, to play in life. 3In fact, every role we play has an "on stage" and a "backstage" area; in the first area, we're on our best behavior; but in the second area, we can "let our hair down." 4For example, in the dining room, a waiter is "on stage."5No matter how rushed he is or how annoyed he feels, a waiter is expected to be polite and helpful to his customers. 6Once he returns to the kitchen, however, it's another matter. 7There he is "backstage" and can let his true feelings show. 6In the kitchen, the waiter can make sarcastic remarks about the customers or even joke about serving a plate of food that's been dropped. Write the number of the sentence that states the main idea of the paragraph. Type the number and do not write out the number. For example: (2)NOT (two).
In a population of 100 diploid clams, two alleles at a single locus control the ability to detoxify bacterial contaminants. The allele D codes for an enzyme that can detoxify the contaminant and is completely dominant to d, which codes for a nonfunctional form of the enzyme. In a population of clams, you find 84 individuals that can detoxify and 16 that cannot. The total number of alleles in the gene pool of this population is [blank1] and the frequency of the recessive allele is [blank2]. Assuming that this population remains in Hardy Wienberg equilibrium, the expected frequency of clams that can detoxify the bacterial contaminants is [blank3]

One species of moth (species A) carries an inheritable, genetic mutation that makes it a dark brown color (it is usually white). In the particular forest where it lives, air pollution has made most of the tree trunks turn a much darker color. The moths with the genetic mutation are able to better hide from predators on the trees than the lighter moths. Over several generations almost all of the moths in this area are darker colored.   Another species of moth (species B) carries an inheritable genetic mutation that causes their offspring to develop spots along the edge of their wing. Several of these spotted moths migrate to an unpopulated patch of forest and breed. Over several generations almost all of the moths in this area have spotted wings.  Question: Which of the species (A or B), is exhibiting evolution based on natural selection?

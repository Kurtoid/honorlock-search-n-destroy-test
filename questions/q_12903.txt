A Microtubules: A1       what is the structural building block used to make the polymer in a cell? A2       What nucleotide is bound to the structural building block listed above? A3       Once the polymer is made in  cells, does the polymer have polarity? A4       What motor proteins (if any) move along the polymer? A5       In what direction (s) do the motors above move?   B Intermediate filaments: B1       what is the structural building block used to make the polymer in a cell? B2       What nucleotide is bound to the structural building block listed above? B3       Once the polymer is made in  cells, does the polymer have polarity? B4       What motor proteins (if any) move along the polymer? B5       In what direction (s) do the motors above move?   C Microfilaments: C1       what is the structural building block used to make the polymer in a cell? C2       What nucleotide is bound to the structural building block listed above?

For a clinical study of a new medication, 500 adults with high blood pressure are selected at random from a nationwide patient registry, 238 men and 262 women. Half of the men and half of the women are selected to receive 200mg of the new medication, with the remainder of the participants receiving a placebo, distributed by mail from the research center in unmarked packages.  At the beginning of the study, and again after 30, 60, and 120 days, the patients are told to report to a third-party clinic to measure their blood pressure, and the results are mailed to the research center for comparison. Suppose that when the results for both men and women are averaged together, the patients receiving the treatment had an average decrease in their blood pressure of 3.2 points, with a standard deviation of 1.1 points, while the patients receiving the placebo had an average decrease in their blood pressure of 2.7 points, with a standard deviation of 0.9 points.

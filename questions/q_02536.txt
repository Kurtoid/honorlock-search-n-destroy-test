Lancers 4 Life, Inc.  has monthly fixed costs totaling $1,250,000 and variable costs of $8 per unit. Each unit of product is sold for $20. What is the break-even point in units?
Additional examination of the virus reveals that its genome consists of the nucleotides Adenine, Guanine, Thymine, and Cytosine.  Further analysis reveals that the amount of Adenine is equal to the amount of Thymine, and the amount of Guanine is equal to the amount of Cytosine.  Given what you know about nucleic acids, you can reasonably conclude that the genome of this virus is _____.

Which question during the assessment of a diabetic patient will help the nurse identify autonomic neuropathy?
What volume of 0.1000 M NaOH is required to completely neutralize a solution of 0.281 g of citric acid (H3C6H5O7; molar mass = 192.12 g/mol) dissolved in 250.0 mL of water? Citric acid is triprotic, so the balanced neutralization reaction is as follows: H3C6H5O7(aq) + 3NaOH(aq) - Na3C6H5O7(aq) + 3H2O(l)

Use the following information to answer the question.   The phylum Cycliophora was discovered in 1995. They are tiny organisms that live in large numbers on the outsides of the mouthparts and appendages of lobsters. The feeding stage permanently attaches to the lobster via an adhesive disk and collects scraps of food from its host's feeding by capturing the scraps in a current created by a ring of cilia. The body is saclike and has a U-shaped intestine that brings the anus close to the mouth. Cycliophorans are coelomates, do not molt (though their host does), and their embryos undergo spiral cleavage.   Which of these features is least useful in assigning the phylum Cycliophora to a clade of animals?

At the end of 2016, Marc's internal system reported ending inventory of $100,000 and a LIFO reserve of $12,000 resulting in an inventory balance of $88,000 on Marc's externally reported balance sheet. During 2017, Marc reported COGS of $950,000 on its externally reported income statement. At the end of 2017, Marc's internal accounting system reported ending inventory of $120,000, and that its LIFO reserve increased to $15,000. What would Marc have reported for COGS, if Marc used FIFO instead of LIFO for external reporting purposes?

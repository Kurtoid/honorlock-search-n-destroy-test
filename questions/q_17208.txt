QUESTION 3     A man stands on the bridge, which is 15m above the ground, with a ball in his hand, ready to throw it upwards. As soon as the man moving towards him is 20m away from him, he throws the ball upright in the air over the railing of the bridge.     3.1   Calculate the initial velocity of the ball if it takes the ball 0.3 s to reach the maximum height. Use downwards as positive.   (3)         A ball is dropped from a height of 0.9m above the horizontal surface. Use downwards as positive for all calculations.         3.2   Prove that the speed of the ball is 4.2m.s-1 when it reaches the surface.   (2)     3.3   Explain the difference between free fall and projectile motion.   (3)     3.4   Once the ball reaches the surface, it bounces upwards. The effect of the bounce is to reduce the speed by two thirds of the value in Question 3.2. Calculate the change in velocity during the collision.   (3)     3.5   The ball takes 0.43 seconds to reach the surface. Draw a sketch graph to represent the velocity of the ball from the moment it is dropped until it reaches the maximum height after the first bounce. Assume that the time of the bounce is negligible. Show all calculations and indicate all important values on the graph.   (6)             [17]

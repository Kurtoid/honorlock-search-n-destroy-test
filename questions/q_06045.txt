Identify and correct all the mistakes in the following code snippet which calculates the summation of the following series for a given number x, where k ranges from 1 to N (N is again given by the user):  You cannot add whole new lines of code. To write your response, mention the line number followed by the incorrect code in the line and then the correct code. For example: Line 5: for ii=1:1:n should be for ii=1:1:100000 (this is just an example!)       clc; clear   x = input('Enter the value of x: ');  N = input('Enter the value of N: '); .  sum = 1; .  for k = 1:1:N       fact = 0;       for ii = 1:2:k             fact = fact * ii;       end       newterm = fact + 1/x^k-1;       sum = newterm;  end .  fprintf('The sum of series is %g ', sum);

A company has contracted to produce two products, A and B, over the months of June, July, and August. The total production capacity (expressed in hours) varies monthly. The following table provides the basic data of the situation:      June July August   Demand for A (units) 500 5000 750   Demand for B (units) 1000 1200 1200   Capacity (hours) 3000 3500 3000      The production rates in units per hour are 1.25 and 1 for products A and B, respectively. All demand must be met. However, demand for a later month may be filled from the production in an earlier one. For any carryover from one month to the next, holding cost of $.90 and $.75 per unit per month are charged for products A and B, respectively. The unit production costs for the two products are $30 and $28 for A and B, respectively.    Only develop a mathematical model to determine the best production schedule for the two products (do not find the optimal solution).    Perform calculations on your paper and take a photo of your work. Then, save the image as a response to your computer. Upload that file to this exam for credit.

A crank arm consists of a solid segment of length b1 = 80-mm and diameter d = 25-mm, a segment of length b2 = 140-mm and segment of length b3 = 40-mm as shown in the figure. Two loads P act as shown, one parallel to -x and another parallel to -y. Each loads P equals to 1.5-kN.   Based on above information: QUESTION 1.26: At point B , what is the maximum shear stress (tau max) ?  [Enter your answer in N and mm ]
A vector has a magnitude of 40.0 units and points 35.0deg above the positive x axis. A second vector has a magnitude of 65.0 units and points in the negative x direction.  Use the component method of vector addition to find the magnitude and direction, relative to the positive x axis, of the resultant

Consider the halogen in period 3. For this element, answer the following questions: (1 point each response; 6 points total)i. First, write the identity of the halogen in period 3. The rest of the answers will be graded as though your answer for this is correct, meaning if you assign the wrong element here but the rest of your work is correct based on this assumption, you will lose only 1 point for assigning the wrong element. If a question is correct for the correct element but not correct for your assigned element, you will not receive credit for that response.ii. Would the halogen in period 3 be expected to have a higher or lower melting point than the alkaline earth metal in period 3?iii. Is the halogen in period 3 expected to behave more similarly to iodine or sulfur?iv. Determine the chemical formula of the compound that would be formed when the halogen in period 3 reacts with potassium. v. Is your answer to question d an ionic or covalent compound? vi. Is the compound you wrote in question d likely to conduct electricity when dissolved in water?

In a random sample of 200 Floridians, 25.6% of the residents were considered to be obese. A 99% confidence for the proportion of Floridians are obese was found and the CI is (0.17561, 0.33439). For a 99% confidence interval, find each of the following.   Show work on your paper, but also place your answers below.  Round your answers to 3 places behind the decimal. a)  Critical value = [cv] b)  Width of the interval = [width] c)  Margin of error =[me] d) Standard of error = [se]

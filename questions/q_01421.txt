This question and the two that follow it are the three long answer questions. Answer two of the three. This question relates to forage plant regrowth following a relatively close (short height) defoliation event. The first two parts of the question relate to the three plants we discussed in lab, bahiagrass, rhizoma peanut, and elephantgrass. Describe the forage regrowth response during the first two weeks following defoliation, including length of the lag phase. What is the major factor causing differences observed? Describe the forage growth response during Weeks two through eight of the regrowth period for the three forages. Why are they similar or different? Do these responses provide any information about how frequently we should cut these forages? If yes, what do they tell us specifically? Lastly, pick ONLY ONE of the three forages below and indicate if its regrowth response will be more like the regrowth response of bahiagrass, more like peanut, or more like elephantgrass and why.bermudagrass, crimson clover, guineagrass

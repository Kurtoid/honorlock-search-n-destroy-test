Select one of the following options. One-page answers are not acceptable, this is not twitter, we are looking to see that you can provide a comprehensive answer to the questions. Make sure to address all components of the question and whenever possible define your terms and discuss one or two theorists.   Explain the fundamental differences between the three major theories in Sociology. Explain each theoretical paradigm and then explain how they compare and contrast with each other. Which theories would likely focus on qualitative methods? (Define qualitative vs quantitative methods) Which of the theories would take a micro approach to studying the social world and which would focus on macro social issues?     The idea of Symbolic Interaction (SI) emerged in the tradition of "Social Psychology". Its goal was to help explain individual behavior in the social context. Early work of James Baldwin (1861-1934) noted that children learn behavior through imitation. Although it sounds like common sense now, he noted that people have "self-consciousness". Later other researchers noted that humans communicate via symbols and interpretations. First, describe or define 2 major concepts in the Symbolic Interaction perspective. George Herbert Mead noted that we go through a process of becoming the self. Describe that process. For Mead what is the difference between the I and the Me and which one would most likely be deviant and do something like run naked on a beach. Between the I & Me which one would never do that and why? In Meads development of the self, explain the importance of socialization, significant others, games, play and imitation     Social conflict theory is a major paradigm in the discipline. The major proponent of conflict theory Is Karl Marx. He said that the history of society involves class struggles. What does he mean by this and who are the classes he identified? Explain Marx's theory of the social world and explain his ideas of false consciousness, and revolution. How would a typical Marxist explain poverty and social problems like homelessness. What is Marx's major problem with the system of capitalism and what does he think is the role of religion in maintaining the system.     Explain Functionalists Robert Merton's Strain Theory of deviance. He said that deviance is linked to social structure, what did Merton mean by this and what was the strain he talked about? What categories did he develop to explain different types of deviant behavior? Define and give examples of each category. Where would the Unabomber fit on Merton's typology? (He was the guy who lived in the woods and sent bombs to people in the community.) What does Merton mean by anomie? Does he use it differently than Durkheim, or other theorist? How could understanding Merton's Strain theory help people in law enforcement or other social service professions. ?

Consider the following diagram of a Central Pattern Generator.  C and D represent motor neurons. [1] CPGs contains only excitatory connections between neurons, not inhibitory. [2] When you stimulate neuron A, neuron B should also fire. [3] C and D should never be firing at the same time. [4] The alternating, rhythmic nature of the resultant behavior is primarily due to neurons E&F  [5] If you destroyed neurons E and F, the muscles controlled by C and D would be unable to contract.

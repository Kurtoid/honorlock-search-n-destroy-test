The costs to produce a bulb (based on capacity operation of 3,000,000 bulbs per year) are as follows:    Direct materials $0.10   Direct labor 0.05   Variable manufacturing overhead 0.01   Fixed manufacturing overhead 0.03   Total $0.19    Fixed manufacturing overhead includes $60,000 of depreciation on equipment for which there is no alternative use and no external market value. The balance of the fixed manufacturing overhead pertains to the salary of the production supervisor who has a lifetime employment contract.

Polymer B is generated from Polymer A by carrying out a post-polymerization reaction.  If the functional groups added to A were uniformly distributed to each polymer chain, B would have the same polydispersity as A.  On the other hand, if the functional group reacted with only some of the A molecules, the polydispersity would change.  If the polydispersity of A is 1.22, determine which of these two possibilities has occurred using the following data for Polymer B:    Molecular weight of x-mer Weight fraction of x-mer   65,000 0.30   125,000 0.40   155,000 0.30

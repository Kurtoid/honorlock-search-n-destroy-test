PLEASE READ:  Here, again, is the link to the Desmos scientific calculator. If an equation doesn't show up correctly, write down the problem as best you can and solve it. I'll view your Honorlock session to see what you experienced, then will grade on how you solved the problem you wrote down. If an image is broken, note that on your paper and skip the problem. I'll view your Honorlock session to verify, then set up a meeting with you to work the problem. When simplifying expressions, you do not have to expand products of polynomials. For example, (7x9 + 3)2  can be left as-is. DO:  Collect and simplify like terms Multiply coefficients or variable expressions with the same base (for example, simplify x5 * x3 to x8). You can leave in negative and fractional exponents unless otherwise indicated in a problem.
STATISTICS A trucking company wants to predict the annual maintenance expense for a truck (Y) using the number of miles driven during the year (X1) and the age of the truck (X2, in years) at the beginning of the year.  The company has gathers historic data on its trucks and expenses and generated the following regression output.   When testing the individual significance of age of truck in the Model, what is the test conclusion at a 10% significance level (i.e. alpha = 0.1)?

Problem 5  In this problem you will implement the flow chart below in Verilog/System Verilog  a) First write Verilog or System Verilog code for a 2:1 multiplexer module where the inputs and outputs that are 3 bits wide, reference 1 bit version in cheat sheet. b) Now implement the flow chart shown with three instances of the 2:1 multiplexer that you wrote in (a). Use good organization. Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables. Do not use compiler directives. Your work should be typed into the window provided, you can drag the bottom right hand corner to make the window bigger, you cannot use the tab key

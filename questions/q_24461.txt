Extra Credit Problem. This problem is optional, and will be used to replace your score on one problem of Test 1 or Test 2.  A circular disk (Body 3) of radius R = 6 inches rolls without slipping on a horizontal surface at contact point D. Link 2 is pinned to Body 3 at point C on the rim of the disk while the other end is pinned to Body 1 at point B. Finally, Body 1 is pinned to ground at location A, and turns at the constant rate of 10 rad/s clockwise. It is known that for the position shown, w2 = 25 rad/s ccw and w3 = 23.33 rad/s cw.  Find the angular accelerations of bodies 2 and 3 in magnitude and direction for the position shown. Concentrate on setting up the equations. If you have trouble with the geometry, you can estimate any distances that you need using the scaled drawing.

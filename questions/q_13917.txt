Please note, when a question has checkboxes for the answer choices, more than one answer may be selected. Please select all answers that apply to the question.  Nothing in the phrasing of the questions, or the appearance of the checkboxes, is intended to imply a number of answers. On multiple answer questions, the answer "None of the other answers is a correct answer to the question" is meant to be exclusive. Due to how multiple answer questions work on Canvas, it does not prevent you from choosing other answers when you select this answer, so please be sure to choose only this option if you feel that is the correct answer to a question. If you choose other answers in addition to "None of the other answers is a correct answer to the question", you will lose points on the question and they will not be returned. Also, please note, there is a known bug in Canvas where if the answer to a "Fill in the blank with a numeric answer" question is 0, Canvas incorrectly reports it as not having been answered. If you believe the answer to a numeric question is 0 and you enter that, do not be alarmed if Canvas tells you you have not answered that question, your 0 answer will have been stored!

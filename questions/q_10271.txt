In 2000, Ahmad owned a large parcel of undeveloped land. He built a house on the east side of the property. Although he could access a country road easily on the eastern border of the property, he constructed a gravel road across the parcel to access the main highway on the western side of the property. He used the gravel road regularly. In 2002, he divided the parcel into two lots. His house was located on Lot #1, and the part of the gravel road with access to the main highway was located on Lot #2. He then sold Lot #1 to Bob and Lot #2 to Cindy. Bob used the gravel road over Lot #2 to access the main highway from his property, just as Ahmad had done. Cindy routinely waived and said hello when Bob drove by her newly built house on Lot #2. Bob regularly used the gravel road for ten years. Then Cindy decided that she would like to farm the property. She told Bob he could no longer use the road or otherwise cross her property to access the main highway. The statute for prescription is seven years in this jurisdiction.

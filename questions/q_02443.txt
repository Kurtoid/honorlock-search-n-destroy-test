Consider the subgroup H={(1),(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23)}{"version":"1.1","math":"( H= {(1), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23) })"} in the Alternating Group, A4{"version":"1.1","math":"(A_4)"}. Determine whether or not (with justification) H is a normal subgroup of A4{"version":"1.1","math":"(A_4)"}. For your assistance, here is the Cayley table for A4{"version":"1.1","math":"(A_4)"}.

Problem 2 Counters count clock cycles Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner.  The tool bar has indent functions.  This is a generic counter design, of course there are other ways to make a counter (may require some modification for this problem). Make a counter module that counts from 0 up to MaxVal and then goes back to 0 and continues to count. You will need clk, reset inputs, and outputs the current count, and carry which is True when count == MaxVal. Use a parameter Size to set the size of array count and the output of the MUX. Use a default parameter Size of 3. Use System Verilog, always_ff, and always_comb, and don't use reg datatype. (hint: see cheat sheet) A) First write a 2:1 multiplexer module (use parameter Size to set the width of inputs A, B, and output F. B) Write a D flipflop register (REG in the figure above) to hold the current count. Use parameter Size to set the width of D, and Q, and Q'. C) Write a module instantiating the multiplexer, and register with additional components/logic necessary to count 0-MaxVal and then go back to 0 and continue counting back to MaxVal ... and so on. Use parameter Size to set the width of Count, and MaxVal. Don't forget the carry output. Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables. Do not use compiler directives.

Review each case and indicate the correct code.    Preoperative and postoperative diagnosis: Bilateral breast hypoplasia and symmetry Operation performed: Bilateral augmentation mammoplasty The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, and then general anesthesia was achieved. Local infiltration with 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,00 dilution of epinephrine was performed. On the right breast, using a #15 blade, an inframammary incision was made and carried through the skin and subcutaneous issue. A Bovie electrocautery dissection was completed down to the pectoralis muscle, and a submuscular pocket was created. Saline was used to irrigate the site. Hemostasis was achieved. The same procedure then was completed on the left breast, with dissection performed in a symmetric fashion to recreate a submuscular pocket. Two implants were inspected, and they were placed in the submuscular pockets. Additional dissection was performed on the left side to achieve symmetry. 3-0 Vicryl sutures were used to close the muscle layer. The subcutaneous deep dermal layer was then closed with 3-0 Vicryl sutures and the subcuticular with 4-0 Vicryl sutures. The wounds were dressed, and a Velcro breast band was placed on the superior aspect of the breast. After extubating the patient, she was sent to recovery in stable condition.

Two solutions, initially at 24.60degC, are mixed in a coffee cup calorimeter (Ccal = 15.5 J/degC). When a 100.0 mL volume of 0.100 M AgNO3 solution is mixed with a 100.0 mL sample of 0.200 M NaCl solution, the temperature in the calorimeter rises to 25.30degC. Determine the DHdegrxn for the reaction as written below. Assume that the density and heat capacity of the solutions is the same as that of water.  NaCl(aq) + AgNO3(aq) - AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq) DHdegrxn = ?

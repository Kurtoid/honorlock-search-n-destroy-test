Citrate lyase catalyzes the reaction shown below, a key step in generating cytosolic acetyl-CoA for fatty acid biosynthesis.  While we did not discuss this specific reaction in lecture, it is analogous to others we did cover in detail.  Choose the correct structures to describe the chemical mechanism of citrate lyase.  Note that some anions have lost the "-" signs due to translation into Canvas.  Ignore these missing signs when choosing the correct answer.

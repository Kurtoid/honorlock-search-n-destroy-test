Use the following information about a research study to answer the questions below. Purpose of the study: To examine some of the factors that inhibit witnesses from helping someone in distress (bystander apathy). Nature of the study: The researchers observed the helping behaviors of subway passengers in response to a series of staged crises in which a confederate acting as a victim with a cane collapses on a crowded train. The confederate appeared to be bleeding from the mouth after falling- indicating a potentially dangerous situation, on some occasions. On other occasions, the confederate did not appear to be bleeding- indicating a non-dangerous situation. Hypothesis:  As the perceived cost for helping increases, bystanders are less likely to offer direct help and more likely to provide indirect help or leave the scene. The observation of an emergency is an emotionally aversive situation that an observer will attempt to terminate through direct help, indirect help (notifying others) or leaving the scene. Whether a bystander will offer direct help is determined by how costly (dangerous) the bystander believes the situation to be. Findings: Passengers were less likely to help the bleeding victim irrespective of how many other bystanders were present. This supports the hypothesis that the perceived danger of the situation (rather than the number of other witnesses present) determines helping behavior.   1. The Belmont Report (1978) indicates that "respect for persons incorporates at least two ethical convictions: first, that individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and second, that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection. The principle of respect for persons thus divides into two separate moral requirements: the requirement to acknowledge autonomy and the requirement to protect those with diminished autonomy". Was the autonomy (the right to self-determination) of research participants jeopardized in this study? Why or why not? Use the APA ethics code and empirical literature to support your answer.   2. The Belmont Report (1978) also indicates that"respect for persons requires that subjects, to the degree that they are capable, be given the opportunity to choose what shall or shall not happen to them. This opportunity is provided when adequate standards for informed consent are satisfied". The consent process can be analyzed as containing three elements: information, comprehension, and voluntariness". Is informed consent necessary for naturalistic studies conducted in public settings? Were the participants' privacy violated? Could the hypothesis have been validly tested without using a deceptive research design? Are there ways to respect participant autonomy and privacy and still use deception? Use the APA ethics code and relevant literature to support your answer.

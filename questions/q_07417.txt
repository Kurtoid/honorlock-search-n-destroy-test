Your childhood friend, Sally, just inherited a dormant strawberry farm from her grandmother. Sally's goal is to plant the best tasting organic strawberry in the Tampa area. She wants to compare three types of strawberries (i.e., Sweet Charlies, Stargazer Perennials, and Seascape Delights) and two types of organic food (i.e., 50% bone meal and 100% bone meal). She knows that you are at UF and taking Research Methods so she asks you to design a study, compute the statistical analyses, and interpret the findings in determining the best tasting organic strawberry for her farm.       A. List the necessary steps involved in conducting this study including the experimental design. B. Do as complete statistical analysis as possible, and label your work.

You have evaluated the building of a new distribution center for Amazon. The distribution warehouse center in Utah as originally presented has an initial cost of $200 million with an NPV of $10 million. The facility will total 800,000 square feet and will be filled with robots to speed up the distribution process. Given the past year you are also looking at the benefits of building the facility for expansion to handle the possibility of exceptional demand. There is a 70% probability that the space will not be needed but there is a 30% probability that additional capacity will be needed to handle a significant increase in revenues for this area. It will require an additional $25 million be spent up front. If the expenditure is not made on the front-end there is no way to expand the facility later when the actual need is known. With the expansion capability the distribution center has an NPV of $15 million. What is the value of the real option to expand in millions of dollars?

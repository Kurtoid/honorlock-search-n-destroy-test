Two cylindrical rods, made of materials A and B, are placed end-to-end as shown in the figure.  Each rod is 240 cm in length with a radius of 8 cm. The top and bottom surfaces are insulated. A heat source and a heat sink is placed at either ends of the rod. The source generates energy at a rate of 625 W. You may assume all of this energy is conducted through the rod. At steady state, the temperature distribution in the rods are measured via 8 thermocouples. The temperatures obtained is tabulated below.    Material  x (cm) Temperature (K)   A 50 762.5   100 700   150 637.5   200 575   B 300 464   350 434   400 404   450 374    Based on the data provided, answer the following questions. Upload all your clearly written work.  Determine the temperature at the interface in material A and in material B. (Hint: Plot the temperature vs. x) What is the thermal contact resistance at the interface? Determine the thermal conductivities of the two materials.

Imagine you are studying dimple frequency in different human populations. For this particular study, you are interested in the populations of India and Mauritius island. This trait is defined by two alleles, E1 and E2. Let's imagine allele E1 has a frequency of 0.3 on the island of Mauritius and a frequency of 0.8 in the continent (India). You initially collected data for 1000 individuals. In five years, you go back and identified that additional 300 individuals migrated from India to Mauritius island (Now, your N = 1300). What would be the frequency of E1 on the island in the next generation? Use the One-Island Model. Round up and estimate to four decimal points (the system is very sensitive, so please estimate the numbers correctly). p'1 = (1 - m)(pI) + (m)(pc)

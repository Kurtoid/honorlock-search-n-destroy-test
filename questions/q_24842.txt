A 38-year-old male who recently completed radiation treatment and chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma presents to an urgent care clinic with complaints of severe fatigue, shortness of breath and bruising. The following results are reported from a complete blood count: WBC: 2200 cells/ml3 Hgb: 6.2 g/dL Hct: 18.4% Platelet: 76,200  plt/uL What actions are indicated to address physical and laboratory findings?

A researcher wishes to estimate the population of blue whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  His team "captures" and "tags" 22 different blue whales in late June.  Six blue whales are found to have tagged of the 10 different blue whales spotted three weeks later.   Note: In this study, blue whales are "captured" via a photograph and are "tagged" by identifying the unique markings on their fluke. a.  Based on these figures, estimate the population of blue whales in this region.  Show all work and round your final answer to the nearest whole number. b.  Extra Credit - 2 points  If it is the case that certain blue whales are more likely to be "tagged" than others, would the method outlined above underestimate or overestimate the size of the population?  Explain.

When designing special groups in your classroom Evertson and Emmer (2013) recommend using the following data sources:
Figure 1(a) shows a circuit containing a random logic which is implemented using built-in self-testing (BIST) circuits. The system clock rate is 3GHz, and STUMPS BIST design is used. Assume the random logic contains 30 scan chains for BIST, 12 of them contain 90 scan cells in each scan chain, and 18 of them contain 100 scan cells in each scan chain. Assume the shift speed is 200MHz, and 45000 random test patterns are required to detect most of the single stuck-at faults.    (a) What is the test time required using the BIST design given above. Note that the time required for scanning in the seeds and scanning out the signature for PRSR and MISR must be considered. (b) If test per clock (i.e., a test is performed for each test clock) is used for this STUMPS BIST architecture, what problem will occur? (c) If the circuit under test contains many more OR gates than AND gates, what can be done to increase the random pattern fault coverage? (d) Figure 1(b) shows a scannable flip-flop in Fig. 1(a) with reset (i.e., when R = 1, the flip-flop will be reset to logic 0). SE in Figure 1(b) represents the scan enable signal.  When the reset circuit is tested (for single stuck-at faults), what problem may occur?

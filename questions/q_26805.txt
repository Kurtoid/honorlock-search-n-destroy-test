Now imagine that you've graduated and established your career as a leader in animal agriculture.  Since graduating, predicted climate change has occurred and the world population has grown even greater than anticipated.  This has put substantial pressure upon the existing food supply chain and dictated that the end goals be changed.  In this scenario, maximizing feed efficiency has become the driving consideration when determining the optimal harvest point. Below depicts a curve illustrating where animals a currently harvested (C). Given that FE would be the new driver determining harvest, when would you harvest your animals? For full credit be sure to explain the biology of the growth curve and how it influences this decision (don't write a book though).

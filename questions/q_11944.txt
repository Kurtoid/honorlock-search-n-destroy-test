1) (25 pts) A square metal plate is subjected to a proportional bi-axial loading as shown below.  The edge is 60 mm, and the thickness is 5mm.  Two strain gauges are placed at the center of the plate to measure the strain component e11 and e22. a) If the material is a polycrystalline metal with homogeneous grain structure, the horizontal load P11 = 50 KN, and the vertical load P22 = 20 KN. The readings from the two gauges are e11 = 3.5 X 10-3 and e22 = 1 X 10-3, respectively. Please determine (1) the Young's modulus E, (2) Poisson's ratio n, and (3) through-thickness strain e33. b) If the material is a cubic single crystal with the loading lined up along unit cell axis, please describe how you can determine all the compliance components through the experiment. Your description needs to be in detail, including listing all the compliance components to be determine, and the experimental method.

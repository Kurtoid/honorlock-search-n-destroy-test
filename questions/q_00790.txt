Los garifunas Lee el texto sobre los garifunas y determina si las oraciones son ciertas o falsas. En 1635, un barco de esclavos venia hacia el Nuevo Mundo cuando naufrago (shipwrecked) cerca de la isla de San Vicente en el mar Caribe. Los sobrevivientes llegaron hasta una isla donde vivieron con los indigenas caribe (Caribs) y formaron una nueva comunidad en libertad. Asi nacieron "los negros caribe" (Black Caribs), tambien conocidos como "los garifunas".  Despues de una guerra (war), tanto Inglaterra (England) como Francia reclamaban la isla de San Vicente como suya. En 1783, Inglaterra y Francia firmaron el Tratado (Treaty) de Paris bajo el cual San Vicente paso a manos inglesas. En marzo de 1797, los ingleses deportaron a 5.080 garifunas y el 12 de abril de 1797 llegaron a la isla de Roatan, hoy en dia parte de Honduras. Al tiempo, los garifunas empezaron a extenderse por la costa caribena de America Central. Hoy en dia, hay comunidades garifunas en Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala y Belice. Mantienen muchos elementos de sus raices (roots) africanas, como la musica y el baile. La comunidad garifuna mas grande fuera de America Central se encuentra en Nueva York, donde se estima que viven unos 200.000 garifunas.   [1] La cultura garifuna fue formada por africanos e indigenas caribes.   [2] El Tratado de Paris fue firmado en 1783.   [3]Los garifunas fueron deportados de San Vicente por los franceses.   [4] Los garifunas fueron esclavizados (enslaved) en Honduras.   [5] Hay mas garifunas en Nueva York que en America Central.
On Monday news reached us that the French* had printed a proclamation in Arabic and had sent it around to be read in public, calling upon Egyptians to obey them. A copy of that document came into my possession and I will quote it here: 'In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate. On behalf of the French Republic which is based upon the foundations of liberty and equality, General Bonaparte addresses all Egyptian people: O ye Egyptians, some may tell you that we have come here to abolish your religion, but that is a lie. The real purpose of our campaign is to restore your rights from your oppressors--the Mamluk** rulers of Egypt. Know that all people are equal and that only differences in the degree of reason, virtue, or knowledge may be used to elevate one person above another. But what reason, virtue, or knowledge do the Mamluks have that gives them the right to claim the most fertile land, the most desirable dwellings, and the highest government positions in Egypt? None whatsoever.' In that proclamation, their statement 'In the name of Allah, etc.' suggests that they agree with Islam. But in reality they are opposed to both Christianity and Islam and do not hold fast to any religion. They are materialists who deny the Hereafter and Resurrection, and who reject Prophethood and religious Messengership. In politics, too, they do not have a single ruler, like other countries, who can speak on their behalf. *In 1798 a French army led by Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt in an attempt to threaten Great Britain's access to its colonial empire in India. **the ruling class in Egypt at the time, mostly made up of non-Egyptians --Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti, Egyptian religious scholar and resident of Cairo, eyewitness chronicle of the French occupation of Egypt, 1798-1801 The outcome of the French invasion of Egypt was

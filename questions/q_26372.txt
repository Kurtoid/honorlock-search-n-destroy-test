Note: FRQ 1 has three parts: Part (a), Part (b), and Part (c). Show your work. In this section you answer Part (C).  [FRQ1 PART (C) - The information below was copied and pasted from Part (A)] Etude Corp. began operations in 2020. The company sometimes sells used warehouses on an installment basis. In those cases, Etude reports income in its income statement in the year of the sale. In its income tax return, though, Etude reports installment income by the installment method. Installment income in 2020 was $90,000, which Etude expects to collect equally over the next three years.  Etude's first year of operations also led to an accrued loss of $100,000 for financial reporting purposes because of pending litigation. This amount is not tax-deductible until the period the loss is realized, which the company estimates to be next year. The tax rate is 30%, but based on an enacted law, is scheduled to become 35% in 2021. Etude's pretax accounting income from the 2020 income statement was $830,000, which includes $40,000 of interest revenue from an investment in municipal bonds. There were no differences between accounting income and taxable income other than those described above.    [REQUIRED] Assuming that in 2021 Etude's pre-tax financial income is $650,000, no other temporary or permanent differences are created, and reversals of previously created temporary differences are as planned, what journal entry would Etude record at the end of 2021?

Diagram the following argument.  Use a sheet of paper and submit to dropbox asap if needed: Because 1 robots can stage attacks with little immediate risk to the people who operate them, 2 opponents say that robot warriors lower the barriers to warfare, 3 potentially making nations more trigger-happy and 4 leading to a new technological arms race. 5 "Wars will be started very easily and with minimal costs" as automation increases, predicted Wendell Wallach, a scholar at the Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics and chairman of its technology and ethics study group.

Given the following images and the following applied cutoff frequencies:  .61/cm .41/cm .21/cm Which cutoff frequency is indicated by the letter A?

(i) How do AB toxins activate ERAD?  (ii) How do these toxins avoid being degraded by the ERAD system?
At one time, it was proposed that a total dislocation in a face centered cubic (FCC) can be decomposed into two asymmetric partial dislocations.  Points A, B, and C are the lattice points on the slip plane.  d lies in the center of line BC.   (a) If AB, BC, and AC represent the Burgers vectors of three total dislocations in this plane, please identify AB, BC, and AC with their proper Burgers vector expressed in the vector notation.  Note Burgers vector notation represents both direction and magnitude. (b) If Ad, dB, and dC represent the Burgers vectors of partial dislocations in this plane, please identify Ad, dB, and dC with their proper Burgers vector expressed in the vector notation. Note Burgers vector notation represents both direction and magnitude. (c) Please demonstrate AB=Ad+dB using Burger's vector calculation. (d) Please use the vector energy calculation and notations to determine whether this dislocation decomposition AB -> Ad+dB is energy favorable or not.

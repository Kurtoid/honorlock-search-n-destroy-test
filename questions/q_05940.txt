A piece of Silicon is doped with 2 x   1016 donor atoms/cm3  at 300K.  A laser with photon energies greater than Eg shines on the entire piece generating 1021 EHPs/cm3 per second The electron and hole lifetime are both 10-5 s. Using the letters on figure below, which energy levels represent the Fermi level with no light and the quasi-Fermi levels (QFL) when the laser illuminates the Si sample? Answer should be in this format:  n, m l ; where n is FL without light, m is QFL of electrons and l is QFL OF holes.
Applied Mineral Identification: A friend returns from a recent trip with a mineral they have found and asks you to identify it because you are taking Earth Science this semester.  They describe the sample as glassy and transparent.  This property you have seen associated with calcite, halite, gypsum and quartz in class.  You have access to tool kits in the lab to help you identify the unknown mineral and tell your friend to bring the sample in for further testing.

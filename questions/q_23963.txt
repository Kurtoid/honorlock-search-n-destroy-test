Innovation Products International (IPI) is a health foods company which recently discovered that increased soy isoflavones (at least 500 mg every 2 days) in a person's diet has been able to extend a person's life span by at least 20 years.  The company developed a new product called "Soy for Life" which is a tasty breakfast bar that contains 500 mg of soy isoflavones in each bar.  Cost of research and development for the product was $2,500,000.  The breakfast bar market size is currently measured at 100 million units of which IPI serves 45%. Initial taste tests concluded that consumers are unable to make any taste distinctions between a regular breakfast bar and one that contains 500 mg of isoflavones. IPI plans to launch this new breakfast bar initially across the United States using its current distribution channel of supermarket chains and health food stores which have 5,000 locations combined.  The company then plans to expand the product market area to include South America, Europe and Asia and also intends to setup manufacturing plants in these expanded market areas.  Innovation Product International's fixed cost is currently at $1 million per year with the total cost to produce each breakfast bar at $1.45.  The finding of several research studies has determined that consumers would be willing to pay $11.25 for "Soy for Life" breakfast at which the retail selling price would be targeted.

Integrative 2 Rainey, a Chicago native, is a big fan of major league baseball.  She regularly attends home games of her beloved Cubs, but also loves to watch reruns of classic games on cable sports channels.  Rainey realizes that watching old games on TV is fairly unusual, but wonders whether more people are watching classic games due to the COVID-19 pandemic, when no live baseball games are being played. Rainey surveys a sample of 38 baseball fans.  They report they are currently watching a mean of 7.6 hours of classic baseball games per week, with a standard deviation of 3.8.  From viewer survey records kept by a major cable sports network, Rainey finds out that the average number of hours per week watched from a population of baseball fans is mu = 5.2. Test whether the COVID-19 pandemic is linked to a significant increase in the number of hours fans watch classic games.  Use an alpha of .05. a.  Name the specific inferential test that is appropriate for this study. b.  Conduct a hypothesis test.  Be sure to include (1) your hypotheses; (2) your critical test statistic value(s); (3) your observed test statistic; (4) your decision regarding the null hypothesis; and (5) your conclusion, stated in non-statistical terms.

Severn Industries is considering making an investment into a new drug program called MARVELDRUG.  MARVELDRUG requires an initial (first-stage) investment of $20 million at t = 0.  The first-stage investment will produce positive cash flows of $6.0 million at the end of each of the next four years (t = 1, 2, 3, and 4). If the company proceeds with this first-stage investment today, it will have the option to invest in the second stage of the project at t = 4  The value of the second-stage investment depends critically on whether the project receives FDA approval.  Currently, the company estimates that there is a 30% chance that the project will receive FDA approval and a 70% chance the project will not receive FDA approval.  If the project receives FDA approval, the net present value of the second-stage investment (as of t = 4) is +$34.0687 million.  If the project does not receive FDA approval, the net present value of the second-stage investment (at t = 4) is -$50.5 million. Consider the following assumptions: -All cash flows are discounted at 10%. -Severn Industries cannot make the second-stage investment without previously doing the first-stage investment. -Severn Industries is not obligated to make the second-stage investment. What is the overall expected net present value of MARVELDRUG (as of t = 0)?  Note this calculation should take into account the option to invest in the second-stage project.

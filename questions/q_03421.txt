Which of the following would be considered a main transition in this paragraph?       Finally, large state universities might be a place where fewer members of a student's time-tested support network are to be found, compared to if that student had enrolled in the local community college. As high school adolescents transition into young adulthood, they face issues they have never encountered before as they start living increasingly independent lives. True, there are Facebook and Skype to make connections with high school friends and family in order to keep in touch, but it is not the same as being in their presence. And sometimes it's when we are far from home when a serious problem arises, like the flat tire on the freeway in a city where no one knows you or suddenly finding the bank account is barren. Quite differently, attending community college the first few years in the cozy familiarity of one's comfort zone, with family and friends cheering from the sidelines and then at the gymnasium at graduation, can provide a psychological backdrop of security, helping students to focus on their studies. Many students needlessly suffer their first year of studies far away from home in an unfamiliar setting, feeling tremendous isolation. That cannot be productive to achieving a high grade point average. Getting a bachelor's degree takes most full-time students four or five years, and often they get derailed in the first semester or two, especially when far from home. If students would think about putting themselves in the very best position to succeed right out of the gate on Day One at college, keeping their support network close at hand, made all the easier by beginning the college experience at a local community college, can pay huge dividends.

Introduction In this problem, you must demonstrate the entire circuit design process.  Your answer must include: 1.) a truth table, drawn digitally 2.) a k-map, drawn digitally 3.) a simplified output expression, based on your k-map Problem Statement Design a circuit with four inputs, D,C, B, and A where A is the MSB.  The output does not matter when the binary value of ABCD is greater than 00112 and less than 10102. The output should be low when the binary value of ABCD is equal to 210, 310, 1010, or 1110.  All other remaining outputs should be high.

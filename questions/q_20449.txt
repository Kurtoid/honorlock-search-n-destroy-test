Madelyn has created a methodology that employs a computer-implemented mathematical algorithm to determine the likelihood that an engaged couple will stay married for more than 20 years. The invention takes as inputs certain vital statistics and measurements such as blood types, average heart rates and the presence and interaction of certain genetic markers between the couple to determine at the 90% confidence level whether they will still be married in 20 years. Madelyn has just received a patent on the methodology.  Tashina--who has been employing a methodology that is virtually identical to Madelyn's--is the subject of a patent infringement lawsuit from Madelyn. What is Tashina's best defense?

A seafood importer entered into a written agreement with a restaurant chain to sell the restaurant chain 500 pounds of prawns for a total price of $10,000. Prior to the date set for execution of the contract, the market price for prawns soared because of a natural disaster in an area where a large percentage of prawns are cultivated. The importer informed the restaurant chain that the cost of prawns had risen and requested that the contract price be adjusted to $12,000 for the 500 pounds of prawns as a result. The restaurant chain agreed orally to pay the $12,000, but no written confirmation was exchanged between the parties. Shortly thereafter, the market for prawns stabilized and prawns became available again at predisaster price levels. The importer shipped 500 pounds of prawns to the restaurant chain. On receipt, the restaurant chain sent the importer a certified check in the amount of $10,000, marking it "payment in full." The importer did not cash the check, but telephoned the restaurant chain demanding an additional $2,000. The restaurant chain refuses to pay the additional sum. May the importer enforce its demand for an additional $2,000 in a court of law?

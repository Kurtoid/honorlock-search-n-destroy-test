A Florida real estate agent assisted a client from Minnesota buy some land in Florida. The contract between them stipulated that the real estate agent was a "buyer's" agent, who would be paid a fixed amount of money if/when the client agreed to purchase land in Florida. After signing the contract, the two corresponded regularly through the mail while they were working on the deal. After three months of searching, the agent identified the perfect beachfront home in Naples, Florida, and the client closed the deal. Unfortunately, however, the client refused to pay the agent's fee after closing, and the agent filed a breach of contract suit against the client in Florida state court, sending notice by certified mail to the client's mailing address through which they had previously corresponded. After the mail was returned to the agent marked "undelivered," the agent published notice of the suit in a local Florida newspaper as is permitted by Florida law. The client never learned of the case, failed to appear, and the court entered a default judgment in favor of the agent. When the agent attempted to execute the default judgment in Minnesota, the client collaterally attacked the judgment by arguing that notice in Florida case was constitutionally defective. Which of the following would be an appropriate decision of the Minnesota court with respect to the client's challenge?

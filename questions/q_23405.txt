Long odds After discovering the bent-tail mutation in mice, the researchers decided to test a hypothesis about the genetic basis of the trait. Because they reasoned that the trait was sex-linked, they decided to mate a male (B-) with a bent tail to a heterozygous female (Bb). The offspring from this cross were 7 females and 8 males. All of the females had bent tails, but only three of the males had bent tails. The researchers used a Punnett square, like the one below, to calculate the expected ratios of phenotypes for males and females. Then, they used a Chi-squared test to infer whether the observed ratios were significantly different from the expected ratios; the P values corresponding to a particular value of X2 is shown in the table below.                                           Father's alleles     Mother's alleles     B     ----       B                   b                        Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 31-35.   31.

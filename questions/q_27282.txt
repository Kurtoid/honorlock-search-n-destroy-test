EARTH UNIVERSITY [A] For many universities around the world, the college experience has become more environmentally friendly, from recycling to renewable energy use, to biking to class. But at EARTH University in eastern Costa Rica, it's the main focus of study.[B] "We're forming leaders to go out and influence their communities and their countries to take greater care of the Earth and change the world," said Jose Zaglul, the university's president. That may seem like a lofty mission for a small college of 417 students in a remote area. But the university is well-known for its excellent teaching methods and facilities.[C] The university has its own rain forest area and organic farm, so students can learn how their planet works while on campus. "It's as if on the first day of medical school, you go [and work in] the emergency room," university president Zaglul said. "You may not know the science yet, but [as a student] you're exposed to the environment from day one. Once you go back to the classroom, things make more sense."[D] The school's organic farm produces vegetables for the school cafeteria and local communities. It also produces food for pigs, cows, and chickens, and it raises a local fish called guapote. Panfilo Tabora, an EARTH University professor who heads the farm, says it was one of the first "teaching" organic farms. "All students have to come here and put in their shift, to question and compare things, innovate, and then implement what they have learned," Tabora said.What is the best title for the reading?

A crank arm consists of a solid segment of length b1 = 80-mm and diameter d = 25-mm, a segment of length b2 = 140-mm and segment of length b3 = 40-mm as shown in the figure. Two loads P act as shown, one parallel to -x and another parallel to -y. Each loads P equals to 1.5-kN.

Since you have a bit of extra time on this exam, this bonus question will be free response. Your answers should be brief but thorough. You have an enzymatic pathway that catalyzes the synthesis of a product "C"                               E1                       E2                                                                  A          [?][?]      B      [?][?]       C       Enzyme 1 (E1) uses substrate A to catalyze the formation of product B, which is needed to make the final product of the pathway, product C. If there is an excess of product C, feedback inhibition can be used to make sure that cellular resources are not being wasted.  a. Explain in one sentence how feedback inhibition works. Explain how product C, acting as an inhibitor, could affect the activity of enzyme 1 (E1), and the events that would follow in each type of inhibition: b. competitive inhibition  c. non-competitive inhibition

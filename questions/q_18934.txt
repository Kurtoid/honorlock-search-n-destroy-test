In January, an independent contractor from State A had a contract with a moving company from State B to develop a mobile phone app that would allow the company's customers to reserve and book a move. The contractor immediately began work on the app, devoting at least half of her workday to the app. In March of the same year, the moving company decided that the app would not increase business that much, so it told the contractor to stop work and further refused to pay the contractor for the time she already spent on the app. The contractor claims that she would have billed the moving company $76,000 for the work she has done so far. The applicable statute of limitations for a breach of contract action is two years. Coincidentally, in April of the same year, the contractor was injured when one of the moving company's trucks rear- ended her while she was stopped at a red light, causing the contractor considerable damages. The applicable statute of limitations for tort actions is one year. As a result of the accident, the contractor suffered $25,000 in damages. In August of the following year, the contractor properly filed a diversity action for breach of contract. One week thereafter, before the moving company responded to the complaint, the contractor amended her complaint to add a cause of action for the tort claim. If the moving company moves to dismiss the tort claim, should the court grant the motion?

Instructions: Read. Then choose the correct answers.     Losing Weight I want to lose weight. I plan to go on a special diet. My doctor suggests either a high-fiber or a high-protein diet, so I made two menus to try.My High-Fiber DietBreakfast: One bowl of breakfast cereal (such as wholegrain cereal, but nothing with too much sugar), or a wholewheat bagel and some fresh fruit.Lunch or Dinner: Green vegetables, bean or lentil soup (I like lentils!), and some berries or nuts.Snack: Popcorn or dried fruit (I don't really like popcorn, so fruit is better.).My High-Protein DietBreakfast: Three sausages, two eggs, and a glass of milk.Lunch or Dinner: A large steak (I love steak!), and cheese.Snack: A hamburger or hot dog without the bread. (My doctor thinks that too much bread is not good for me.)After two weeks I should see a change. The diet I choose should be easy because many things on my menus are my favorite foods.

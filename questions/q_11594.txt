Three +25 nC charges are arranged as shown below, arranged around a position marked with an "x." One charge is 0.02 m above the x, one is 0.02 m below the x, and one is 0.02 m to the left of the x. Be sure to consider whether your answer for each part of this question should be a vector or a scalar.     Find the electric potential at the x. [4] Find the electric field at the x. [5] If a +5 nC charge with a mass of 0.03 kg is placed at the x and then released, find its initial acceleration at the moment it is released.

David and John are twins who are celebrating their 45th birthdays today (t = 0).  David realizes that he needs to begin saving for retirement.  David's plan is to deposit into an investment account $25,000 annually at the end of each of the next 20 years.  The first deposit will occur one year from now when he turns 46 (t = 1), and the final deposit will be made on his 65th birthday (t = 20).  On the other hand, John is a procrastinator and doesn't plan on beginning saving for retirement until he turns 51.  He will also make his last deposit on his 65th birthday, so he will have made only 15 annual deposits.  Both David and John plan to retire when they make their final deposit on their 65th birthdays.  Both have similar investing styles so they both expect to earn an annual 7% rate of return on their investments.  How much does John need to save annually to have the same amount at retirement that David has?

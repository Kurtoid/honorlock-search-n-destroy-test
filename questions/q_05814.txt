Question 44 (5 points) Ari and Barbara, both high school seniors, hate their Calculus teacher and are doing very badly in the class. They come up with the theory that if their teacher died before the final exam, their high school would probably just give them all a grade of "A" because everyone would feel sorry for them. They decide to give their teacher a poison apple, and they go online and find a way to make a single apple lethally poisonous without changing its appearance or taste (using a combination of chemical cleaners found in many homes). They follow the recipe and present their teacher with the poison apple on Thursday afternoon. She sets the apple down on her desk. That night both girls start to feel terrible. What were they thinking? How could they? They pray that it's not too late and rush over to the school. Security lighting allows them to look in their classroom window and see that the poison apple is still on the teacher's desk. They are determined to get the apple and make sure that it doesn't hurt anyone, but when they try to raise a window to get in the classroom, the school's alarm system goes off. When they are caught by local police, they confess to everything. They are charged with Attempted Murder.   Do Ari and Barbara have a possible defense of abandonment/renunciation under the common law? What about under the Model Penal Code? (See MPC SS 5.01.) Explain why or why not for both.

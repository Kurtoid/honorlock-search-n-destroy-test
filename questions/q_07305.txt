In the processAreas() method, use a loop to go through each object in the arrayList of GeometricShape, and call the polymorphic methods calculateArea() and toString() for each object in the arrayList.  Each object should be printed with all the values in the instance variables, including the area.    public void processAreas() {        //Create a loop to process all the objects in the arrayList of GeometricShape.        //Within the loop:        //  1.) Each object in the arrayList calls its polymorphic method to calculate the area of that shape:        //  2.) Each object in the arrayList calls the toString method and prints all of the object's content and the object's area     }   Here is an example of the output produced by the processAreas() method.

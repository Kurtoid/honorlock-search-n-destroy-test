This is the first of 12 Non-multiple choice question.  YOU MUST DO 7 of these, and no more than that.  If you do more than 7 of them, I will ONLY accept the first 7.  It is up to you to determine which of these 12 questions you can get the most points on, so read all of them before making your decision.  If you start to answer a question and change your mind, make sure that you delete all answers, or I will consider that one of the 7. 1. The following diagram shows possible vertical profiles of various seawater properties as they vary with depth. Figure 24 Identify the curves of seawater temperature, salinity, oxygen content, CO2 content, nutrient content, and density vs. depth in these graphs. Next, explain why each of the following properties (temperature, salinity, oxygen content, carbon dioxide content, and nutrient content) goes up or down as depth increases. Do not JUST say, "It's low because ... in deep water.  Explain why it's HIGH in one place and LOW in another (if it is).  If it's constant, explain why.  I want you to show you understand the processes occurring. You do NOT need to explain why density increases, but put an X in the explanation box to get the free half point of credit (making calculations easier).  Just an X, nothing else.

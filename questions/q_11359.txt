Once you have typed your answer in, you can close the quiz and then should upload a picture of your work to the free-response assignment within 10 minutes of closing the quiz. Key equations and a Periodic Table to be used for the whole quiz are included below:pH = -log[H3O+]pH + pOH = 14[H3O+][OH-]=1.0 x 10-14Kw=1.0 x 10-14pKa=-log(Ka)pKa + pKb=14Free Response 1: A 0.22 M solution of weak acid HB has a pH of 5.0. What is the Ka of this acid? (5 points)Free Response 2: The pyridinium ion, C5H5NH+, has a Ka of 5.6 x 10-6. Determine the pH of a 3.9 M solution of the pyridinium ion. (5 points)Free Response 3: Determine the pH and concentrations of all species present at equilibrium (H2C6H6O6, HC6H6O6-, C6H6O62-, H3O+, and OH-) of a 0.0930 M solution of the diprotic acid H2C6H6O6. . (12 points)Free Response 4: A solution is created by combining 0.25 moles of NH3 with 0.80 moles of NH4+ in 2.0 L of total solution. If the Kb of NH3 is 1.8 x 10-5, determine the pH of this solution. (5 points)Free Response 5: A titration is run between a solution of HX and NaOH. If the Kb of X- is 1.0 x 10-7  and the concentration of both HX and NaOH are 0.026 M before reacting at the equivalence point, determine the pH of this solution at the equivalence point. (5 points)

6.  Disney World's Animal Kingdom is a family theme park in Orlando, Florida. One of its longest rides, "Kilimanjaro Safaris," has a ride time that is normally distributed with a mean of m = 14 minutes and a standard deviation of s = 3 minutes.  If the ride lasts more than 19 minutes, it is considered too long and the manager must decrease the ride time.

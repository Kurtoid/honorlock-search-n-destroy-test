The bar OA in the telescope adjusting mechanism shown below rotates at a constant angular velocity of o=3 rad/sec CCW.  All dimensions shown are in mm.   The instantaneous center of zero velocity of telescope AB at the instant shown is located at point [IC]. The angular velocity of bar AB is [wab] rad/sec and the velocity of point B is vB=[vB] mm/sec. The angular acceleration of bar AB is [aab] rad/sec2 and the acceleration of point B is aB=[aB] mm/sec2.  Important Note: Please use minus (-) sign for your answers to CW angular velocities and accelerations, and linear velocities and accelerations from right to left. Round your answers to 1 decimal place if fractional. Otherwise, enter their integer values.

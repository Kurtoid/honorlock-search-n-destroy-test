Q#37  John Bowlby found that hospitalized children experienced (and communicated) extreme distress when separated from their parents even when their physical needs were met and hospital staff behaved in a kindly manner. He interpreted this as an adaptive response given the dangers of ancient environments.  His focus on the brain-based nature of infant distress led to changes in institutional policy (e.g. hospitals now allow children the comfort of a familiar caretaker when a hospital stay is necessary).  Sarah Blaffer-Hrdy credits Bowlby's with providing "one of the greatest contributions to human well-being ever made by an evolutionary theorist."

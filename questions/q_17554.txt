Question 36 (6 Points) Recall the case of The Queen v. Dudley and Stephens (the cannibalism on the high seas case). Thomas Dudley and Edwin Stephens have both been convicted of murder for killing young Richard Parker. There is no mandatory sentence. The judge can sentence them to anything from probation and community service, to a term of years (0-100 years), to "life" (with parole), to life without parole, to death. Make three separate brief arguments for how the men should be sentenced. The three separate arguments should exemplify the three different philosophical approaches to punishment that we focused on. In particular, make an argument exemplifying each of the following approaches: 1) utilitarianism, 2) positive ("robust") retributivism, and 3) negative retributivism (a.k.a., side-constrained consequentialism). Clearly label your arguments, noting the approach that each exemplifies. The arguments can be very short (2-3 sentences). *You will be evaluated on whether your arguments illustrate these three different philosophical approaches--not on the sentences you recommend or whether the arguments themselves are persuasive. Focus on making sentencing arguments from each of these three perspectives.

Extra credit question (2 points; it shows as 0 points in this exam so that Canvas will not count it in the denominator, I will manually add up to 2 points as appropriate when grading so that it will show as extra credit). Numerous researchers around the world are working to develop vaccines to SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing the current pandemic that is impacting all of our lives. Although there are different approaches being taken, the basic idea is for the vaccine to get the adaptive immune system to produce antibodies (note: there is more to the story, but we won't worry about that for now). Imagine an individual is given the vaccine, responds well, and produces antibodies. How would these antibodies protect that individual from getting sick from the novel coronavirus? I.e., what generally do antibodies accomplish that is protective? Briefly explain - it should be possible to correctly answer this question in just a correct sentence or two.

SCENARIO: Dr. Kushner is planning on conducting a study next semester. He is curious as to whether sleep deprivation is associated with poorer cognitive performance. For example, if you sleep poorly the night before a big exam, will you do worse? Dr. Kushner is especially curious about selective sleep deprivation, where people are kept from entering REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Using an electroencephalograph (EEG) to monitor brain waves, he plans to let participants sleep until they enter REM sleep and then wake them. After the participants are awake for one minute, Dr. Kushner plans to let them return to sleep. As they enter REM sleep again, he will wake them again and follow the same procedure. He plans to do this through the entire eight-hour sleep session. The following morning, participants will be asked to take a sample SAT test. QUESTION:  Dr. Kushner is deciding whether he needs to give participants a reason for waking them up several times during the night. He knows that he cannot tell them the real reason, but he is unsure whether he should deceive them (give them a false reason why he is waking them up) or provide them with no cover story at all. Which of the following issues should be considered most heavily when deciding whether to use deception?

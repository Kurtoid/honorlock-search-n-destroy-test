Problem 2 An F-shaped metal body welded to a collar is supported by two cables and a pin as shown.  There is a 480 N force applied at point B.  Neglecting the weight of the body, what are the tensions in the cables and the components of reactions at point A?      For all forces, give scalar values with units.  For any component of reaction that does not exist at a given support, enter NA. Ax = [Ax] Ay = [Ay] Az = [Az] MAx = [MAx] MAy = [MAy] MAz = [MAz] TCD = [T_CD] TBE = [T_BE]

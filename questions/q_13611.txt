A case control study was conducted to investigate the cause of Mare Reproductive Loss Syndrome (MRLS), a condition identified in 2001 in mares in Kentucky. Case mares (mares affected with MRLS) and non-case mares (those affected with a reproductive loss but proven not to be MRLS) were identified. Within the investigation, the following table was produced.

You are analyzing DNA to determine which suspect was at a crime scene with a victim. You have PCR amplified short tandem repeats (STRs) from the samples and separated them via gel electrophoresis to perform "DNA fingerprinting" as follows. DNA sources are noted above each lane: Victim (Lane 1), Suspect 1 (Lane 2), Suspect 2 (Lane 3), and Crime Scene (Lane 4). DNA was loaded into wells at the top of the gel, near the lane-labels  (i.e. "Victim", etc.).  Question:  Some of your bands in lab looked brighter than others; similarly, some bands in this gel are thicker than others. If one band looks thicker (or brighter) than another, what does this tell us about this thicker band, i.e., why is it thicker? A sentence or two should suffice.

Bass Attack Guide Services (BAGS) is a bass fishing guide service.  Currently, they offer half-day and full-day fishing trips.  Trips are available on Guntersville or Pickwick Lake.  The cost of a half-day trip is $200 per person and a full-day trip is $300 per person.  Design a simple database that can help BAGS store the information they need to maintain the business.  Identify the entities (including any associative entities), attributes, data types, and keys.  List your design and describe the relationships like the following example of an Authors table: AuthorsAuthorID , Int, Primary Key, Auto IncrementFirstName, VarChar (20)LastName, VarChar (20)etc.... Then describe the relationship types for related entities. Do not leave many to many relationships in your design.  For example: Authors to Authorbooks is a one to many relationship. Books to Authorbooks is a one to many relationship. etc.... Submit your design for the BAGS database.

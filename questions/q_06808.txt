Pepsin is an enzyme that breaks down proteins in your stomach. This enzyme is only activated in your stomach because a protein destroying enzyme would destroy important cell components anywhere else. Pepsinogen, an inactive form of pepsin, is secreted into the stomach by cells. Pepsinogen is converted to pepsin by the acids in your stomach. Once pepsin is created, it can turn other pepsinogen molecules into pepsin. So, the conversion of pepsinogen into pepsin causes more pepsinogen to be converted into pepsin.

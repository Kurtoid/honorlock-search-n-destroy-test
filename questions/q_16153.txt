A group of students has been trained to increase their score on the math segment of the S.A.T.  For the general population, S.A.T.-Math scores are distributed N (505,105). It is reasonable to assume that the shape of the distribution is unchanged by training effects, but is shifted, hopefully to the right. It follows that we assume that s =105. For a random sample, of size n = 100 the sample mean   S.A.T.-math score is 529.    Test  Ho: =505  vs. Ha: >505 at the a =.05 level of significance. The following triple (z-score, p-value, Your Conclusion) is produced when the data is properly input into your calculator

Consider the room shown below. The floor is 0.8 m wide and the back wall is 1.2 m high. The floor has an emissivity of 0.75 and is maintained at 400 K. The back wall is black and is maintained at 550 K. The back sides of all the surfaces are insulated. The front wall, the two side walls, and the ceiling are treated as one surface maintained at 290 K with an emissivity of 0.85, and an area of 3.268 m2. If F31 = 0.29 and F32 = 0.48, determine:  Draw the thermal resistance network representing the problem Net rate of radiation heat transfers between the floor and the back wall. Net rate of radiation heat transfers between the floor and the surrounding surfaces.  Show all your work on the work upload (assumptions, schematics, analysis, etc.) document. Write down units in your equations. Solve symbolically and plug in numbers at the end.
This concept includes the process of data governance, patient identification, authorization validation, amendments and record corrections, and audit validation.

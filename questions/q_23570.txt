[5 points] Consider a 3-period lot sizing problem with the demand vector D = (30,40,25). The fixed production setup cost is $200, the unit variable production cost is $6, and the unit inventory holding cost is $2 per period. Assume that the initial inventory level and the ending inventory level must be zero. Find the optimal lot sizing schedule for this setting using the path enumeration method.        [5 points] A car rental company rents cars at a rate of $50 per day. Cars are rented for one day only. The company does not own its own cars but leases them on a daily basis from a large firm. The rental company must specify the number of cars it intends to lease on a given day. The daily lease fee paid to the firm is $30 per car per day. The rental company knows that the daily demand has a normal distribution with mean of 200 and variance of 121. If the company leases more cars than are requested as rentals, it will get back $12 for each car unrented. Find the optimal number of cars that the rental company should lease every day.

This is Question D. Please write your solution complete with your full name and the problem number. When you are finished with the auto-graded portion of the exam, upload your solution to the Question D assignment in the Exam 1 module within 15 minutes.  Recall that the set {0,1}* is the set of finite length bit strings. Consider the recursive function flip which takes bit strings for inputs and gives bit strings for outputs, defined by the following: Foundation rule: flip(l) = l. Constructor rule: For s [?] {0,1}*, flip(s0) = flip(s)1 and flip(s0) = flip(s)1.  (3 points, 1 point each.) Show the output when flip is applied to the following strings. What is:   flip(010)?  flip(1101)?  flip(0010)?   (7 points.) Use structural induction to show that flip(flip(s)) = s for any s [?] {0,1}*.

QUESTION 7          A small steel ball is released at the surface of some oil of known viscosity and begins to sink. The diagrams show the forces acting on the ball shortly after its release and when it has reached terminal velocity.          Right click on the button to open the diagram of the falling steel ball in a new window.                          7.1   Identify forces X, Y and Z.    (3)                   7.2   Copy the axes and sketch a velocity-time graph for the motion of the steel ball.   Right click on the button to open a diagram of the axes in a new window.     (2)                   7.3   A student uses Stokes' law to calculate force Y. State the measurements the student should make to calculate force Y acting on the ball when it is moving at terminal velocity.   (2)                   7.4   After reaching terminal velocity, the steel ball took 10 seconds to fall through 30 cm of oil. Calculate the terminal velocity of the steel ball.   (2)                   7.5   The steel ball has a radius of 0,3 cm and the viscosity of the oil is 0,5 Pa.s. Calculate the viscous drag.   (3)

Use this scenario to answer questions #39-42:  You are caring for a 12-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She is responsive, but she does not feel well and appears to be flushed. Her temperature is 39degC (102.2degF), heart rate is 118/min, respiratory rate is 36/min, blood pressure is 100/40 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Your assessment reveals mild increase in work of breathing and bounding pulses. The child is receiving 100% oxygen by nonrebreathing mask.   What assessment finding is most important in your determination of the severity of the patient's condition?

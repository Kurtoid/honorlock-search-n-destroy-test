Dwight Hanes, a law student and amateur photographer, approaches Professor Teight Buns and offers him $100 to pose in Hanes underwear for a photo shoot. Hanes claims (falsely) that he is from the family that owns Hanes underwear, and he promises Professor Buns that the photos will be part of a calendar featuring a combination of fit male law professors and famous athletes wearing Hanes underwear. Hanes assures Professor Buns that the calendars will be print only, limited edition, and that 100% of the proceeds will go to a scholarship fund for aspiring law students. Professor Buns reluctantly agrees to the photo shoot and poses on a fake bearskin rug. Before doing so, he signs, without reading, a contract with a clause stating that the written terms of the agreement constitute the entirety of the parties' agreement as to the subject matter and supersede all prior agreements, written or oral, relating to the subject matter. The written agreement states that the sole purpose of the agreement is to raise money for Hanes's photography business. Within hours of the shoot, images of Professor Buns in Hanes underwear go viral on the Internet. If he were to sue Dwight Hanes, would a court allow in evidence of Dwight's oral representations as to the purposes of the photo shoot?

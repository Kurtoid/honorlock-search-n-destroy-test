A 60-year-old male was seen by a dermatologist at the request of his primary care physician while hospitalized for other medical conditions. The patient states he spends a lot of time outdoors as a mailman and golfing every weekend. The patient expresses the concern that he may have skin cancer. He remembers that his father, a farmer, had many of these same kind of lesions on his arms and neck through the years. After performing a thorough skin examination, the physician finds multiple brown annular keratotic lesions on the patient's arms and lower legs with patchy dry areas around them. The physician performs a skin biopsy by excising a piece of a lesion on his right lower arm and examines the lesion microscopically. No cancer type cells are seen. Given the patient's history of the same lesions in the family and his frequent exposure to ultraviolet sunlight, the physician explains to the patient that he has what is referred to as DSAP, or disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis. Further, he explains there is no treatment to prevent these lesions from returning once removed. The patient elects not to have any lesions removed at this time but will consider it and make an appointment in the future if he decides to have them removed. Code only the reason for the consultation and the procedure performed as result of the consultation.

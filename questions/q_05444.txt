R Section (50 points total) Instructions:  To get full points you must show all your code and describe your findings briefly (2-4 sentences per question).  Make sure to label each question you are answering clearly, using the given question numbers. Failure to do so will result in 1 point reduction for each question left unlabelled.  Upload your answer as a single file, using either an R script or a word document.     Using the anes_exam.csv dataset do the following: Questions 1-3: 15 points  Import the dataset called anes_exam.csv.  This dataset includes four variables coded as shown below:  Ideology is coded: 1 = extremely liberal; 2 = liberal; 3 = slightly liberal; 4 = moderate; 5 = slightly conservative; 6 = conservative; 7 = extremely conservative; 99 = haven't thought much about this; -8 = don't know; -9 = refused to answer Education is coded: 0= no high school degree; 1= high school degree & some post high school education; 2 = college degree; 3 = graduate degree Race is coded: 1 = white; 2 = black; 3 = Asian; 4 = native American; 5 = Hispanic; 6 = other race; -9 = refused to answer Defense spending is a 7 point scale coded as: 1 = Government should decrease defense spending; 4 = neither nor, neutral; 7 = Government should increase defense spending.       First, check how variables ideology, education, race, and defense are coded in the dataset. As you should always check your variables before using them in any data analysis.  Remove the missing values from those variables that have missing values.    Questions 4-6: 15 points  What is the total sum of values in variable defense? What is the mean and median for variable: a) defense, b) education? Do a crosstabulation between defense and education. Defense is the dependent variable and education the independent variable. Your crosstabulation output must show column percentages and the chi2. Explain your findings.    Questions 7-8: 10 points  Create a new variable for race, using the race variable provided to you. The new race variable must be codes as follows: 0 = white; 1 = black; 2 = hispanic, 3 = all other races. Convert the new variable you created for race into a factor variable.    Question 9-10: 10 points  9. Estimate a multivariate regression, using  defense as the dependent variable, and the other three variables (ideology, education, race) as independent variables. In this regression model you must use the new variable you created for race. Therefore, variable race must be a factor variable. 10. What is the estimated effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable? A) Is the relationship positive, negative, or zero? What does it mean? B) Is the estimate relationship, for each variable, statistically significant? Answer these questions for each estimated regression coefficient for the independent variables.

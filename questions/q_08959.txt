Harvey and Jim are neighboring farmers who both raise Hereford cattle. There is a fence that separates their adjoining pastures. By a contractual agreement, Jim had agreed to the upkeep and maintenance of the fence for a period of 5 years. Within that 5 year period, a gaping hole in the fence comes to Harvey's attention. Harvey notifies Jim of the hole in the fence, but Jim does absolutely nothing for over three months, even after Jim visually sees the gap in the fence. After three months, the cattle roam freely across both pastures and it is nearly impossible for both owners to figure out who owns which Herefords. Harvey sues Jim concerning the incident and at trial Jim is unable to submit any evidence as to which Hereford's he owns (even though in actuality he owns 170 of the Herefords and Harvey owns 630). How many Herefords will Jim be awarded in this confusion lawsuit?

Problem 7 For coding problems write the code to have no compile, simulation, or synthesis errors. Declare all variables. Write your code in Verilog or System Verilog. a) Write a full adder module named FA that adds single bit input A and B and carry in C and places this in output S. The carry out should be named Cout.  Remember that S = A AB AC, and Cout is 1 if any two of A, B, and C are 1.     b) Using this full adder module you just wrote, write a ripple adder module named FA4 that adds AA and BB which are 4 bit numbers, with carry in Cin. The result should go in 4 bit output Sum, with carry out Cout which is 1 bit. Include an overflow calculation and an overflow output OF. Overflow occurs when the carry in to the last bit and the carry out from it are different.   Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables. Do not use compiler directives.

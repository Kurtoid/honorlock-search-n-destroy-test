QUESTION 7     A laboratory technician is supplied with three unlabeled bottles containing an alcohol, an aldehyde and an alkane with comparable molecular masses, respectively. She takes a sample from each bottle and marks them P, Q and R. In order to identify each sample, she determines the boiling point of each under the same conditions. The results are shown in the attached table.   Right click on the following blue button to open the diagram in a new tab.       7.1   For this investigation, write down the: 7.1.1 Independent variable 7.1.2 Dependent variable   (1) (1)     7.2   Which sample (P, Q or R) is the: 7.2.1 Alkane 7.2.2 Alcohol 7.2.3 Refer to boiling point and the type of intermolecular forces present between alcohol molecules to give a reason for the answer to QUESTION 7.2.2.   (1) (1)   (2)     7.3   The alkane is identified as pentane. Will the boiling point of hexane be HIGHER or LOWER THAN that of pentane? Refer to MOLECULAR STRUCTURE, INTERMOLECULAR FORCES and ENERGY required to explain the answer.   (4)             [10]

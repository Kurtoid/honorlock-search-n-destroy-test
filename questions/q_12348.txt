QUESTION 6         A boy pushes his little brother in a cart. The cart starts to move.     Right click on the button to open the picture of the boy and his brother in a new window.    The little brother and cart have a total mass of 50 kg. They travel at a velocity of 4 m/s.         6.1   State the relationship between momentum, mass and velocity.    (1)     6.2   Calculate the momentum of the little brother and cart.    (3)     6.3   The boy applies a steady force for a time of 1.5 s. The momentum of the little brother and cart increases by 450 kg m/s.  Calculate the force which the boy applies.    (3)     6.4   Momentum is a vector quantity.  State what is meant by a vector quantity.    (2)     6.5   The photograph shows a mother and her daughter stationary on an ice rink.

12. A hospital division consists of three large nursing units, A, B, and C. The registered nurses (RN's) in units A, B, and C earn $30, $27, and $24 per hour, respectively. Overtime is paid at time-and-a-half. There is also the possibility of assigning some of the hours from nurses assigned to unit A to meet requirements in units B and/or C. The division wants to develop a 4-month staffing plan. The minimum number of labor hours required in each unit each month are:     January February March April   Unit A 2700 2300 2100 2600   Unit B 2400 2800 2900 2200   Unit C 2100 2600 2300 2400    The number of regular-time hours allocated for any individual unit should be the same in each of the 4 months (i.e., regular-time hours in unit A might be more or less than units B or C, however the number of regular-time hours assigned for A in January must be the same number in A for Feb, March, etc.). Overtime can be used as needed in any unit, but cannot exceed 18% of regular-time hours in any month. In any given month, up to 15% of the total number of regular-time plus overtime hours available from nurses assigned to unit A can be used to meet nursing requirements in units B and/or C. Develop a linear programming formulation that will determine the assignment of regular-time and overtime nursing hours to each nursing unit each month. The objective of the model is to minimize total staffing costs for the division during the 4-month period. Constraints of the model should guarantee that nursing hours meet or exceed the labor hours required in each unit each month, and that the overtime and substitution (i.e., using hours assigned to A to meet requirements in B and/or C) conditions are satisfied.

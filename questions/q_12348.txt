The peak age of susceptibility is between 6 and 12 months after birth. At this time maternal antibodies acquired by the child during fetal gestation are nearly gone, but the child is not yet generating robust antibody responses to new infections. As children with this immunodeficiency get older and produce their own antibodies, they outgrow this disease and show no further evidence of these recurrent infections. Based on this information, name one likely gene deficiency in the complement system that could cause this immunodeficiency and the specific complement pathway likely to be affected.

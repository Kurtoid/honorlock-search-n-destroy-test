Use Hess's law to calculate DGdegrxn using the following information.NO(g) + O(g) - NO2(g)DGdegrxn = ?2 O3(g) - 3 O2(g)DGdegrxn = +489.6 kJO2(g) - 2 O(g)DGdegrxn = +463.4 kJNO(g) + O3(g) - NO2(g) + O2(g)DGdegrxn = - 199.5 kJ

So for example, for Firm A to reduce pollution by the first unit would require it spends $50, for the second unit $100, the third $150, and for the fourth unit it would require $250 and that it had already reduced pollution by the first three units (spending $300 to clean up the first three units).  If the government reduced pollution by 8 units by selling pollution permits, how much would it cost in clean-up to reduce pollution by 8 units? Hint: find the cost of reducing the cheapest 8 units.

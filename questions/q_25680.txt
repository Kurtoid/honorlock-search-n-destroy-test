Eudaimonia is Aristotle's name for the highest good. Which of the following is the best translation of this word?
"I believe, we shall find arguments in favor of the retention of the Philippines as possessions of great value and a source of great profit to the people of the United States which cannot be overthrown. First, as to the islands themselves. They are over a hundred thousand square miles in extent, and are of the greatest richness and fertility. From these islands . . . there is no tropical product which cannot be raised in abundance. . . . "A much more important point is to be found in the markets which they furnish. The total value of exports and imports for 1896 amounted in round numbers to $29,000,000. . . . There can be no doubt that the islands in our peaceful possession would take from us a very large proportion of their imports. . . . With the development of the islands and the increase of commerce and of business activity the consumption of foreign imports would rapidly advance, and of this increase we should reap the chief benefit. . . . ". . . Manila, with its magnificent bay, is the prize and the pearl of the East. In our hands it will become one of the greatest distributing points, one of the richest emporiums of the world's commerce. Rich in itself, with all its fertile islands behind it, it will . . . enable American enterprise and intelligence to take a master share in all the trade of the Orient! We have been told that arguments like these are sordid. Sordid indeed! . . . A policy which proposes to open wider markets to the people of the United States . . . seems to me a great and noble policy."   - Henry Cabot Lodge, senator, speech to the United States Senate, 1900   Question: Which of the following best explains the historical situation that caused opponents of Lodge to call arguments such as the ones in the excerpt "sordid"?
On a remote island a biologist is studying a population of unique spiders.  Color of the spiders is controlled by an autosomal, co-dominant locus where the genotype BB = Blue and GG = Green.  Heterozygous spiders (genotype BG) express both colors and therefore appear Yellow. A second autosomal locus (different chromosome), spiders homozygous (nn) do hatch from the egg but cannot feed and dies within a week.  Homozygous (NN) and heterozygous (Nn) spiders are completely normal. Two Yellow, Normal spiders (BGNn) are crossed and at hatching they produce 20 Blue, 40 Yellow, and 20 Green progeny. If the biologist follows these progeny for a month, how many of the Yellow offspring would you predict to be alive?  (Answer with a whole number - 2, 18, 45 etc).

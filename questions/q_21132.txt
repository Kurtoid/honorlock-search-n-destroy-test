The local Starbucks menu and convenience store beverage may too quickly become an enemy of the gut.  Consuming too much sugar can also put people at risk of developing heart disease.  According to the Journal of the American Heart Association, eating large amounts of sugar will raise the amount of sugar in the blood, and this can lead to heart disease and heart failure (32).  It's reasonable to assume that too much sugar can cause multiple health problems at once.  Therefore, the amount of sugar in the diet should be considered very carefully. Explain the cause and the effect in this paragraph.

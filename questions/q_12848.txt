An aerated lagoon is to be designed for a community with 0.55 MGD of raw wastewater flow rate. The following information is available.  BOD5 applied to the aerated lagoons: 131 mg/L Oxygen requirement: 1.75 lb O2/lb BOD5 applied to the lagoon The mechanical aerators furnish 1.6 lb O2/hp-hr. Design width: 103 ft Design length: 335 ft Design depth: 12 ft     (5 pts) Determine organic mass loading to the aerated lagoons (unit: lb BOD5/day). (5 pts) If mixing power intensity (MPI) was 0.066 hp/1,000 ft3, but the minimum requirement of MPI for design is 0.15 hp/1,000 ft3, determine power requirements per aerated lagoon (unit: hp). (Hint: power requirements per aerated lagoon = MPI x aerated lagoon volume)

Consider the following scenario: Jayson is a 22-year-old collegiate soccer player, who has recently been diagnosed with Celiac disease. He has most meals in the dining hall with other athletes, greatly enjoys large spaghetti dinners and pizza nights at his teammate's house each week, and he has always placed a lot of importance on socializing and being a central part of the team. However, he has been having some gastrointestinal symptoms when he eats gluten, and he has noticed that his ability to play well for the team has been impacted. Jayson knows that eliminating gluten will be beneficial to his health and help him feel better and play better, but he is very concerned about how the drastic dietary changes will affect his social life and potentially isolate him from his friends and teammates. He doesn't want to be "that guy" who has to have "special" food that's different from what everyone else is eating. Right now, his symptoms are still manageable, and he is unsure of whether he really needs to go gluten-free, or if he would even be able to comply with that type of eating pattern. Using the Looking Forward technique, please write out an example of how your dialogue with Jayson may go. Explore what the future might look like if he chooses to switch to an entirely gluten-free diet or if he chooses to continue on with his current lifestyle.

In this problem, you will write a complete program (this means all of the required code) to copy only some of the numbers in a table in program memory, starting at address 0xA744 (TAB1), to another table in data memory, starting at address 0x3701 (TAB2). [1] Only copy values in TAB1 that have a lower nibble of 3 or 7. Hint: 3 = 0b00000011 and 7 = 0b00000111. [2] The copying should end when the lower nibble of a value in TAB1 is 0. [3] Create a table for TAB1 to test your program with at least 4 bytes, including a proper ending byte. [4] Do not assume that TAB1 or TAB2 are in any way initialized for you. In your provided response, format all text with the "Preformatted" style given by Canvas.

Welcome to CS 6400! In order to gauge your knowledge of how the class operates, we will ask you a few questions in this short exam.  Some of the questions you'll be asked here come from the syllabus, others from course policies, so please be sure to have those resources available to you for reference.  (These links open in new tabs - if Honorlock has taken your browser full screen, remember that you can use the Control-Tab keyboard shortcut to flip between them.). Keep in mind that on a normal exam, you would not be able to access any Internet resources, but for this exam, we aren't expecting you to have any notes to help you answer these questions, so viewing the syllabus and Canvas pages are OK for this exam only. You can take this exam as many times as you like, and your highest score will be kept. If you don't view the policy pages and/or fail to complete the onboarding exam, in the event you violate a course policy, you are still liable for any penalties you may receive.

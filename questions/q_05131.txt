The context of this question are the instructions and details provided above in the "Hands-on-Testing" text.  Your test cases reveal that the SUT has a defect that makes the system report an error in certain situations and the error stays until we click the button "empty the basket". The system reports the error when we try to add a very expensive product, but only if two very expensive products already have been in the basket, even if they have been deleted. This problem never happens if a test case added and deleted many, e.g. 1,000, very cheap products.  Two examples (not necessarily complete):   The test case: AddExpensive, RemExpensive, AddExpensive, RemExpensive, AddExpensive - triggers this defect.   The test case: AddExpensive, RemExpensive, AddExpensive, RemExpensive, AddCheap - doesn't trigger this defect.    Describe and explain the defect and what the cause is.

A horizontal uniform meter ruler of mass 3.00kg is suspended from the ceiling by two strings. The first string, tied at the 10.0cm mark, has tension T1, and the second string, tied at the 80.0cm mark, has tension T2. If the ruler is in equilibrium, find the tensions T1 and T2. T1=[ten1]N T2=[ten2]N

In surface-water hydrology, a hydrograph is a representation of how a watershed responds to a rainfall event over time. The area under a hydrograph gives the total volume of water produced by the storm. Time and observed flow data are given in Excel under the "Final-Q4" tab. Calculate the total volume of water produced by the storm in cubic feet by applying the trapezoidal rule in Excel. Flow is given in cubic feet per second and must be converted to cubic feet per hour first before using Trapezoid Rule. 1 hour = 3600 seconds. Note: This is an Excel spreadsheet problem and no programming is required. Once complete, please type a one-word essay (e.g., "ok") for this question and then upload your combined Excel file at the very end of this exam.

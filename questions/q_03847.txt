Traffic Jams - Are genes on chrX limited in their transcriptional activity? Model: Since genes on chrX can only be expressed from one chromosome, as males only have one X, the ability to express a gene at very high rates on X chr is limited owing to potential transcriptional traffic jams. Below are some transcriptome data from adult humans.  RNA from many tissues and organs were sampled (heart, Liver shown). Genes were subdivided into those on the X chromosome vs. autosomes, and then further separated into low or high levels of transcription. * indicates significant differences (p < 0.01).     Answer the following questions:  Categorize the level of transcription for genes on autosomes vs chromosome X based only on the data above. Do these data support a chrX traffic-jam model?

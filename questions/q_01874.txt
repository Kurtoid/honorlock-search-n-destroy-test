When caring for a female child who has possibly been sexually abused, you should:
*I. Argue either for or against the implementation or "handling" of federalism's division of powers in the U.S. today, in the context of any of the related issues discussed in the text/class:  gay marriage (now legal everywhere), medical marijuana (legal in some areas...), or immigration/border laws.  Your argument will be judged on your understanding of federalism and application to the issue you select, not on which side you take.  You would talk about federalism and why the issue relates to it, how this has changed over time, etc.  Support your argument.  Talk about both the "heart of the Constitution" as well as "reserved powers."   *II.  Describe the process by which an amendment to the Constitution comes into effect.  Be sure to include both the processes of proposing and ratifying; each process' alternate routes; and the requisite percents/fractions. What benefit(s) is(are) had by this process?  Also, discuss which branch is most strikingly left out of this process, and argue if this is a good thing or not.    *Note, this may not take 3-4 paragraphs.  Remember, as with the rest of the test, no notes/text/online resources may be used!      *III. Attack or defend the use of ballot initiatives, referendums, and recalls by states (describing what each is), and say why James Madison was right or wrong in seeking to contain "factions".  Your argument will be judged on your understanding of Madison's position on this matter, not on which side you take.  You would need to include the topics of traditional republicanism, direct democracy, etc., as you judge whether or not ballot initiatives and the others are good to have.  Finally, if a ballot initiative or referendum were passed, how might the "heart of the Constitution" apply?

Fraud Investigation Case Part 3 About halfway through the interview, you say to Teagard, "We've been conducting an investigation of these Quantix invoices, and we know you're the one who's been stealing from the company. This amounts to fraud." Taylor does not deny the crime outright. Instead, he makes a weak, qualified denial by claiming that he wasn't in the office on the day one of the invoices was approved for payment. You then repeat the accusation. In order to make it psychologically easier to admit to the crime, the attorney says, "Look, we understand that you didn't want to hurt anybody. You've been a good employee and you probably wouldn't have done this if you didn't really need the money. If the company had treated you better, you probably wouldn't have had to do this at all." Eventually, Taylor confesses to the crime. He says he had amassed substantial gambling debts and he just needed the money on a short-term basis to pay off what he owed. He claims he intended to pay all the money back. At the conclusion of the interview, the attorney prepares a written confession for Teagard to sign. The confession includes the information that Taylor gave in his verbal confession, along with the following statement:  I needed the money to pay off some pressing debts, which is why I borrowed these funds. I did not mean to commit a crime. I thought that as long as I paid the money back with interest, this was not illegal, and the company would not be hurt.  Teagard reads the statement and signs it in the presence of you and the attorney. Part 3 Question 1: Was it appropriate for you to accuse Teagard of the crime and, if so, was the accusation made in an appropriate manner? Explain. Part 3 Question 2: Was it appropriate for the attorney to rationalize Teagard's behavior and, if so, was this done in an appropriate manner? Explain. Part 3 Question 3: What are the major elements that should be included in the written confession? Was it appropriate for the attorney to prepare the confession and have Teagard sign it?

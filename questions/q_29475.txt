Read the statement below carefully. Answer True if you think a statement it TRUE. Answer False if you think the statement is FALSE. Give a brief explanation or example to justify your answer. The goal of environmental policy is to protect the natural resources that people use while considering the values that people place on resources, and to promote equity in the use of resources.

A schematic of Gibbs free energy of mixing D G as a function of volume fraction of polymer B, phB for a polymer blend (i.e., a mixture of polymer A and polymer B) at four different temperatures is shown below. Assume polymer blend is fully phase-mixed when temperature T >= 440 K. (i) Sketch (a) the temperature T vs. volume fraction of polymer B (phB) phase diagram by identifying several T and phB from the D G ~ phB plot, and (b) spinodal curve for this polymer blend. Moreover, indicate the single-phase region, two-phase region, metastable region, and unstable region, respectively.                                                                                                                                 (6 pts)  Note: you do not need to sketch quantitatively, yet do show clearly in your sketch as to how the binodal and spinodal curves are constructed.  (ii) How will the phase diagram change in terms of the critical temperature TC , critical volume fraction phB, C, and the overall shape, when the molecular weight of polymer B increases? Justify your answer and sketch a new phase diagram.               (6 pts)
As Swiss cheese matures, a variety of chemical processes take place. The taste of matured cheese is related to the concentration of several chemicals in the final product. In a study of cheese in a certain region of Switzerland, samples of cheese were analyzed for lactic acid concentration and were subjected to taste tests. The numerical taste scores were obtained by combining the scores from several tasters. A scatterplot of the observed data is shown below: What is a plausible value for the correlation between lactic acid concentration and taste rating? Table (Links to an external site.) Scatterplot

Max owns a business called Maximillians's Music Emporium (MME). MME sells rare records from a shop in a busy high street. Max has run MME for six years. He sells a wide range of rare records and has an excellent reputation. His reputation has meant that customers in the UK trust him, as do the growing number of customers from the rest of the world. Max has noticed that more of his customers (in the UK and Worldwide) are now buying records online rather than visiting his shop. Max has a very simple website. He will need to develop this website if he is to meet the increasing demand from customers buying records online. At the moment, customers who buy online are creating work only for Max, as he is the one who packs and posts the records bought, once the shop has closed. Max plans to keep his high street shop open and rent storage space for his large stock of rare records in another part of the town where costs will be cheaper. Max wants to grow his business and his friend has advised him to change the ownership of the company to a private limited company so that he has limited liability .Max wants to explore all the options available to him .

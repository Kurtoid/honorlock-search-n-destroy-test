KMT2D (lysine methyltransferase 2D) is a gene that encodes an important protein found throughout vertebrate tissues. The initial transcript is ~42,000 bases long and contains 54 exons. The resulting mRNA codes for ~5,500 amino acids.  One key function of the protein is to methylate the Lys-4 position of histone H3. This methylation plays a major role in gene regulation during embryonic development and tissue differentiation.

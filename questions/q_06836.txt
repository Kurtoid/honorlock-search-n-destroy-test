Far from being America's favorite food, during the early 1900s, hamburgers were considered "food for the poor."  Restaurants generally didn't sell them.  Burgers were served at lunch carts parked near factories, at circuses, and at carnivals.  It was widely believed that ground beef was made from rotten old meat full of chemical preservatives. In the mid1920s, however, a man named Walt Anderson set out to defend the hamburger from its many critics.  Walt loved burgers and opened a small restaurant devoted to selling them--the firstWhite Castle--in Wichita, Kansas. Walt grilled the burgers right in front of his customers, so they could see for themselves that the meat and the equipment were clean. He also supported an unusual experiment at the University of Minnesota. For thirteen weeks, a medical student there consumed nothing but White Castle hamburgers and water.  When the student not only survived the experiment but also seemed pretty healthy, people started to view hamburgers in a new light. Now hamburgers seemed wholesome, not deadly.

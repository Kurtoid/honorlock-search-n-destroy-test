In a 2006 study, Gortmake and colleagues surveyed 80 lesbian and gay students at a large Midwestern state university to assess their experiences and their perceptions of the campus climate regarding lesbians and gays. The researchers asked each participant to rate his or her "outness" on a scale from 1 to 8. Based on their rating, all participants were classified as closeted or as out. One of the questions the researchers wished to address is whether "outness" depends on gender. (a) The researchers analyzed their data using the categorization out versus closeted as their measure of "outness." Given this measure, what kind of analysis did the authors use to determine whether outness varies with gender? (b) What kind of analysis would the authors have conducted if they had used the original rating scale of "outness" as the dependent variable? Why? (c) Explain why using the original rating scale as the dependent measure would be preferable to using the categorization of closeted or out.

In chapter 45 we discussed different types of species interactions. However, in a particular relationship between two or more species, these distinctions may not always be clear. Read the following scenario about a sea urchin and a crab, and name two possible interspecific interactions between these two species (the sea urchin and the crab). Make sure to explain why your choices are reasonable.   "Off the islands of Indonesia, a particular species of crab carries a large sea urchin on its back as the crab moves across the ocean floor. When a predatory fish arrives, the crab settles quickly into the sediments (sands) and puts its living shield to use. When a fish tries to bite the crab, the crab responds by tilting the spiny sea urchin toward whichever side the fish attacks. The fish eventually gives up and swims away." (Campbell Biology)

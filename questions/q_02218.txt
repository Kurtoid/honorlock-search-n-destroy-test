A large sheet of material 50 mm thick contains dissolved hydrogen (H2) having a uniform concentration of 3 kmol/m3. The sheet is exposed to a fluid stream that causes the concentration of the dissolved hydrogen to be reduced suddenly to zero at both surfaces. This surface condition is maintained constant thereafter. If the mass diffusivity of hydrogen is 8 x 10-7 m2/s, how much time is required to bring the density of dissolved hydrogen to a value of 1.2 kg/m3 at the center of the sheet? Hints: Use the same transient equation available for temperature distribution in chapter 5  to solve for the concentration distribution.

If the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall at a rate of 2 ft/s, how fast is the angle between the ladder and ground changing when the bottom of the ladder is 4 ft from the wall? (That is, find the angle's rate of change when the bottom of the ladder is 4 ft from the wall.) If necessary, round your answer to two decimal places.

A gardener received a pea plant from her neighbor, and she wants to know its genotype.  The neighbor told her it produces round peas, which is a dominant trait (R) to wrinkled peas (r).  The gardener performs a test cross and observes that half of the offspring plants produce wrinkled peas.  What is the genotype of the plant she received from her neighbor? (

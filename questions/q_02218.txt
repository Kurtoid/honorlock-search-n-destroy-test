Questions 24-29 are all based on the same passage: "Step into a Different Neighborhood". Read the paragraph carefully and the question that follows it. Then, use context clues to select the proper answer choice. One day, a wealthy father took his son, Calvin, on a trip to a neighborhood less fortunate than theirs. He wanted to expose Calvin to a different way of living. Mr. Jamison, the father, hoped this trip would make Calvin more grateful for his privileges.

They parked their 2019 BMW M4 on Elmhurst Street, which happened to be the street where Mr. Jamison grew up. Then, they began to walk through the neighborhood. While looking around the area, Calvin immediately noticed many differences. The streets in Brewster were busier and noisier than those in Cambridge Meadows. Traffic was heavier. More people were walking. A few stray dogs and cats wandered about. Above everything, what stood out most to Calvin was how happy the people were to see his father.

Suddenly, Brewster Village started to feel like a quite fortunate place. What does the term "ritzy" mean as it is used in the paragraph?

A non-uniform sphere rolls down a hill without slipping.  It has mass m = 8 kg, moment of inertia I{"version":"1.1","math":"I"} = 0.150 kg*m2, and radius r = 0.20.  It starts from rest at a height of h = 6.0m above the base of the slope.  Find the velocity (in m/s) of the sphere at the base of the slope.

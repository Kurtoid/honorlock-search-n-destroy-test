Directions: Answer the questions presented in essay format (min. 500 words). A successful essay will not only answer the questions presented but present as well as analyze text to support their answer. You must quote the work you are analyzing at least once and provide MLA documentation (see page 405 of The Writer's Reference). First, watch "Adman" (see the link provided in the "Final Exam Preparation" module in eCampus). You'll want to consider each of the following questions while watching the film, writing down potential quotations and examples for support: 1.) What is the goal or argument of this short film? 2.) Which rhetorical appeal do you feel is represented most strongly in this short film: ethos, pathos, or logos? Why do you feel that appeal is the strongest? 3.) What support/evidence does the short film provide for this? Your essay should follow this basic outline while answering the above questions:  Introduction--Provide a brief (no more than 10 sentences) summary of "Adman." End with a thesis statement indicating the goal or argument of the film and the rhetorical appeals used to further that goal or argument (e.g., "The film 'Adman' uses _____ to argue ______."). Body--At least two paragraphs developed around the film's use of your chosen rhetorical appeal. What support/evidence shows the film's use of your chosen appeal? Conclusion--How does the filmmaker's decision to focus on that appeal strengthen or weaken his argument? Why?  Remember that this must be written in formal, edited standard American English. This means you should have no contractions, second-person pronouns, slang, or first-person pronouns where not absolutely needed (e.g., "I believe the filmmaker wants the audience to see ____" vs. "The filmmaker wants the audience to see ____"--these are functionally identical--or "I see", which could be written as "The audience sees" instead). You should also take some time to read over your work for grammar errors. While this isn't my main focus in grading this, it is important to your grade nevertheless.

Read the following sources and answer the questions that follow.     Source A: In 1919, I was a member of the Committee which framed the Covenant, and I well remember the high and noble ideals to which all our thoughts were directed after the terrible ordeals of the War. The disappointment we experience today is bitter. The League is faced with a crisis, demonstrated by the abandonment of sanctions in the Abyssinian dispute. The League can only act by the agreement of its members. It is on the resolve of the Great States for collaboration and peace that the action of the League depends. The League will not be capable of accomplishing its mission so long as the Great States remain bound by rivalries, suspicions, threats and ambitions. Collective security presents evident weaknesses. Nations will hesitate long before going to war over a dispute in which their vital interests are not at stake. The little states remain deeply attached to the League. It is necessary, then, to maintain, defend and consolidate the League. We should not change the Covenant or call its principles into question. We must effect the necessary improvements by a more realistic application of the system of collective security. From an article by the Belgian politician Paul Hymans, 1936.     Source B: Collective security has been tried out and it has failed. There is no reason why, because the policy of collective security has failed, we should abandon the idea of the League and give up the ideals for which the League stands. But if we have retained any vestige of common sense, surely we must admit that we have tried to impose upon the League a task which was beyond its powers to fulfil. Member nations should review the situation and decide to limit the functions of the League. I believe that this might go far to restore the prestige of the League and the moral influence which it ought to exert in the world. But if the League were to be limited in this way, it must be admitted that it could no longer be relied upon by itself to secure the peace of the world. From a speech by Neville Chamberlain, British Prime Minister, 1936.     Source C: The framers of the Covenant saw that it would be foolish to create a super-state to override national governments. They rejected the idea, much favoured in France, of a League army or police, or of any other method by which a member state might be compelled to bow to the League's will. Rather than violate in any way the sovereign rights of nation states, the founders were prepared that their League should be an association of countries, each protected from invasion of its domestic prerogatives by the requirement that any decisions of the League should receive unanimous assent. The League of Nations can be no better than the member states of which it is composed. If they wish for peace, the League provides machinery by which peace may be the better secured and maintained, but League or no League, a state which is resolved on war can always have it.

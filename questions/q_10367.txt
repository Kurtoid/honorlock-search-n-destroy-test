Write a method divisors(int n) that returns the number of divisors of a positive integer n that is passed into the method. A divisor of an integer n, also called a factor of n, is an integer which divides n without leaving a number. For example, the number 200 has 12 divisors (1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 200). Therefore divisors(200) should return 12. It is easy to test whether a number is a divisor or another number by the modulus operation. For example, 25 is a divisor of 200 because 200 % 25 is equal to 0; 6 is not a divisor of 200 because 200 mod 6 is equal to 2.

Message queues are an interesting abstraction in operating systems that helps tolerate delayed update failures in NFS. When an update to the remote file system fails due to network disconnection or instability, the update is performed locally on a local copy, or is logged in a Journal as a transaction ("message") to be applied on the remote file later when connection is restored. If you are the system engineer responsible for making changes by adding Message Queues to NFS, to tolerate disconnections, what other complications do you have to worry about and follow on with additional work around to resolve them. Describe two complications. (Max 100 words).

It was not until after World War II that most Southerners felt the impact of airconditioning. As one historian on the subject commented, "The air conditioner came to the South in a series of waves, and only with the wave of the 1950s was the region truly engulfed." Gradually air conditioning spread to department stores, banks, government buildings, hospitals, schools, and finally, homes and automobiles. Home air conditioning soared after the introduction in 1951 of an inexpensive, efficient window unit. By 1960, 18 percent of all Southern homes had either window units or central air conditioning. That number topped 50 percent in 1970 and almost 75 percent by 1980. "The South of the 1970s could claim air-conditioned shopping malls, domed stadiums, dugouts, greenhouses, grain elevators, chicken coops, aircraft hangers, crane cabs, off-shore oil rigs, cattle barns, steel mills, and drive-in movies and restaurants," wrote one historian.

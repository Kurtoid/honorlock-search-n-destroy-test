Case Study: An 18-year-old college student came home to visit her family for the weekend and was healthy until yesterday evening, when she went to bed with a headache, fever, and a stiff neck. This morning her mother found her drowsy and lethargic. On presentation to the emergency room she was found to have an elevated temperature, increased heart rate, and a purple blotchy rash on her trunk, legs, and wrists. Gram staining of blood cultures and skin lesions reveals Gram-negative diplococci. Her neck is stiff and cerebrospinal fluid cultures are also positive for Gram-negative diplococci.  What disease does this patient have? [disease] What organism is most likely infecting this patient? [organism] What virulence factor is responsible for the signs/symptoms in the patient? [virulence]
The following prompt applies to the next 3 questions: You are interested in understanding the gene regulation of LKP1, a protein that is normally produced only in the liver and kidney cells in mice. Interestingly, you find that the lkp1 gene is not expressed in heart cells. You isolate the DNA upstream of the lkp1 gene, place it upstream of the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP), and insert this entire piece of recombinant DNA into mice. You find GFP expressed in liver and kidney cells but not in heart cells, an expression pattern similar to the normal expression of the lkp1 gene. Further experiments demonstrate that there are three regions in the promoter, labeled A, B, and C in the below Figure that contribute to this expression pattern. Assume that a single and unique transcription factor binds each site such that protein X binds site A, protein Y binds site B, and protein Z binds site C. You want to determine which region is responsible for tissue-specific expression, and create mutations in the promoter to determine the function of each of these regions. In the below figure, if the site is missing, it is mutated such that it cannot bind its corresponding transcription factor.   A.  Which of the following proteins is likely to act as a transcriptional repressor? (Select all that apply)

The stimulant pseudoephedrine is used as a nasal decongestant. Its salts are used in many over-the-counter drugs, often in combination with additional active ingredients such as antihistamines. Consider the structure of N-protonated pseudoephedrine (shown below) and answer the following questions.  The lowest-energy conformation of N-protonated pseudoephedrine is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and the ammonium group. Which of the following Newman projections (A-F) represents this conformation viewed through the C1-C2 bond? [conformation]  Recall that dihedral angles are measured clockwise when answering the next two questions. Consider the conformation of N-protonated pseudoephedrine in which the hydroxyl group and the ammonium group are eclipsed. What is the dihedral angle between phenyl (Ph) substituent and ammonium group in this conformation? [dihedral1] What is the dihedral angle between the phenyl (Ph) substituent and the ammonium group in Newman structure A? [dihedral2] Do Newman structures C and E represent conformational isomers? [isomers]

How many integers from 1 through 1,000 are multiples of 3 or multiples of 5?Partial Solution. Let A = the set of all integers from 1 through 1,000 that are multiples of 3.Let B = the set of all integers from 1 through 1,000 that are multiples of 5. Then A [?] B = the set of all integers from 1 through 1,000 that are multiples of 3 or multiples of 5 and A [?] B = the set of all integers from 1 through 1,000 that are multiples of 15 N(A) = 333N(B) = 200 [Now calculate N(A [?] B) and use the inclusion/exclusion rule to solve for N(A [?] B).]

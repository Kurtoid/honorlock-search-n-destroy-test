For Questions 12~15: Signal Timing Design A four-phase intersection originally has three lanes for each approach: dedicated left (L), through (T), and through-right (T+R). The lane width for each lane is 12 ft and speed for all approach is 50mph. Assume level grade and lost start-up time of 2 seconds per phase. The layout, adjusted volumes, lane groupings, and saturation flows are as following.      NB   SB   EB   WB     L   T   T+R   L   T   T+R   L   T   T+R   L   T   T+R     200   420   285   250   300   260   180   525   475   220   550   458         Phasing: * Phase A: North-south left * Phase B: North-south through/through-right * Phase C: East-west left * Phase D: East-west through/through-right:   Saturation flow rates: *Left turns: 1580 pc/ln/h *Through: 1750 pc/ln/h *Through/right: 1800 pc/ln/h *Right turns: 1680 pc/ln/h     To improve the safety for bicyclists, the lane width for each lane has been reduced by 1ft (the total widths of the intersection keep the same) and the posted speed for all approach has been reduced by 5mph. If the above traffic volumes are unchanged but all the saturation flow rates have been reduced to 95% of original values due to the smaller lane width, answer the following questions.

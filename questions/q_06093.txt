The lengths are normally distributed (mound shaped).     a.   What proportion of adult Nile crocodiles will have lengths that will fall between 201 and 147 inches?   b.  A zoo buys an adult Nile crocodile whose length is 183 inches.  Is the length of the animal unusual?  Justify your answer mathematically.   c. If some adult Nile crocodile has a length with a z-score of   -  1.2, what is its actual length?

The following True/False questions pertain to the journal article discussed in class, A toolkit for studying cell surface shedding of diverse transmembrane receptors.      A. True/False:  Consider the schematic above for the authors' Synthetic Notch Assay for Proteolytic Switches (SNAPS). The ligand refers to DLL4 and the LBD refers to the EGF-repeats region of the Notch1 receptor.   B. True/False:  Similar to Notch, the putative proteolysis regions of the receptors CDHR2, PCDH15, and MUC1 only signal in the SNAPS when co-cultured with MS5-DLL4 cells.   C. True/False:  GSI (gamma-secretase inhibitor) inhibits intramembrane proteolytic cleavage of the chimera receptors.      D. True/False:  In contrast to Notch, there is a significant basal level of proteolysis for HER2 when the chimera is co-cultured with MS5 cells alone, which is enhanced in the presence of MS5-DLL4 cells.   E. True/False:  Herceptin antibody treatment inhibits the proteolysis of both HER2 and Notch.

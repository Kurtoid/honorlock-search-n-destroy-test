Essay #2                                                                Butterfly Company on January 1, 2021, enters into a nine-year noncancelable lease for standard-use machinery having an estimated useful life of 10 years and a fair value to Tranquility Corp. at the inception of the lease of $4,000,000. The implicit rate of borrowing rate is 8% and is known to the lessee. Tranquility manufactures the machinery at a cost of $3,000,000 and uses the straight-line method to depreciate its assets. The lease contains the following provisions:                                                                A. Annual Lease payments of $592,887.81 are payable at the beginning of each year beginning on 1/1/2021.                                                                B. No purchase option or transfer of ownership to the lessee is contained in the lease agreement.                                                                                                Requirements:                                1) Prepare the appropriate journal entries (including adjusting entries) for both Butterfly and Tranquility during the first year of the lease term (1/1/2021 thru 1/1/2022). Both companies have calendar year ends (i.e. 12/31/XX).                                2) Describe and quantify the impact of the lease on Butterfly's Balance Sheet and Income statement for the year ended 12/31/21                 3) As a modification to the initial lease terms above, assume the terms of the lease now include the ownship of the machinery transferring to the lessee at the end of the lease term. Describe and quantify the impact/changes, if any, to the journal entries of the lessee provided in requirement #1 above.                                4) As a modification to the initial lease terms above, assume the terms of the lease now include a purchase option (which is highly likely to be exercised) of $250,000 at the end of the lease term. Describe the impact/changes, if any, to the journal entries of the lessee provided in requirement #1 above.

Two common species of frogs from the genus Bombina (B. bombina and B. variegata) live in similar latitudes and ecological conditions, but in two different regions, Central and Eastern Europe. In a narrow strip between these regions, scientists have observed a third species, which might be a hybrid between the former diverging populations of the ancestral species. What evolutionary process might be responsible for the speciation in Bombina?

A colleague is proposing to investigate the chapter review quizzes on student test performance comparing two groups of 10 students who either do or do not complete review quizzes prior to the exam.

What advice would you give this researcher when they ask if they should conduct this study? What are the possible strategies that they could use to increase their power, and which of these do you recommend?

EEL 5490/4495 FINAL EXAM(a total of 6 questions)Spring 2021 1. (16%) A 300-m tower is located near Tampa, Florida. (a) Find the annual number of downward lightning strikes to the tower. (b) What is the probability that this tower will receive no downward lightning strikes during the first year of observation? (c) What are the differences between downward and upward lightning?     2. (16%) A cloud has positive QP and negative QN charge centers separated vertically, as shown below. (a) What is the direction of electric field vector at ground level directly below the charge centers, if magnitudes of the two charges are equal to each other? (b) Is the electric field in (a) positive or negative? Explain. (c) How to reverse the direction of this electric field vector if the spatial positions of charges are to be kept the same?      3. (20%) Design a passive electric field measuring system to detect electric fields produced by first return strokes in natural negative lightning at a distance of about 50 km. The recording device has an input resistance of 500 kO and an input capacitance of 15 pF. The recorder is connected to the electric field sensor and associated electronics via a short coaxial cable and has an input-voltage setting of -0.1 V to +0.1 V.   4. (16%) Discuss in detail each term of the general expressions for Ez and Bph on a perfectly conducting ground plane due to a lightning return stroke in a straight and vertical channel. [2% bonus for correctly and completely answering the following question: How would the field expressions change if the field point were elevated above ground?]     5. (16%) The return-stroke electric field peak measured at a distance of 100 km is 20 V/m. Estimate the peak current assuming that the return-stroke process can be represented by the transmission line (TL) model for the return-stroke speed v = 2 x 108 m/s. What is the magnetic field peak at a distance of 50 km for this stroke?     6. (16%) In up to one-half page discuss in your own words one specific topic of your choice covered in Sections 4a and 4b (Properties of the negative downward lightning discharge to ground) OR in Section 8 (Lightning locating systems and lightning protection). No overview of the entire Section of subsection is required, just choose a specific topic (no matter how small it is) that is of particular interest to you.

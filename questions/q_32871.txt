Q34.  In their experiment on DNA replication in E. coli, Meselson and Stahl grew E. coli in 15N nitrate for many generations and then allowed the cells to grow for one and for two cell divisions in the presence of 14N nitrate. They isolated DNA from the cells grown in 15N alone and from the cells grown for one and for two generations in 14N, and they used centrifugation in cesium chloride gradients to separate DNA molecules. This experiment made use of the fact that centrifugation of DNA through cesium chloride gradients separates DNA molecules that differ in:

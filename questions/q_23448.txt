Reading Comprehension: Read the article below and answer the questions that follow. A Surprise Race Winner    P1 When sixty-one-year-old farmer Cliff Young showed up to run a 543.7-mile (875 kilometer) race in 1983, no one took him seriously. The race goes from Sydney to Melbourne in Australia, between two of the country's largest shopping malls, and takes about five to seven days to complete. The typical runners in this intense race are elite athletes who rank high among the nation's athletes. Most of the runners are younger than thirty and have special training. Cliff Young was an exception when he showed up to run in rubber boots and long pants, with no special training. People were very surprised when Young said he was going to compete because, at first glance, the farmer didn't even seem likely to finish.  P2 However, Young felt that he had the capacity to complete the race. When people questioned him, he explained that he had grown up on a large sheep farm. His family had 2,000 sheep on 2,000 acres of land. His parents were too poor to afford horses or trucks to round up the sheep, so when storms came, Young had to bring all the sheep back to the barn on foot. He said that sometimes he ran with the sheep for two or three days, so he didn't think two more days of running would be too much for him. His reasoning was that the rigorous work on his family's sheep farm would help him finish the race, even though he didn't have specialized training.  P3 Initially, the elite athletes had an enormous lead over Young. In contrast to the long strides of the other runners, he ran in an unusual shuffle. He moved slowly and didn't pick up his feet. Some people were even worried about his safety. But he kept running.  P4 The other athletes planned for time to sleep; they would run for eighteen hours and sleep for six hours. Apparently, Young didn't know about this. He just continued to run through the night. When asked about his tactic for finishing, he said that he had never planned to sleep at all during the race.  P5 The extra time gradually gave Young an edge over the other runners. The change wasn't dramatic, but every night, he moved a little closer to the world-class runners. On the last night, he passed them all, and by the next day, he was way ahead of all the other runners. He ended up winning the race, finishing the race in five days, fifteen hours, and four minutes, and breaking the race record by nine hours. Young said that during the race he imagined he was chasing sheep and trying to outrun a storm. Clearly, as Young claimed, his work on the sheep farm helped him and played a role in his win.  P6 Young was awarded the first prize of $10,000, but he hadn't even known there was a prize, and he insisted that he hadn't competed in the race for any kind of reward. He ended up giving the money to other runners in the race. The Australian public loved this, and he became a national hero.  P7 He returned the following year to compete in the race again. Despite some injuries, he got seventh place in the race. He received the award for being the most courageous runner in the race. The prize was a new car, but Young claimed that another runner deserved the prize more and he gave the keys to that person. The story is that Young never kept a prize from any of the races he competed in. He always gave it all away.  P8 Young continued to run for the rest of his life. He died in 2003 at the age of eighty- one.

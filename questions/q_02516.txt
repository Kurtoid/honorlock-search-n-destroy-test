Customers and regulators around the world are increasingly challenging companies to find new ways to deal with plastic waste. For instance, the European Union recently voted to ban a range of single-use plastics such as cutlery, plates, and straws from member states by the year 2021. China halted the import of plastic waste from foreign countries, which could displace as much as 111 million tons of plastic waste by 2030.   On a more local level, some cities such as Chicago have passed legislation that imposes fees on consumers for using plastic bags. In addition to regulatory forces, non-governmental organizations such as Greenpeace call for abandoning single-use plastics that pollute the world's oceans to the tune of 8 million metric tons annually. Given these recent developments, it is safe to say that many societies around the world increasingly demand more sustainable business practices.   Many companies proactively respond to these societal concerns by adopting environmentally sustainable business models. The large U.S. grocery chain, Kroger, announced plans to eliminate plastic shopping bags by 2025. Other retailers even go a step further in their efforts to reduce plastic waste. For instance, Walmart plans to eliminate all non-recyclable packaging materials from its stores. This would make Walmart a "zero waste" store in their U.S. operations by 2025. Walmart has already made significant strides towards this goal by diverting 81% of its U.S. waste away from landfill and incinerations in 2018.   In addition to banning plastic waste, some companies experiment with innovative ways to reduce plastic use altogether. For instance, Starbucks invested millions of dollars to invent and design a straw-less lid to replace plastic straws by 2020. The coffee chain anticipates that this change will eliminate 1 billion straws annually. Similarly, Burger King rolled out biodegradable drinking straws in a shift away from plastic. Other companies, such as Hyatt, now instruct employees to only offer plastic straws to customers when explicitly asked.

(10 points) Multiple choice questions: (only ONE answer is correct, please just write down the No. of the question and your answer in your submission, and do not rewrite the questions)    1-1 Which one is NOT the segment of the product life cycle?  Initialization Start-up Rapid growth Maturation Stabilization or Decline    1-2 When your demand data only has the trend, which forecast model can be directly used?  Moving average Exponential smoothing Holt's method Winters' methods    1-3 Which cost is usually NOT used in evaluating different strategies in aggregate planning?  Regular time costs (i.e., cost of producing one unit of output during regular working hours) Overtime costs and subcontracting costs Holding costs and shortage costs Smoothing costs (e.g., hiring or firing costs)    1-4 Which inventory control model can be used for continuous review?  The basic EOQ model Newsvendor model (Q, R) model with stock-out cost (Q, R) model with service levels    1-5 Which inventory control model can be used for uncertain demand?  The basic EOQ model EOQ with finite production rate Quantity discounts models (Q, R) model with service levels    1-6 Which is NOT the main cause of the bullwhip effect in the supply chain?  Demand forecast updating Order batching Price fluctuations Shortage gaming Channel alignment    1-7 Which is NOT a factor in a queueing model?  Arrival process Service process: distribution of service time Capacity of the queue Number of servers Quality of service    1-8 Which one about Materials Requirement Planning (MRP) is FALSE?  MRP starts with the Master Production Schedule. MRP computes production schedules for all levels based on forecasts of sales of end items. Subassemblies are pushed to the next level only when needed. MRP ignores demand uncertainty, supply uncertainty, and internal uncertainties that arise in the manufacturing process.    1-9 Which one about Just-in-Time (JIT) is FALSE?  The production of JIT at one level only happens when initiated by a request at the higher level. JIT seeks to deliver the right amount of product at the right time. JIT reduces inventories to a minimum. JIT results in decreased worker idle time.    1-10 Which one is TRUE about critical activities and the critical path of a project:  The shortest path is known as the critical path. The length of the critical path is the maximum completion time of the project. A delay in a critical activity results in a delay in the project. A delay in a noncritical activity will delay the project.

Problem Two Recommended Time: 30 minutes Points: 25 Anne buys a house in a residential neighborhood.  About a year after she moves in, her retired neighbor, Betty, decides to start an "urban garden" in a vacant lot next door to Anne's house.  She grows a variety of vegetables using only organic methods, and sells them to people at the local farmers market and to locally owned stores.   Her vegetables are very popular because they are less expensive than other organic produce that comes from farther away.  But Anne sues her for nuisance, claiming the "urban garden" interferes with her use and enjoyment of her property:  for one thing, the vegetables attract rabbits, who, true to their reputation, breed at a ferocious rate and invade Anne's flower beds, chewing and tearing everything up.   And the rabbits, in turn, attract other creatures:   Anne, who has small dogs, is pretty sure she saw a coyote hanging around her garage one night licking its chops.    Betty, however, responds that her garden benefits the community and is much better than a vacant, overgrown lot.  She says it prevents urban blight and crime, and will make property values go up.  She challenges Anne to show her a single example of someone setting up a meth lab in a zucchini patch.      In hearing Anne's suit, how would a court apply the Restatement's balancing test to determine whether the garden was a nuisance? Please complete the answer to this questions, submit your answer, and exit PART ONE of the exam. When you are ready to begin PART TWO, you may. However, remember this is the only break in your exam.

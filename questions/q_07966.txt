Solve the problem.The distance it takes to stop a car varies directly as the square of the speed of the car. If it takes 112 feet for a car traveling at 40 miles per hour to stop, what distance is required for a speed of 63 miles per hour? Round to the nearest hundredth.
In this question, n! denote the factorial of n, where n is any non-negative integer. Consider the trailing zeros of factorials in binary representation. For example, in binary representation, 110! = 1*10*11*100*101*110=1011010000, which has four trailing zeros. This corresponds to 6!=1*2*3*4*5*6=720 in decimal representation.   In binary representation, the number of trailing zeros of   is []

Question 2 - Spreadsheets To support the Gr12's, a talent show has been arranged and you've been tasked to finalise a spreadsheet to help keep track of ticket sales. Open the 2TicketSales spreadsheet and work in the Tickets worksheet.     2.1   Locate the comment in cell A1. Carry out the instruction in this comment and then delete the comment.   (2)     2.2   Format cells A8:C8 to appear as follows (do not change any colours): Right-click on this button and select the "Open link in new tab" option   (3)     2.3   Apply conditional formatting to cells B10:B54 (Code) so that those cells containing the same code as another learner will be formatted differently ('stand out') from the other cells in this column. You can choose your own formatting style.   (2)     2.4   Insert a COUNT function in cell H2 to determine the number of learners in the worksheet.   (1)     2.5   Insert a function in cell H3 to determine the most common number of tickets issued to a learner (column D).   (2)     2.6   The number of tickets sold in each of the three categories are stored in columns F - H. The total value of all the tickets sold by each learner is stored in column I. The tickets are all the same price. Insert a formula in cell H4 to calculate the price of a single ticket.   (3)     2.7   The dates on which the tickets were issued to learners are stored in column E. Insert a function in cell H5 to determine the earliest date on which tickets were issued.   (2)     2.8   Insert a counting function in cell H6 to determine the number of Grade 9 learners who sold more than R100 worth of tickets in total. Tip: You can use the existing named ranges Grades and TotalValue.   (5)     2.9   Change the function in cell K4 so that it calculates the total value of tickets sold by the Grade 10 learners. Ensure that the function can be copied to cells K5:K6 to calculate the total values of tickets sold by the Grade 11 and Grade 12 learners, without making any changes to the function at all.   (2)     2.10   Insert a function in cell Q3 to determine the second highest number of total tickets sold by a Gr12 learner (columns F - H). Use the method of 'building blocks' to obtain the answer in two steps as follows: Step 1:  Modify the function in column R, so that it only calculates the number of tickets sold by each of the Gr12 learners. Step 2:  Insert the LARGE function in cell Q3 to calculate the second highest value obtained in Step 1.   (4)     2.11   Pizzas will be bought for all the learners to share. No more than 4 learners will share a pizza. Insert a rounding function in cell Q6 to calculate the least number of (whole) pizzas that must be bought.   (3)     2.12   The learners' surnames and first names are stored in column A in this format: surname, first name. Each learner is allocated a code as follows:      The last 3 letters of the learner's first name, in upper case, followed by the number of tickets that were issued to the learner (column D).      Insert a function in cell B14 to determine the code of Healey, Richard.   (5)     2.13   Learners are awarded a certain number of 'stars', according to the total value of the tickets that they sold (column I). The table which relates the value of tickets sold to the number of stars awarded, is stored in the Stars worksheet. Insert a function in cell J12 to calculate the number of stars awarded to Akhona, Bulelwa.   (4)     2.14   The last date on which tickets were issued to any learner (column E) was 8 May. The date on which ticket money was due by a learner (column K) is calculated as follows:      If the tickets were issued in April or earlier, the money was due 14 days after the date of issue. If the tickets were issued in May, the money was due on the date stored in cell K9.      Insert an IF function in cell K13 to determine the date on which ticket money was due by Hill, Samantha. The function must work correctly if it is copied to other cells in this column. Tip: Make use of the Month function.   (6)     2.15   Now work in the Chart worksheet, which contains a chart showing the percentage of learners in each grade.    Fill only the Gr12 slice with the image 2Microphone stored in your exam folder. Ensure that the outside border of the chart has rounded corners. Make further changes as needed so that the chart appears as shown below (do not change any colours).     Right-click on this button and select the "Open link in new tab" option Note:  A screenshot of what your chart should look like is included in the worksheet.   (6)     Save the spreadsheet and close it.  Upload your saved version of 2TicketSales.xlsx under Question 2 in the UPLOAD Quiz (NO PDF FILES)   [50]

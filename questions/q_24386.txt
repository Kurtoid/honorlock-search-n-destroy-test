The reactant concentration in a zero-order reaction was 0.900M after 130s and 0.350M after 335s.  What is the rate constant for this reaction? Zero-Order:                         First-Order:                         Second-Order: rate = k                                 rate = k[A]                            rate = k[A]2 [A] = -kt + [A]0                     ln[A] = -kt + ln[A]0

Assume you have a method named randInt that returns a random integer, you can just call it in your code without any class name. Write a Java program that will run two separate threads which will each get 50 random integers and put them in the same ArrayList, so that when both threads are run there will be 100 random integers in the ArrayList. Make sure the threads synchronize properly so that no conflicts arise while they are adding to the ArrayList. Enter your code directly in the textbox, you are not allowed to use an IDE or editor for this. Use a monospace font if possible and use spaces for correct indentation. Use Java comments (//) to indicate when you are starting a new class and to explain anything else about your code.

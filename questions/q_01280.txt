Blood type is determined by two genes.  At least 1 dominant H gene allele is needed to build the H antigen: HH or Hh = H antigen, i.e., normal; hh = no H antigen, i.e., Bombay If an individual has the H antigen (i.e., is not Bombay), the I gene then determines blood type O, blood type A, blood type B or blood type AB (IAIA or IAi = blood type A; IBIB or IBi= blood type B; IAIB = blood type AB; ii = blood type O).                             H gene                                                                I gene              HH or Hh = H antigen; hh = Bombay)                                  (ii = blood type O)                                                                                IAIB = type AB; IAIA or IAi = type A; IBIB or IBi = type B)                         Bombay                          -                          H antigen                                  -                   blood types A, B, or AB In the cross HhIBi and Hhii, what is the probability of a child with blood type O?

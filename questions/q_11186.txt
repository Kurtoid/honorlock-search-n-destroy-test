DIRECTIONS: Choose the correct answer for each question. Mystery Sisters [A] Aubrey Lumpkin got the biggest surprise of her young life when her adoptive American parents, Lisa and Gene, told her that she had a sister. It was even more surprising when they told her that she had met her sister before! [B] In fact, Aubrey and her sister had lived and played together at the same orphanage1 in Shenzhen, China for several years but did not know that they were sisters. The orphanage was also unaware that the two young girls were related. When the Lumpkins adopted Aubrey at the age of six, they did not know about the other girl and thus did not realize that they were actually separating two sisters. [C] Several years later, while surfing the Internet, Lisa Lumpkin came across a photo of a young girl who looked so much like Aubrey that she got an intense shock. The similarity in appearance was too great to be just a coincidence. Lisa concluded that the girl in the photo and her adopted daughter Aubrey must be sisters. To her surprise, after some research, she traced this girl back to Aubrey's orphanage. The Lumpkins' immediately contacted the orphanage to arrange for a DNA test.2 When the results were released, Lisa's guess was confirmed. The two girls were most certainly sisters. [D] At this point, the Lumpkins' next step was obvious to them. They decided to adopt Aubrey's sister as well. After going through a lengthy adoption process once again, the Lumpkins were finally able to become the girl's parents. After giving her the name Avery, they flew her to the United States and reunited her with Aubrey.[E] The Lumpkins have admitted that communication between the two girls has been a challenge. Because Avery was raised in China until the age of 13, her English skills were very weak when she arrived in the United States. Similarly, because Aubrey has lived with the Lumpkins since the age of six, she is not able to speak Chinese. [F] Despite this, the two girls are always excited to be around one another and also provide support to each other. Although the girls get along well with the Lumpkins' other children, Aubrey and Avery's relationship is a special one. They are truly thankful for what their adoptive mother accidentally found on the Internet.1 An orphanage is a place that takes care of children without parents.2 A DNA test shows whether two people are biologically related.What is the passage mainly about?

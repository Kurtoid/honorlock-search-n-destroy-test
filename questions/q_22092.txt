When I began working from home at 23, I soon realized that the potential harm wasn't limited to my sleep schedule or my mood. Even if I successfully made myself a disciplined, 9-to-5 worker bee, I was far removed from the structure of my career itself. For the first few years, I had an inexpensive apartment in a small town that I loved, but it was far away from New York City, the country's fashion capital. I wasn't meeting anyone else who did similar work, wasn't being invited to anything, wasn't getting introduced to any friends of friends. If I had wanted or needed a new job, completely changing careers would probably have been easier than getting another gig in my field with the experience I'd accrued at home.     Moving to New York a few years into the job helped, but it didn't totally solve the problem--I was still the girl on her laptop in her bedroom, trying to make people from Twitter like me enough to meet a stranger for an after-hours drink. After you've left the ready-made social environment of school, an office is a natural place to look for new people who share your interests and outlook. But with no place to go to but just as many professional obligations, people working from home might have the flexibility to do everything except make new friends.  What problem does moving to New York NOT solve for the author?

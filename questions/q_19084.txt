Read this passage and answer the question that follows.      The Roman genius for organization and problem solving is among its most significant cultural legacies. The Romans were superb engineers. Their roads, bridges, baths, aqueducts, theaters, forums, walls, palaces, and monuments can be found in more than thirty modern nations. These feats of engineering are massive in scale, technically sophisticated, extraordinarily practical, and built with a meticulous attention to the craft of surveying.      The road system they put in place across Europe is, in part, still in use today. The Romans built bridges and aqueducts that crossed rivers and valleys and carried fresh water to houses and public baths. Roman town architecture was also eminently practical. Great amphitheaters like the Colosseum in Rome were designed to accommodate vast crowds and to let them enter and exit quickly and efficiently. The seating area of the Colosseum accommodated over 50,000 people, each of whom had a clear view of the arena. Today' s sports fans attend football games and soccer matches at similarly sized stadiums that owe much to their Roman antecedents.      Romans' love for the efficient and practical is also seen in their political structure. The Romans invented the field of civil law which became the foundation of legal systems in many Western countries. The Romans were also responsible for the idea of natural law. Natural law postulated a set of rights that became the basis for the "inalienable rights" promised by the framers of the American Declaration of Independence many centuries later.      The idea of civility in social conduct and civilized discourse in public life is another of Rome' s cultural legacies. But perhaps the Romans' greatest impact was in their language, Latin, which is the ancestor language for the Romance languages--Italian, Spanish, and French all descend from it. And although English is Germanic in root, it nonetheless contains thousands of Latin loan words, so much so that studying Latin in school can provide the basis for developing an extensive English vocabulary. And finally, the Romans, who inherited their alphabet from the Greeks but who also made changes in it, left in the Roman alphabet an even more pervasive cultural legacy. --adapted from Benton and DiYanni, Arts and Culture, pp. 98, 110The purpose of this selection is to

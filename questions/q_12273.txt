After years of work for corporations, the firm decided that ERISA was no longer profitable and instead it believe that such practice brought much malpractice risk to the firm.  Thus, the firm informed the five ERISA lawyers that they were being fired.  The firm followed its partnership agreement with the two partners and all employment law with the three associates and it even helped these individuals set up their own firm.  All ERISA clients were informed about this decision and all of them chose to transfer all of the client files of past and present cases to the new small firm.  One year after the discharge of the five lawyers, a plaintiff approached the law firm to represent him in a suit against a client formerly represented by the ERISA section.  Part of the lawsuit would involve issues addressed when the law firm had an ERISA section for this former client.  No one in the firm had worked on that client and the firm possessed no confidential information about the client.  The law firm accepted the case. Was it proper to accept the representation of the plaintiff against the firm's former client?

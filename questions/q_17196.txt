Load the RadioButtons on the form into the array in the form Load event. Code the Load Data button to load the contents of the ClientCharges.txt file (found in the bindebug folder) into the ListBox. While loading, count the number of clients and keep a running total of the charges.  Do not read through the ListBox - do this while loading from the file.   Capture the selection made for a radio button in the RadioButtons' CheckedChanged event and store it in a variable for use in the btnShow code. Code the btnClear Click event to clear the ListBox and to clear the selections made for the RadioButtons. Clear any calculated statistical values. Use the array of RadioButton objects to clear the selection. Code the btnShow Click event to show the desired statistical value based on the captured selection made for the radio buttons. Display the statistic information in a MessageBox.  Validate that data has been loaded into the ListBox before attempting to show an analysis choice. Validate that a selection was made for the RadioButtons (use the captured value - do not recheck all radio buttons). Use a Select Case structure to set the statistics message to be displayed.

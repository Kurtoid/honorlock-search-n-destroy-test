After reading the paragraphs below, answer the questions that follow.Over the next several decades, world population growth will necessitate as much as a 60% increase in food production, primarily in developing countries. These countries are often the most seriously affected by drought and salinity. Even if irrigation water is available, flooding fields with irrigation water leads to the gradual accumulation of sodium ions and other salts in the soil.To respond to this growing problem, scientists at the University of Connecticut have genetically engineered a plant that can survive in salty soil and withstand extended drought conditions. The new transgenic plant contains a gene for an ion pump. Salt ions are transported from the soil and stored in vacuoles in the cytoplasm. The enhanced uptake of ions into their vacuoles in turn improves water retention in the transgenic plants and their resistance to drought. The concentration of solutes inside and outside plant cells affects the direction of water movement through osmosis.The researchers found that the salt concentration in the cells of the new transgenic plants was significantly higher than in wild plants used as a control. In addition, the transgenic plants survived longer when deprived of water.The experimental plants were more drought resistant because

PART E Serial Dilution You received a broth culture labeled "E" with an original concentration of 5.3 x10  cfu/ml.   Fill in the 10 blanks/questions in the text box (some illustrated in the picture, some listed as questions below)to reflect your knowledge of serial dilutions. The scheme uses standard 1/10th dilutions like we used in class.     For 1-3 write the dilution or dilution factor for each tube For 4-6 write the final dilution factor for each plate 7. How much liquid did you transfer to each 9ml dilution blank?      8. How much liquid did you transfer from dilution blanks to the plates?      9. Which plate do you predict will yield countable results (A, B, or C)?      10. How many colonies will grow on the plate chosen in question 9?

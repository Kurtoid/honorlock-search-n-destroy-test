Problem 3 An athlete is using an exercise machine as shown.  The handle where the athlete pulls is attached to a cable that wraps around two pulleys before reaching an 80 lb weight.  At the position shown, where the weight is slowly being lifted, determine the reactions at points E and F.  A, C and F are pinned connections whereas E is a built-in support.          For all components, give scalar values with units involving lbs and ft.  For any component of reaction that does not exist at a given support, enter 0. Ex = [Ex] Ey = [Ey] ME = [M_E] Fx = [Fx] Fy = [Fy] MF = [M_F]

You are shown DNA nucleotide base pairing to the right.  While you certainly aren't expected to have the chemical structure of each nucleotide memorized, you should be able to determine which nucleotide is which based  on your knowledge of base-pairing, the number of hydrogen bonds formed between the two pairs of nucleotides, and purines vs. pyrimidines.  With that in mind, label each DNA nucleotide with the symbol (A for adenine, T for thymine, C for cytosine, or G for guanine).  (1 point each)     1 (yellow)- [DNA1]                2 (pink)- [DNA2]                  (1)                                   (2)                            (3)                                (4)     3 (blue)- [DNA3]            4 (green)-[DNA4]

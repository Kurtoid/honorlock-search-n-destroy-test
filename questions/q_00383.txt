Fill in each blank with correct choice within each set of parentheses: In the acronym XPS, the P stands for (photoelectron / proton / power) [1].  This technique irradiates a sample with (hard / soft) [2] X-rays, which knocks off electrons of lower atomic (incident / kinetic / binding) [3] energy. The value that is desired is the binding energy because it is a characteristic of each element, and thus provides chemical information. But it is not directly measured.  It is obtained from the difference between the incident energy, that of the X-ray source, and the kinetic energy, measured from the (drag / velocity / acceleration) [4] of the released electrons that travel through hemispherical metal plates.  The reason this is a surface analysis technique is because the escape depth of the electrons is short, where the electrons lose energy due to (elastic / inelastic) [5] scattering collisions with other matter in their path.  Therefore, only elements in the uppermost one hundred (angstroms / nanometers / microns / millimeters) [6] are seen in the spectrum. Because the peak intensities are not directly related to the electron occupancy of orbitals, (fudge / transition / sensitivity) [7] factors must be used to make the technique semi-quantitative with respect to measuring elemental composition. This leads to the other name of the technique, given the acronym (ECSA / EASC / ESCA / SCEA / AESC) [8].  In high resolution XPS, one can gain information about the bonding environment of that specific element because the binding energies become higher for an atom that has a bonding environment with a (lower / higher) [9] oxidation state. For example, in the case of organic polymers, one can distinguish between an ester and an ether, where the latter functional group will have a (lower / higher) [10] binding energy.  Depth profiling can be done in XPS by varying the (take-on / take-off  / rip-off / scattering) [11] angle to the detector, which in turn varies the escape path length. To get more surface sensitivity (shallowest depth measurement), one should use a (smaller / larger) [12] emission angle (angle between surface and detector).  Very low emission angles are referred to as (phasing / browsing / grazing / skimming) [13] incidence measurements.

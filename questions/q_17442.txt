Does beta-carotene protect against cancer?Beta-carotene: Does it or doesn't it? Beta-carotene supplements had been thought to protect against cancer, but a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute suggests that it does not. The study was conducted with 39,000 women aged 45 and up. These women were randomly assigned to receive a beta-carotene supplement or a placebo, and their health was studied over time. There was no evidence that taking the beta-carotene supplement affected their cancer rates.  What is the independent variable? And, what is the dependent variable?

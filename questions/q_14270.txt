What is the primary reason a diabetic client is encouraged to exercise routinely?
Gyres are important current effects found in all of the oceans. As this question has multiple parts (A, B, C,...) make sure you answer each part separately on a separate line and label each part (A, B, C,...). (General names of currents are true for any gyre. Specific names are only valid for a particular gyre. For example, the specific current on the western side of the North Atlantic gyre is the Gulf Stream. There are 3 other specific currents, on the northern, eastern, and southern sides of the North Atlantic gyre.) A) What are the general names for the four currents in a gyre? B) What are the 4 specific currents' names in the North Atlantic gyre?  C) What winds drive gyres and what general gyre currents are driven by those winds? D) Which of the general gyre currents tends to warm continents and which tends to cool continents? Why? E) What causes the "hill" at the center of gyre to form (and keeps it there) and what causes it to stop growing? F) What is western intensification and what effect does it have on the "hill"?
Please use the following patient vignette to answer questions 15 and 16. A 52-year-old woman is evaluated because of sporadic headaches that have occurred once or twice monthly for the past 20 years.  Her headaches typically start in the afternoon, worsen in the evening and improve with sleep.  She describes the pain as tightness in the occipital and temporal regions with moderate intensity.  The patient also reports neck stiffness without nausea or sensitivity to light.  She uses over-the-counter acetaminophen as needed, with partial relief of symptoms.  She takes no other medications, and past medical history is unremarkable.   On physical examination, vital signs are normal.  Paraspinal cervical muscles show tenderness but normal range of motion.  Neurologic examination is within normal limits. 15. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Below is a small tree with two clades, A and B. All sequences with names ending in A are in clade A and all sequences with names ending in B are in clade B. Clades A and B are paralogs. Next to the tree is a short multiple sequence alignment (MSA) arranged in the order of the tree so that each sequence corresponds to its adjacent leaf (the first sequence is for CAT_A, the second for DOG_A, etc). Some sites are conserved, some are changing in physicochemical amino acid property from one clade to the other, and some are changing in amino acid but the property is conserved. Which site has paralog-specific amino acid conservation and conserved physicochemical property across the tree?
Which cells display CD4 proteins and interact with MHC Class II antigens?

For the bonus, as always, describe something you learned from this unit that goes beyond the test. I am looking for quality, not quantity (i.e. telling me in detail one unique fact versus rattling off several unrelated facts). You can make up a total of 3 points.
Determine the limiting reactant (LR) and the mass (in g) of nitrogen that can be formed from 50.0 g N2O4 and 45.0 g N2H4. Some possibly useful molar masses are as follows: N2O4 = 92.02 g/mol, N2H4 = 32.05 g/mol.

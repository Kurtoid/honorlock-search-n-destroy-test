Shinzo Sato is a 2020 graduate of Georgia Tech who recently started a job at CyberCloud in Charlotte, North Carolina. Shinzo received an employee manual on the first day of work at the IT support call center, which is unionized. Being a detail-oriented Georgia Tech graduate, Shinzo reads the entire manual. Shinzo learns from the manual that the company promises not to read any emails accessed at work that originate in an account other than the official work account. The manual is explicit that the company will monitor all emails in a person's official work account. Based on these statements in the manual, Shinzo regularly checks his personal email accounts at work. After a month with CyberCloud, Shinzo realizes that the company is failing to pay its workers overtime as required by federal law. After this discovery, the topics of Shinzo's personal emails change from general updates to complaints about working conditions at CyberCloud. After two months of working for CyberCloud, Shinzo is fired. Shinzo believes that his personal emails led to his termination. If Shinzo is correct, does Shinzo have a strong case that he should not have been fired?

What is a criticisms of each definition of poverty? In "Traps, Pitfalls, and Unexpected Cliffs on the Path out of Poverty," Prenovost and Youngblood argue that increases in household income for those receiving government benefits can have several significant impacts on individuals/families in the "gray area." List and explain two of the three.   (2) Explain the three measures of poverty by the used by the U.S. Census Bureau. Which are absolute measures and which are relative measures? Explain. How do these measures relate to the stratification system of "social class"? What is the difference between stratification and inequality?   (3) What is the concept of the self-made myth? How does this relate to the concepts of social class and the American dream? How might both of these concepts combine to affect our ideas about poverty and social mobility? Connect this discussion with at least one of the readings on this subject.

Sickle cell anemia is an incompletely dominant genetic disorder caused by a point mutation in DNA resulting in abnormal red blood cells.  The genotypes that relate to this condition are as follows: Carriers for sickle cell anemia (ESEN) are mildly sick. Individuals with sickle cell anemia (ESES) have the full-blown disease. Individuals  that are normal (ENEN) have normal red blood cells that are biconcave.  The agarose gel was loaded as shown below?  What is the genotype of Patient #1? A = Normal hemoglobin DNA - low molecular weight band (ENEN) B = Sickle cell anemia DNA     - high molecular weight band (ESES) C= Sickle cell carrier DNA       - high & low molecular weight bands (ESEN) D = Patient #1 DNA  ?? E = Patient #2 DNA  ??                                                                        A         B         C        D         E

30     The circuit shown consists of two resistors of resistances 10 k and 50 k and a component Y.               A 6.0 V supply is provided. The electric potential of the bottom wire is 0 V.       Right click to open image in a separate tab.          The current in component Y is negligible.               What is the electric potential at junction X?     (1)                A       1.0 V                       B      1.2 V                  C         4.8 V                D           5.0 V

This is the beginning of the short answer portion of Midterm 2 Glucose transport across membranes can occur in a variety of ways. Based on the diagram shown below, indicate:  A. What kind of transport would be involved in this process? (1 point) B. Give an example of a type of transporter that can move glucose under these conditions (for example, a K+ voltage- gated channel, a Ca2+ ATPase, etc ) (2 point) C. Describe any other conditions that are required for this transport to occur. For example, it requires a certain concentration gradient, the presence of another transporter, the presence of another molecule, etc. (3 points)

Look at the picture below and answer the following question. Rising temperatures in the arctic cause parts of the ice covering the ocean to melt, which exposes the darker colored water below. Darker colors absorb more heat, which in turn causes more melting. This type of disruptive feedback process is also called a _____?

Part A. Below is a gymnosperm seed showing the different 'layers'. Label each layer in terms of what it is, where it came from, and indicate the ploidy of the tissues.       Part B. In cycads, a typical gymnosperm, cells of the sporophyte have 20 chromosomes within each nucleus. Based on this information, and referencing the ploidy in your drawing, indicate how many chromosomes would be present within the following tissues:       Seed coat: Endosperm:  Embryo:

A 56-year-old African American woman presented with several month's history of fatigue, constipation, depression, dyspnea, and a recent episode of syncope. History revealed a 70-lb. weight loss, non-healing leg ulcers, and nodules on her wrists and ankles over the last 4 years.  Her serum calcium was 18.9 mg/dL (RR: 8.5-10.2 mg/dL). A chest x-ray (see "A") shows bilateral hilar adenopathy. A biopsy of her one of her skin nodules is shown (See "B") along with two higher-power inserts. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her hypercalcemia?          A  Excessive parathyroid hormone production    B  Excessive ICAM-1 production by macrophages    C  Increased fractional calcium GI absorption    D  Local Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and TNF effects    E  Unregulated Vitamin D production by macrophages

This quiz involves a gas that follows the equation of state: V = (RT/P) + aTP where a = -3E-13  The gas has a molecular mass of 120 g/mol and an ideal gas, constant pressure heat capacity of 29.1 J/mol K. The gas enters a turbine at Tin = 500 K, Pin = 1,500,000 Pa and exits the turbine at Tout = 375 K, Pout = 528,874 Pa. The formula to calculate the change in molar entropy of an ideal gas is:

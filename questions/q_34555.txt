A mixture of 1.374 g of H2 and 70.31 g of Br2 is heated in a 2.00 L vessel at 700 K. These substances react as follows: H2(g) + Br2(g) = 2 HBr(g)   At equilibrium the vessel is found to contain 0.566 g of H2. The molar mass are: H2 (2.016 g/mol), Br2 (159.81 g/mol), and HBr (80.91 g/mol). Calculate Kc.

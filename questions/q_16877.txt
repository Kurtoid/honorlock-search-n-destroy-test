Your childhood friend, Sally, just inherited a dormant strawberry farm from her grandmother. Sally's goal is to plant the best tasting organic strawberry in the Tampa area. She wants to compare three types of strawberries (i.e., Sweet Charlies, Stargazer Perennials, and Seascape Delights) and two types of organic food (i.e., 50% bone meal and 100% bone meal). She knows that you are at UF and taking Research Methods so she asks you to design a study, compute the statistical analyses, and interpret the findings in determining the best tasting organic strawberry for her farm.       A. List the necessary steps involved in conducting this study including the experimental design. B. Do as complete statistical analysis as possible, and label your work.

[Problem Statement] Design a synchronous counter that will display every other digit of your VID, beginning with the first digit.  You may ignore any repeated values within your VID. You may ignore ANY value within your VID that is greater than 7. For example, if your VID is 033476841, the counter would display every other digit (ignoring values greater than 7), or "0-3-7-1".  As a second example, if your VID is 919343591, the counter would display every other digit (ignoring repeated digits AND digits greater than 7), or "4-5-1". Again, repeated values and values greater than 7 can be ignored for this exercise. [Requirements] 1.) Begin by typing your name and VID in the space below. 2.) Describe the state diagram in the space below. Explain the states of your counter, based on your VID and the directions above.  Unused states can be don't cares. 3.) In the space below, include a truth table that indicates the present state, next state, and all J/K flip-flop inputs based on each state transition. Below the table, include typed equations for each flip-flop input.  You may solve for each J and K input equation on your own scratch paper.  Your scratch paper does not need to be turned in. 4.) Build your counter in Multisim.  Include a very low clock signal (1-10 Hz) and a hex display that will show the output of the counter as it counts. [Submission] Submit the following files to complete your submission: 1.) The work used to create your counter typed in the answer box below. 2.) a Multisim file with your counter design, displaying every other digit of your VID number as described above. Both of these things must be submitted to receive credit for this problem. When you are ready to submit your work, hit "Next".  You will be directed to upload your Multisim file.

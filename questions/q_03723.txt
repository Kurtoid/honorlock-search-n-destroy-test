Radiographs are taken to visualize the chest for any respiratory distress, and in doing so the radiographer must: 1. employ the highest degree of aseptic techniques. 2. use lead protection when possible, and sterilize after each use. 3. wash hands only after the procedure is complete. 4. wrap all items that may have the potential of coming in contact with the newborn. 5. use contact or shadow shielding for patient protection. 6. treat the procedure as a sterile procedure similar to surgery.

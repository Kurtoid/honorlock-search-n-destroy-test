A WWTP utilizing the complete-mix modification of the activated sludge process is located at 1,000 FMSL. The oxygen demand for the facility is 9,625 lb O2/day during the summer months when the maximum wastewater temperature is 84.2 deg Four mechanical aeration devices are to be used and the aerator manufacturer has determined the oxygen transfer to be 2.3 lb O2/hp-hr. Determine the theoretical aerator power (hp) per aerator if the operating DO is 1.8 mg/L. Assume a and b values of 0.75 and 0.95, respectively.    (5 pts) Determine saturation dissolved oxygen concentration of the wastewater (Cw) (unit: mg/L) (5 pts) If Cw is 7.12 mg/L, determine rate of oxygen mass transferred (N) (unit: lb O2/hp-hr) (5 pts) If the rate of oxygen mass transferred is 1.196 lb O2/hp-hr, determine aerator horsepower required (each)? (unit: hp)

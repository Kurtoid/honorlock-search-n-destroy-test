Over an 18 day period, with daily measurements of copper yield from a mine were taken. The company has as a default goal of the 60th percentile being more than 50 tons. From the 18 days, 8 days yielded less than 50 tons. (Remark: No day yielded exactly 50 tons). To test whether the company's goal is upheld you would use

[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).] A 0.75-kg block, starting with a speed of 2.33 m/s, slides 2 m down a frictionless incline, 30 degrees from horizontal.  Once on the horizontal, it encounters friction and stops after 3 m.   a) Find the force of friction acting on the block using mechanical energy and work principles.  Include a labeled sketch (showing the initial and final states you chose as well as the height at which PEg=0), work diagram, and all work.  Enter the size of the force of friction, with units, in the box below. b) Draw and fill in an energy bar chart, where initial is defined as the place where the block starts, on the incline, and final is defined to be when the block is at rest, on the horizontal.  Be sure to use the relative sizes of the bars, as best you can, to show your understanding of this scenario.  You will scan the energy bar chart, as well as your work for part a, and submit it immediately following the quiz.

Question 4                                                                                                                                                                                        [10]     Read the case study and answer the following questions:             It's estimated that only 5% of South African households recycle paper. Recycling paper in South Africa does not save trees. This is because the trees are specially farmed for the purpose of papermaking. For the manufacture of paper and timber products, trees are sustainably planted, grown and harvested in cycles - making paper a renewable resource. In South Africa, indigenous trees from natural forests are never used for papermaking. The reason why paper recycling is so important in South Africa is because of the overall impact on the environment of greenhouse gasses and managing paper as a sustainable resource.   Recycled paper fiber is an important raw material in the production of packaging and tissue products. Some 65% of the country's paper mills depend on recycled fiber and a number of them use it as their only fiber source. Currently thousands of tonnes of good quality, recyclable paper are going to landfill every year. This paper degrades along with other food waste, adding to the levels of greenhouse gases in the air we breathe. In some cases, paper is incinerated, also causing air pollution. By recycling paper, the carbon (originally stored by trees in the wood fiber) remains 'locked up' - and out of the atmosphere - for longer. It extends the life of landfills   The collection, sorting and processing of recyclables plays a vital role in formal and informal job creation. An informal collector could start the day without a cent in his pocket and by the end of the day have enough money for an evening meal for his family.

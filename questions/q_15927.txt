Question 1 - Data Exploration (20 Points) A. Use appropriate graphical analytics techniques to evaluate the nature of the change time series data (*-Pct for each of the four time series) as well as their respective first and second differences. B. On the first difference of each change time series, fit a different kind of exploratory modelling technique from Unit 1 (your choice but all three must differ).

Citing the relevant theory provided in the description of the data, comment on the potential viability of the following modeling techniques if applied to the first difference of the data: ARIMA, ARIMA-GARCH, Unrestricted VAR, Sine-Cosine Harmonic.

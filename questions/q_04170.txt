Shemp and Fine & Howard overcame the initial "bump in the road" described in Question 26 above. Shemp's broker created a Letter of Intent for presentation to Fine & Howard. (Assume that the LOI was typical/customary in form and content.) Fine & Howard and Shemp signed the LOI, and Fine & Howard's lawyers went to work on negotiating a Sale and Purchase Contract. Fine & Howard spent a good deal of money on its lawyers' work. Unfortunately the deal permanently "cratered" before the 'SPC' was signed.

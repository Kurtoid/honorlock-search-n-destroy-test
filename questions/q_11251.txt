One spot on the microarray contains sequences unique to the gene for RNA polymerase. One spot contains sequences unique to the skeletal muscle myosin gene. Which spot would be expected to contain the RNA polymerase gene sequences? The following microarray data are shown for four human genes. Two samples were hybridized to the microarray in this experiment. One sample was cDNA generated from mRNA of a tissue culture cell line derived from a B-cell leukemia. The other sample was cDNA generated from normal, mature neural tissue.  Red means hybridization to cancerous B-cell cDNA. Green means hybridization to normal neural cell cDNA. Yellow means hybridization to both cDNA types. Blank means hybridization to neither cell's cDNA.

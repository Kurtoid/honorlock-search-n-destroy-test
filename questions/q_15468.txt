Device Family: MAX 10 (DA/DF/DC/SA/SC)Device: 10M02SCU169C8G Design (directly implement, i.e., do not simplify or manipulate the equations), construct, and demonstrate circuits that meets the following specifications. Use the switch, LED, and resistors needed to create the necessary inputs and outputs for your demonstration. Part 1  Use only your PLD, i.e., no 74'xxx chips. In Quartus, use only gates available from 74HC02 "NOR" chips (with any type gate that can be made using that chip), but use the minimum number of gates needed. A picture of a 74'02 chip is available below. This same circuit will be built in Part 2 with 74HC02 chip(s).   Inputs: A(L), and B, C; for B and C, choose the "best" activation-level  Outputs: Z(L) [Note that Z below and Y in Part 2 are the same equation!] Equations:

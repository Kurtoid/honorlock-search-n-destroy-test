Answer all of the following questions below. Although there is not a specific length requirement, please make sure that you have answered the question to the best of your ability. You can voice your opinion in these questions, but they need to be backed up by content that was covered in class.  You will be graded on both content and grammar.  1. Based on what you have learned in chapter 8 and 9 from book readings, discussions and other additional course materials, how do you think consumer spending changed in the last month given that another round of stimulus payments were issued to most US consumers? 2. Based on your answer, how would this then effect the growth or decline in the economy in the future(discuss the steps in chapter 9 the US economy would potentially go through). Be detailed. 3. Then what potential effect would this have on GDP and unemployment given your previous answers?

In Vivek Pai's paper on the Flash webserver, the authors evaluated several webserver designs using two traces - the Owlnet trace, whose dataset size was 100MB, and the CS trace, whose dataset size was 7.8GB. The webservers they compared include Flash (which followed the AMPED model), SPED (the Zeus single-process event-driven server), MT (a multi-threaded webserver), MP (a multi-process webserver, Apache (an unoptimized Apache webserver).  The tests were performed using a 333MHz PentiumII CPU with 128 MB of memory and multiple 100 Mbit/s Ethernet interfaces.  Give the correct answer to the following questions:1. In the event of the CS trace, which of the following will perform better:     a.    Flash vs. MT [a]     b.    Flash vs. MP [b]     c.    Flash vs. SPED [c]     d.    SPED vs. MT [d]     e.    MT vs. MP [e]2. In the event of the Owlnet trace, which of the following will perform better:     f.     Flash vs. MT [f]     g.    Flash vs. MP [g]     h.    SPED vs. MT [h]     i.     MT vs. MP [i]     j.     MP vs. Apache [j]3. Without modifying the implementation described in the paper, when running on a more recent quad-core platform with 12GB of memory, which one would you expect to perform better:     k.    Flash vs. MT [k]     l.   MT vs. MP [l]

Read the following scenario and answer the question below. Human activities, including fossil fuel combustion, farming, and deforestation, are known to increase the levels of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides in our atmosphere. Measurable warming of Earth due to these greenhouse gases can alter ecosystem dynamics. In addition to the direct climatic effects on organisms within biomes, warming can lower levels of sea ice and increase precipitation in Arctic areas. Global warming can also melt permafrost in the tundra and increase sea surface temperatures, which could increase the intensity of hurricanes in vulnerable areas. Within communities, climatic change can shift interdependent species "out of sync," potentially causing indirect loss of species. For example, if pollinators and the plants they pollinate become out of synch, the pollinators may not be able to switch to a different food source, and the plants may not be able to reproduce. Global warming has been hypothesized to cause many plants to flower earlier. If bees search for food earlier in response to this, this would represent ________ within the community.

Suppose Elmer has wealth of $100,000 and utility function U(W) =  [?]W  = the square root of wealth.  Elmer faces the possibility of a loss of $25,000 with probability 2%. a.

Ignoring expenses, what is the largest risk charge an insurer could include in the premium and still sell a policy to Elmer?  In general, what factors affect the size of the risk charge?  (7 points)

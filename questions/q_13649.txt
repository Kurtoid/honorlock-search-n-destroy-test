4.  A car park payment system allows customers to select the number of hours to leave their car in the car park. The customer will get a discount if they enter their frequent parking number correctly. The system calculates and displays the amount the customer must pay. The price of parking, the number of hours the customer can enter, and any discount depend upon the day of the week and the arrival time. The number of hours entered is a whole number. The price per hour is calculated using the price in force at the arrival time. No parking is allowed between Midnight and 08:00. A frequent parking number can be entered for discounted parking. This number consists of 4 digits and a check digit that is calculated using a modulo 11 check digit calculation. A discount of 50% is available for arrival times from 16:00 to Midnight; the discount is 10% at all other arrival times. The modulo 11 check digit calculation for a frequent parking number (4823) can be calculated as follows:    4 8 2 3   x4 x3 x2 x1    = 4x4 + 8x3 + 2x2 + 3x1 = 16 + 24 + 4 + 3 = 25 The check digit is the result of 25 % 11 which is equal to 3   Write a program in Python according to the specifications in 4.1 and 4.2.

Read the following selection titled "Emergency Funds." Then, based on your reading of the selection, choose the most appropriate answer to the question that follows it. You may be asked additional questions about this selection. Emergency Funds "Time and unexpected events [affect us] all." --King Solomon Plan on the unplanned happening to you. It happens to all of us: a car repair, a broken computer, an unplanned visit to the doctor, a friend or relative in desperate need, etc. How will you pay for it? A recent study found that over 60 percent of households could not pay cash for a $400 unexpected expense.8 Could you?  What Is an Emergency Fund? An emergency fund is a cash reserve that's specifically set aside for unplanned expenses or financial emergencies9. Some common examples include car repairs, home repairs, medical bills, and a loss of income. In general, emergency savings can be used for large or small unplanned bills or payments that are not part of your routine monthly expenses and spending.   Why Do I Need an Emergency Fund? Without savings, even a minor financial shock could set you back, and if it turns into debt, it can potentially have a lasting impact.  Research suggests that individuals who struggle to recover from a financial shock have less savings to help protect against a future emergency. They may rely on credit cards or loans, which can lead to debt that's generally harder to pay off. They may also pull from other savings, such as retirement funds, to cover these costs.    How Much Money Should I Keep in My Emergency Fund? There is no magic or "official" amount to keep in an emergency fund, but you can look at your own life to get an idea to start with. How much could you put into a bank account to have for emergencies? Some students and their parents will not have a problem paying for most emergencies, but many students are on their own. What can you save up over time? A common recommendation for graduates with full-time jobs is perhaps three to six months' worth of expenses. This may not be practical for you. A large sampling of students in financial literacy classes recommend approximately $1,000. One thousand dollars can cover a lot of small to medium unexpected expenses, such as last-minute textbooks, computer repair or replacement, car repair, or a prescription or doctor's visit. The emergency fund is best kept separate from other money for living expenses to protect it as emergency money. While you could keep cash, an emergency fund is often best kept in a bank, in order to avoid theft or loss and still have easy access by debit card or ATM. Pizza is not an emergency!

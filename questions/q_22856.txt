Each player creates their own character to play. Dungeons & Dragons is a structured, yet fundamentally open-ended role-playing game. It is normally played indoors with the participants seated around a tabletop. Typically, one player takes on the role of Dungeon Master (DM) while the others each control a single character, representing an individual in a fictional setting.  D&D uses polyhedral (many sided) dice to resolve in-game events.

You are in charge of a project regarding characterization of a novel fungal F1FO ATP synthase, a well known molecular machine that produces chemical energy for cells under oxidative phosphorylation conditions.  This is what you know about this enzyme complex: 1) It is recalcitrant to protein crystallization efforts (can't get crystals of this complex) 2)  Enzyme activity can be detected using semi-purified proteoliposomes containing these complexes and providing an artificially induced chemiosmotic gradient. 3) Treatment of semi-purified proteoliposomes with the detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO) activates ATP hydrolysis >15-fold.    4) Western blots have been performed using polyclonal antibodies against every individual subunit that is normally found in F1FO subunits...and ONLY the beta subunit appears to be conserved using this technique.   Describe multiple approaches you would take to investigate the structure and function of this enzyme complex in energy generation under respiratory conditions and what your predicted results would be, provide strengths and weaknesses for approaches when possible.

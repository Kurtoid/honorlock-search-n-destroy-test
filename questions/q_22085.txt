The following operation graphics were developed for a carbon adsorption system.  It is desired to remove the level of benzene from 200 mg/L to 10 mg/L.  The experiments show that a carbon depth of 3 feet (d in the below schematic) can achieve this performance.  Due to equilibrium conditions, the minimum concentration that can be achieved is 2 mg/L.   Referring to the figure below, effluent concentration (in mg/L) at state 3 is most likely:

Imagine you collected the data below to study the age and location of rocks on the sea floor.     Age and Location of Sea-floor Rocks     Rock location (km from a mid-ocean ridge)   Rock age (years)     10    300,000      25    1,000,000      40    1,625,000          Based on the chart above, if a rock is located about 50 km from the mid-ocean ridge, how old is it likely to be? (Hint: Step 1. Look at the examples given in the chart and note the relationship between the location and age. Step 2. Determine if the age increases or decreases as the distance increases and decreases. Step 3. Choose the distance that best fits the trend shown in the chart.)
Your anxious 6-year-old patient complains of a "funny feeling" in her chest, which came on suddenly while watching TV. She is slightly tachypneic, but not working hard to breathe.

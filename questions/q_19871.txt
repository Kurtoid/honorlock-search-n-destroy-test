Your friend works at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has discovered a brand-new virus that has recently been introduced into the human population. She has just developed a new assay that allows her to detect the virus by using PCR products made from the blood of infected patients. The assay uses primers in the PCR assay that hybridize to sequences in the viral genome.  Your friend is distraught because of the result she obtained (see Figure 10-28) when she looked at PCR products made using the blood of three patients suffering from the viral disease, using her own blood, and using a leaf from her petunia plant.  You advise your friend not to panic, as you believe she is missing an important control. Which one of the choices listed below is the best control for clarifying the results of her assay? Explain your answer. Figure 10-28

Use the following information to answer questions 4 and 5. Luke and Maddie have identical portfolios that consist of $195,000 invested in an ETF that is indexed to the S&P 500.   Luke adds 2 short mini S&P futures contracts to his portfolio. Maddie adds 1 long mini S&P futures contracts to her portfolio.  The notional value of EACH mini S&P500 futures contract is equal to 50 times the futures price.  Assume all margin requirements can be met with other assets they each own. Use the following 2 possible ending value scenarios to discuss the risk and return potential for each portfolio:

A car and a van approach each other at low speeds in a straight, level lane in a parking lot, going in opposite directions. The driver of the car is distracted by their phone and collides head on with the van. Since both drivers are wearing their seatbelts and both vehicles are equipped with airbags, and the speeds are low, neither driver is seriously injured.  Assume that neither driver had time to apply the brakes before or during the collision. Immediately after the collision the two vehicles are stuck to each other, and the wheels are still rolling. The car has mass m=1,400 kg and is moving at v=15.0 mph, and the van has mass M=3,600 kg and is moving at V=10.0 mph. Use a coordinate system where positive vectors point to the right.    a) What is the total momentum of the car and van system (in kg m/s units) before the collision? b) What is the velocity of the car/van immediately after the collision? c) What is the direction of the net force on the car during the collision? Explain in one sentence how you know this. d) What is the direction of the net force on the van during the collision? Explain in one sentence how you know this. e) Which is larger, the magnitude of the acceleration of the car, or the magnitude of the acceleration of the van? Explain in one sentence how you know this.

Words have two kinds of meanings--denotative and connotative. Denotative meaning is precise, literal, and objective.  It simply describes the object, person, place, idea, or event to which the word refers.   One way to think of a word's denotative meaning is its dictionary definition.  For example, denotatively, the noun school means "a place, institution, or building where instruction is given."  Connotative meaning is more variable, figurative, and subjective. Put simply, the connotative meaning is what the word suggests or implies. For instance, the connotative meaning of the word school includes the feelings, associations, and emotions that the word touches off in different people. For some people, a school might connote personal growth, childhood friends, and a special teacher. For others, it might connote frustration, discipline, and boring homework assignments.

Write a function named underline that takes a file name as a parameter and that prints the text in the file with certain lines underlined. The lines to be underlined all begin with a period and contain other data. The period should not be printed. You should print the text that follows the period on a line by itself followed by a line of dashes equal in length to the text that follows the period. If a line contains only a single period, print a blank line. For example, consider the following input:  .Statement of Purpose I didn't expect to major in computer science until I took cse142. I liked it more than I expected and that got me hooked on cs. . .High School Performance I got very good grades in high school, graduating in the top 10% of my class. . .College Performance I have done well in my college classes, with an overall gpa of 3.5. If the text above is stored in a file called input.txt and we make this call:  underline("input.txt"); the function should print the following output:  Statement of Purpose -------------------- I didn't expect to major in computer science until I took cse142. I liked it more than I expected and that got me hooked on cs. High School Performance ----------------------- I got very good grades in high school, graduating in the top 10% of my class. College Performance ------------------- I have done well in my college classes, with an overall gpa of 3.5. Notice that all lines that contain only . are replaced with blank lines and all lines that start with . and have other content as well are underlined and have the . removed.

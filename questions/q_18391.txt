ESSAY QUESTION NO. 2   (45 percent of the basic course grade.  Recommended time:  90 minutes.)            Autonomous Driving Systems, Inc. (ADS) is a new company.  It has had the good fortune to develop a laser-based system capable of guiding electric vehicles without the assistance of a human driver.              ADS has now won its first big contract to supply the system to a car manufacturer.  The manufacturer, General Motors, Inc. (GM), will use the ADS system for its next generation of electric passenger vehicles, to be assembled at its plant in Tennessee.  GM plans a run of 10,000 vehicles during the first year and, accordingly, has ordered 10,000 ADS systems.            A key component of the ADS system is a micro-chip called the F6, which ADS designed itself.  ADS won't make the F6 chip, however.  Instead, ADS has arranged for Intel, Inc., a well-established semi-conductor manufacturer, to make the chip according to ADS' specifications.            Intel will make the F6 chip at its plant in Burma, which is the only fabricating plant in the world with the sophisticated equipment necessary to make the chip.  The plant was hugely expensive and time-consuming to build; construction took five years and cost $10 billion.  Both the cost and the time is typical for such plants.  Intel manufactures a variety of micro-chips at the plant, both for itself and for its customers. Although Intel has other plants (including several in the United States), none has the equipment necessary to make the F6 chip.  Burma is a country in Southeast Asia and is sometimes known as Myanmar.              The contract between ADS and GM includes the following points:         ADS is to ship 500 systems in each of first four months, and 1000 systems in each of the remaining eight months of the contract.      GM will pay for the systems 30 days after each delivery.  The price per system is given.    ADS' obligation to make and deliver the systems to GM depends on its supply of F6 chips.  ADS will seek in good faith to have at all times a sufficient supply of the chips.     GM's obligation to pay for ADS systems is subject to GM's satisfaction with the systems upon delivery.             The contract between ADS and Intel includes the following points:       Intel is to manufacture the F6 chip according to ADS' specifications, which are attached.      Deliveries of the microchips are keyed to the quantities and times given in ADS' contract with GM.    ADS will pay for each shipment of F6 chips 30 days after it receives payment from GM for the systems that incorporate that shipment's chips.  This means that Intel will typically receive payment from ADS 60 days after each delivery by Intel, and the price that ADS is to pay under the contract reflects this period of delay.    The contract states:  "The parties' performance under this Agreement is subject to acts of God, war, government regulation, terrorism, disaster, strikes, civil disorder, curtailment of transportation facilities, or any other emergency beyond the parties' control, making it inadvisable, illegal, or which materially affects a party's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.  The occurrence of any such emergency shall excuse the parties' performance for the duration of the emergency, provided that the parties' obligations to perform will terminate altogether if the emergency lasts for more than 90 days."             For the first four months of the arrangement, things appeared to go well.  Intel made the F6 chips required by ADS and shipped them to ADS, ADS incorporated the chips into its autonomous driving systems and shipped the completed systems to GM, and GM incorporated the systems into its new range of electric vehicles.            But then, things went wrong.  Three of the first 1000 GM electric vehicles outfitted with the ADS system crashed into dummy pedestrians on the test track.  Fortunately, no one was hurt, but the failure rate of 3 in 1000 was unacceptable to GM.  GM notified ADS of the crashes and suspended payment for all ADS systems it had received to date.            ADS immediately examined the vehicles in question.  Although it couldn't be sure without more sophisticated testing equipment than it possessed, ADS believed the problem lay with the F6 chip manufactured by Intel.  Either the design of the chip was faulty or Intel had failed to manufacture a chip that met ADS' specifications exactly.  ADS notified Intel that ADS was rejecting the most recent shipment of F6 chips, revoking its acceptance of all previous shipments of F6 chips, and would not pay for any of the chips.            To make matters worse, the Burmese army staged a coup.  The Burmese army had grown increasingly concerned over the democratically elected government's moves to limit the army's power over the Burmese economy.  The army now deposed the civilian government, jailed its leaders, and took control of the country.  In response to the coup, the armed separatist movement in Burma's Karen state, which had been observing a cease-fire arranged by the now-deposed civilian government, attacked several military bases located in Karen state.  The separatists also launched an attack on Intel's plant, which they believed was owned indirectly by the Burmese military.  A series of explosions completely destroyed the facility.            Intel notified ADS that Intel's performance under the ADS-Intel contract was now impossible and, given the time required for rebuilding the plant, that Intel was cancelling the contract.  ADS, in turn, notified GM that its own performance would be temporarily impaired as it sought an alternative manufacturer of its F6 chip.  Concerned about any delay in the production of its new line of electric vehicles, GM sought a credible plan from ADS for the resumption within 30 days of ADS' performance under the GM-ADS contract, with a failure rate acceptable to GM.            You are a member of GM's legal department, which is now mulling over what to do.  No one expects ADS to line up an alternative manufacturer of the F6 chip quickly, much less to present GM with a realistic plan to resume and improve its performance under the GM-ADS contract.  The delay in rolling out GM's next generation of electric vehicles will be costly, and the autonomous driving feature may have to be dropped altogether, compounding GM's loss of competitive position in the market for advanced electric vehicles.  ADS may have breached its contract with GM, but GM can't expect ADS to pick up GM's loss.  ADS' only asset is its autonomous driving technology the value of which is now in doubt, plus any contractual claim that ADS might have against Intel.  Intel is a more attractive defendant for picking up GM's probable loss, given its substantial financial resources.            Essay Question Number 2:  GM's general counsel now turns to you and asks you for your thoughts on the following questions:        Does GM have a claim against ADS for breach of contract?  Does ADS have a defense?  Does ADS have a claim against GM for breach of contract?  Does GM have a defense?        Does ADS have a claim against Intel for breach of contract?  Does Intel have a defense?        Does GM have a contract claim against Intel for the cost of the delay in GM's manufacturing process due to the faulty F6 chip?

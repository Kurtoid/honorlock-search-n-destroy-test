Data is collected on the relationship between the average daily temperature and time spent watching television. The data is shown in the table and the line of best fit for the data isy^{"version":"1.1","math":"y^"}=-0.81x+96.7. According to the line of best fit, what would be the predicted number of minutes spent watching television for an average daily temperature of 45 degrees? Is it reasonable to use this line of best fit to make this prediction?  Select the correct answer below:

We learned that silkworm caterpillars can produce silk through their salivary glands in their mouths.  These glands enlarge as the larva grows so that a silk case is produced by the flow of the fibers from the mouth.  These fibers are one continuous strand, and can be spun into fine fabric.  Humans have cultivated silkworms for thousands of years. What is  the cultivation of silkworm moths is called?
Download: FormulaSheet_FinalExam.pdf  Question#1 - [5 points]: A Zener shunt regulator circuit below has a DC power supply VS = 12 V with the source resistance RS = 65 O. In this circuit, a Zener diode BZX55C7V5 with the Zener voltage of 7.5 V is used. This Zener diode requires a minimum current of 1 mA to operate in the breakdown region and its maximum power dissipation rating is 500 mW. What are the minimum and maximum values of the load resistance RL in order to properly operate this circuit as a voltage regulator?

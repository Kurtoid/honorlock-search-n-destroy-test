A disk has mass m = 10 kg, outer radius Ro = 1.5 m, Ri = 0.5m, and mass moment of inertia  .  The disk rolls without slipping on its inner radius at point B.  A cord is wrapped around the inner radius and passes over a pulley of radius rP = 0.2 m and is connected to a mass mF = 2 kg. In addition to the cord, there is a force P = 30 N acting tangentially and horizontally to the outer radius of the disk and a spring of stiffness k = 25 N/m that wraps around the outer radius of the disk. The spring is initially unstretched when the system is released from rest. (a) (30 points) Assuming that the pulley is massless, find the speed of the wheel, vC, after the wheel rotates through 90 degrees. (b) (5 points) If the pulley has mass mP = 0.5 kg and radius of gyration kP = 0.1 m, will your result for vC in part (a) increase or decrease? You need not obtain a numerical result or expression, but explain and justify your prediction.

Select the best answer. You are a genetic counselor, and you have been asked by a couple to help them figure out the odds of their offspring being carriers of cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive trait. The woman's father was affected by cystic fibrosis, so she knows that she is a carrier, but is not affected. The man does not know if his biological parents had cystic fibrosis, but he is unaffected. What are the chances of their offspring being carriers of cystic fibrosis, given this information?

In 1976 by checking 250 randomly selected tax-returns, it is determined 70 people indicated on their return that they would like to donate to the presidential election fund.  More recently, among 420 returns, 103 donated to the presidential election fund.  Test the claim at the 5% level that the proportion of people who make such contributions has fallen.

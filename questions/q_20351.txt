Scenario for questions 19 through 23:  You are studying the metabolism of two novel organisms, Hilltopper goati and Texococcus austinii.  You discover that they are both chemoorganoheterotrophs that grow anaerobically.  They also both have an electron transport chain containing protein complexes very similar to those found in Parococcus.  However, they use different molecules as a terminal electron acceptor.  H. goati uses Chemical H and T. austinii uses Chemical T.  The table below contains the reduction potential of all of the complexes found in Parococcus, as well as the two terminal electron acceptors Chemical H and Chemical T.    Molecule/Complex Reduction potential (V)   NADH -0.32   FADH2  -0.22   Complex I -0.30   Complex II +0.03   Q cycle +0.05   Complex III +0.10   Cytochrome C +0.22   Complex IV +0.55   Chemical H +0.15   Chemical T +0.04

The following figure shows Pipelined execution depiction for three lw instructions. Consider the figure below showing pipelined execution of three instructions. Assume Instruction 1 is lw $1, 100($0), Instruction 2 is lw $2, 200($0), and Instruction 3 is lw $3, 300($0). CC is short for "clock cycle".    Two instructions could possibly access the register file simultaneously  (__________).
Scenario: Growth RatesSuppose that real GDP per capita of the United States is $32,000 and its growth rate is 2% per year.

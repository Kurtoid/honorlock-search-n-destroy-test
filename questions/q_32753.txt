The gene Pax6 is expressed and required in the developing eye of both molluscs and vertebrates. What is the simplest explanation for this?      Pax6 is a homeotic gene.   Pax6 was independently co-opted into the developing eyes of both molluscs and vertebrates.   Mollusc eyes and vertebrateeyes both evolved from simple photoreceptors present in a common ancestor that used the Pax6 gene.   Mollusc eyes and vertebrate eyes have very similar structure that requires the Pax6 gene.

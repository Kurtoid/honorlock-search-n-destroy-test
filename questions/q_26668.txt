A system consists of two particles. At t = 0 one particle is at the origin; the other, which has a mass of 0.50 kg, is on the y-axis at y = 6.0m. At t = 0 the center of mass of the system is on the y-axis at 2.4 m. The velocity of the center of mass is given by (0.75m/s3)t2i . Find the acceleration of the center of mass at 10 s.

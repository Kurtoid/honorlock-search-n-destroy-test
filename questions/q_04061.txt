A consultant has been asked by a firm to assess the quality level of a call center process the firm might want to outsource their operations to. In the past, the average time it would take the firm to handle their own customer call was about 2.25 to 3.75 minutes. The call center processes similar customers, so the expectation is that they would be at least as good as their own operations. In short, 2.25 to 3.75 minutes would become the specifications of the firm to judge the operations of the target call center process. The target call center process has an average time of 3.1 minutes and a standard deviation of 0.2 minutes.  If the target center firm somehow is able to reduce the standard deviation of their process from the current value of 0.2 minutes to something lower, what would be the impact on its quality level?

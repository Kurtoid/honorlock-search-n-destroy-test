Consider the permutations method from the textbook, which is intended to return all permutations of the word passed in as a parameter. How does the permutations method simplify its input for the recursive call? public static ArrayList permutations(String word) {  ArrayList result = new ArrayList();  if (word.length() == 0) // line #1  {  result.add(word); // line #2  return result; // line #3  }  else  {  for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) // line #4  {  String shorter = word.substring(0, i) + word(substring(i + 1); // line #5  ArrayList shorterPermutations = permutations(shorter); // line #6  for (String s : shorterPermutations) // line #7  {  result.add(word.charAt(i) + s); // line #8  }  }  return result; // line #9  } }

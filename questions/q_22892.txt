The primary care pediatric nurse practitioner is evaluating a 2-year-old with a documented speech delay. Screenings to assess motor skills and cognition are normal, and the child passed a recent hearing test. What will the pediatric nurse practitioner do next?

Language development requires oral-motor ability, auditory perception, and cognitive ability, which this child has been shown to have, as well as the psychosocial-cultural environment to motivate the child to engage in language use. The PCPNP's initial step should be to determine whether the parents provide such an environment. Educational materials may be used after it is determined that these are useful. Early intervention may be used if the speech delay persists. Music videos do not necessarily engage the child in expression of speech.

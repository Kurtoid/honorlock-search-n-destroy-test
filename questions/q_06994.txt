Choose the statistical test best suited to the following data set (assume that the data are normally distributed). A massive cloud-seeding experiment was conducted in the sky over Oklahoma. For two months, whenever a cumulus cloud was detected, an airplane flew over and either "seeded" it with micoscopic particles of silver iodide, a potent ice nucleator or dropped the same mass of coarse sand (which is not a suitable nucleator). The treatment was assigned at random (i.e., seeded or control) and the sample size was 20 of each. Ground-based observers reported whether it rained within 3 hours of the airplane's passing.
Consider the partial rate factors for electrophilic aromatic substitution at the indicated position of anisole and nitrobenzene. Which of the following correlates to these partial rate factors (you may compare each of them to benzene)?
Which of the following is NOT a determinant of behavior?
The following molecule is aromatic.     a) Draw an orbital picture (using p orbitals) that shows how the molecule is aromatic.  b) How many pi electrons are in the aromatic (or delocalized) system of the molecule? You may briefly explain your answer for partial credit. c) draw a resonance structure of the original molecule showing how one lone pair can be delocalized. You may include curved arrow notation for partial credit. Check the charges on your drawing.

In deliberating a national rollout in 2015, PDB has set an objective of breaking even on its 2014 "soft launch" advertising budget.  At its proposed retail price of $2.75 per can, Crescent Pure would have to sell about 140,000 cases to break even.  If PDB maintained CP's current retail price of $3.75 per can, the breakeven number of cases would be about 47,000 cases.  When combined with other information in the case, what are the implications of the two breakeven computations for Crescent Pure's positioning?   Consider factors such as production capacity, sales history, customer price perceptions, the impact of the potential positioning, etc. (100-word limit).

Calculate the molar solubility of silver chloride (AgCl) in 1.0 M NH3.    (Assume x is small compared to 1.0 M NH3; the simplifying assumption is valid.)   Consider the following reactions and information: Dissolution reaction: AgCl (s) = Ag+ (aq) + Cl- (aq); Ksp = 1.8 x 10-10 Complexation reaction: Ag+ (aq) + 2 NH3 (aq) = Ag(NH3)2+ (aq); Kf = 1.7 x 107   Combined reaction: AgCl (s) + 2 NH3 (aq) = Cl- (aq) + Ag(NH3)2+ (aq); Kc = 3.1 x 10-3   Answering this question incorrectly will not count against your exam score.  The correct answer will add 5 points to your exam score.  This will be added when I review all exams.

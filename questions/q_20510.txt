Only work in Canvas will be graded for this question. At numerous times in the last few weeks, Dr. Pantazes has stated that Figure 5-4 (page 195) is the TS diagram for both a reversible heat engine and a reversible refrigeration cycle. Problems 2 and 3 use the same fluid (H2O) and operate between the same pressures (0.8 and 20 bar), yet the work of the reversible turbine and the reversible compressor for the systems are not equal and opposite. Explain why this is the case. If you were unsuccessful in solving Problem 2 and/or 3, you may use values of -400 for the reversible turbine and +700 kJ / kg for the reversible compressor in your explanation. Standard Advice for Explain Questions: A definition alone is not a good explanation, although it may be part of one. A good explanation expands beyond a definition to clearly and concisely articulate the key concepts of the explanation and why they are important in CHEN.

Use the following prompt to answer questions 2A - 2E: 2) Precision Parts. Berkeley Manufacturing Company (BMC) employs a four-step production process to produce metal-alloy-coated precision parts. The first step is fabrication. The fabrication machine takes 7.5 minutes per unit to mold raw material into the proper shape of a part. The second step is coating. The coating machine applies a layer of one of many metal alloys at high heat. The coating machine takes 24 minutes, and it can coat up to six units (of the same metal alloy) at a time. The third step is cooling. It takes 50 minutes for a coated part to cool. No equipment is required for this step, and there is plenty of cooling space. The fourth step is polishing, which takes 5 minutes per part. For simplicity, you should assume the production system operates continuously (i.e., 24 hours a day) and that the system has been running for some time.

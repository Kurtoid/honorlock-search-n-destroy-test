Consider the MIPS pseudo instruction,                                              isave $r ,where $r can be any saved or temporary register. The pseudo instruction initializes ALL saved registers to the data in $r. How will an assembler expand this into a set of "real" instructions? (hints: please program a segment of MIPS code to implement "pseudo instruction isave $r", initializes ALL saved registers to the data in $r).

PROBLEM D - Choose only ONE from #D1 or #D2 (not both! Or you will receive the lowest score).   D1. In the nation of Tinyland, has 20 competitive apple producers. They sell apple at the world price of $2 per apple. The production function is described by Q= 100L - L2 where Q is the number of apples produced in a day and L is the number of workers. The marginal product of labor (MPL) which is the first derivative of the production is given by MPL = 100 - 2L.  a) If the daily wage is fixed at w, what is each producer's labor demand as a function of w? What is the total market demand in TinyLand? b) Tinyland has 200 workers who supply their labor inelastically. Solve for the wage w. c) How many workers does each producer hire? How much profit does each producer make?    D2.  Synergy and Dynaco are the only two firms in a specific high-tech industry.

In dogs, one pair of alleles determines coat color (dark and albino). Another pair of alleles determines hair length (short and long). Thus, each gamete will contain one of the coat-color alleles, C or c, and one of the hair-length alleles, B or b. In repeated crosses of a specific dark, short-haired dog with an albino, long-haired dog, all the offspring were dark with short hair, as shown in cross I. However, in subsequent crosses of another dark, short-haired dog with a dark, long-haired dog, the ratios shown in cross II below were obtained. Which of the following correctly describes the relationship of the dark-coat-color allele to the albino condition?

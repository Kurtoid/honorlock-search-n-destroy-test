The trade show is open Monday through Sunday, from 9 am until 9 pm daily.  Approximately 6,000 trade show attendees will visit your booth during the show.  While 9,000 people will attend the show during the week, only 4,000 are within your target market.  Past data reveals that 60% of the attendees visit a majority of the booths at this show.  Of those that visit your booth, 2,000 are in your target market.  Your booth staff will average 6 minutes speaking with each contact.  You will need an additional 57 square feet for private places, storage, etc.  Exhibiting at the show will generate qualified sales leads that will be directly responsible for 100 new sales for the firm.  You may assume that your staff speaks with all that are included in your attraction efficiency.  The averages across all industries and product types apply in this situation.  Round up to the nearest square foot.   Your formula for trade show booth size is: (Attendance * Product Interest % * A.I.F. * 50) / (Show Hours * Salesperson Rate)   What is your conversion efficiency? (enter your answer as a percentage, i.e., 12.4, or 73.8, etc.)

The production of acetanilide(C8H9NO) involves the treatment of aniline(C6H7N) with acetic anhydride(C4H6O3).  This reaction produces an amide called acetanilide(C8H9NO) and the byproduct acetic acid (C2H4O2).  The reaction is as follows: aniline           +           acetic anhydride         --------->      acetanilide             +          acetic acid C6H7N                           C4H6O3                                         C8H9NO                              C2H4O2 molar mass C6H7N = 93.13 g/mol             molar mass C4H6O3 = 102.09 g/mol molar mass C8H9NO = 135.16 g/mol        molar mass C2H4O2 = 60.05 g/mol Since aniline is a liquid, conversion from milliliters to grams will yield the equivalence of 4.000 grams of aniline(C6H7N).  The mass of aniline(C6H7N) used in the reaction equals to 4.000 grams. The reaction goes 100% to completion and aniline(C6H7N) is the limiting reagent. If after performing this synthesis the actual mass of acetanilide(C8H9NO) is 4.420 grams, calculate the percent yield.  Select the best choice. (*hint: reaction balanced?)

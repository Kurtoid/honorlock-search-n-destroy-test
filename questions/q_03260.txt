The patient is a 66-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital after being seen in her physician's office with the complaint of difficulty in swallowing, first solid food and now difficulty with swallowing liquids.  She was found to be dehydrated and was admitted.  A gastroenterology consult was obtained, and the physician recommended an esophagogastrodenoscopy to rule out esophageal stricture or obstruction.  The patient became very anxious, even with the administration of conscious sedation, during the start of the EGD, and it was postponed.  After discussion with the patient and the primary care physician, the gastroenterologist recommended the procedure be performed under general anesthesia, which was accomplished.  The EGD was performed, and no obstruction, stricture, lesions, ulcers, polyps, or other disease was found in the esophagus, in the stomach, or small bowel, which was also examined.  After being reassured that there was no disease or cancer present in her upper GI tract, the patient appeared very relieved.  That evening she was able to eat a soft diet meal and drink liquids.  The primary care physician listed the final diagnoses as dysphagia, cause unknow; anxiety disorder; and dehydration.

Case Study #1 NT is a 17 year old Caucasian female who was admitted recently to the hospital with a high plasma glucose concentration, ketonuria and the classic symptoms of type 1 diabetes mellitus. A confirmed diagnosis of type 1 DM was subsequently made. NT is now an outpatient in your clinic, and she is in the process of learning about the nutritional management of this disease, as well as how to administer insulin and monitor her glucose concentration. NT's insulin regimen consists of insulin injections twice a day using a combination of short acting (regular) and intermediate (NPH) insulin before breakfast and before dinner. Seven months have elapsed since NT was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. NT has been monitoring her blood glucose concentration and finds that her fasting morning blood sugar is consistently high. An evaluation of her usual eating habits and insulin regimen (as described in the case scenario) reveals that she is very compliant with what has been prescribed. You ask her to check her blood glucose in the middle of the night for several nights and the results show that she consistently has a low blood glucose concentration (hypoglycemia) at about 3 AM. From this information, you assess that NT's elevated fasting morning blood glucose can probably be explained by:

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is an example of
Bonds  a. Discuss the relationship between interest rates and bond prices. b.  If you were certain that interest rates were about to fall significantly, what type of bond (maturity & coupon rate characteristics) would you buy now (before rates fall)? Why?  c. In addition to interest rates (and inflation, which directly affects rates), what is another primary cause of a bond price change?

If you were asked to evaluate the definite integral  , which substitution would you use?  As your u=? [u] As your corresponding du=? [du] What is the lower limit of integration after the substitution? [ua] What is the upper limit of integration after the substitution? [ub]   Hint: To enter the substitution , you should type "3 (x+1)^2 + atan(pi x)" (without the quotes).
Problem 8) Bonus   Write a testbench module named TEST in Verilog or System Verilog that adds AA = 4'b0111 and BB = 4'b0010 and Cin = 1'b0 using the ripple adder module you wrote above and displays all results to the screen.  Also, What is the resulting value of Sum, Cout, and OF in this case? Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables. Do not use compiler directives except perhaps `timescale.

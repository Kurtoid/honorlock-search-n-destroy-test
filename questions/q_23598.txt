VT Corporation has two outstanding classes of stock:   5,000 shares of 8%, $100 par-value cumulative preferred stock 25,000 shares of $10 par-value common stock  The company had a $50,000 deficit (negative retained earnings) at the beginning of 2020, and preferred dividends were last paid in 2017. During 2020, the company earned $300,000. What will be the balance in Retained Earnings at the end of 2020 (after all closing entries), if the company does everything necessary to declare and pay a dividend of $2 per share on the common stock during the year?

Q8. Water enters a 3-cm-diameter and 30-m-long tube who walls are maintained at 100 oC with a bulk temperature of 25 oC and volume flow rate of 3 m3/h. Assuming Nusselt number can be determined from Nu = 0.023Re0.8Pr0.4, determine the  convective heat transfer coefficient.  Is the flow fully developed when it leaves (exit out of) the pipe? Is the flow laminar or turbulent? Properties of water can be found from the data sheet attached.
33. Which of the following has the largest mitochondria?
How are mature melanin granules produced?  Be sure to include any relevant enzymes.
The McGirk effect occurs when?
A suspension of yeast cells is being grown under anaerobic conditions such that glucose is degraded to ethanol and carbon dioxide.Adding an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase to the yeast cell suspension results in rapid cell death. Why?   a) Pyruvate is no longer being produced for use in gluconeogenesis, so the cells quickly deplete this energy source.   b) Loss of this enzyme during anaerobic glucose degradation leads to an increased requirement for ATP, which cannot be met.   c) NADH generated during glycolysis cannot be recycled back to NAD+, thus anaerobic ATP production through glycolysis cannot be maintained.   d) Without alcohol dehydrogenase, the acetaldehyde concentration increases to levels that are toxic to the yeast cells.
A medical sample contains some , which decays by beta minus particle emission with a half-life of [h] days. b) (5 pts) If the amount of  in the sample is only  of the amount that was present in the sample when it was prepared, how much time has elapsed? {Enter the value (not the units) in the box below.

Which of the following is a reason for companies adopting variable costing for internal reporting purposes?
What is the pH of a [x] M isoquinoline (C9H7N) solution?           C9H7N (aq) + H2O (l) =   C9H7NH+ (aq) + OH- (aq)  Kb = 2.5 x 10-9

If it falls within the plants battery limits, storm (rain) water must be treated to ensure it's quality before returning it to the water source.
Preemption occurs when Congress chooses to act exclusively on a subject over which the federal government shares power with the states.
A) What are the pouches (example in green, labeled A) called? B) Name the 4 divisions of the colon, in order
Scuba divers sometimes use a type of air called EAN (enhanced air nitrox).  These tanks have higher amounts of oxygen and, thus, lower amounts of nitrogen.  Using this type of air on a scuba dive can increase the amount of time you can stay "on the bottom," enjoying the wildlife and such.  It also makes a faster ascent (returning to your boat) less dangerous.   If humans breathed 36% oxygen in atmospheric air, how would this affect the oxygen carrying capacity of our blood?
Process A had no beginning work in process, but completed and transferred out 85,000 units during a period and had 50,000 units in the ending work in process inventory that were 30% complete. The equivalent units of production for the period were:

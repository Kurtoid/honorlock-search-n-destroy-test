The following figure shows a wire in the shape of a quarter of a circle with radius R{"version":"1.1","math":"R"}. The center of the circle is located at position (0,0){"version":"1.1","math":"(0,0)"}. If there is a current I0{"version":"1.1","math":"I0"} in the wire, moving in the clockwise direction, what is the magnetic field vector at the point (-R,R){"version":"1.1","math":"(-R,R)"}? You should leave your answer in the form of a well-defined integral using only universal constants, numbers, variables given in the problem and the coordinate that you will be integrating over. For clarity, the circular arc does run from the +x^{"version":"1.1","math":"+x^"}-axis to the+y^{"version":"1.1","math":"+y^"} axis.

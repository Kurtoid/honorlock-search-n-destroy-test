[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).]   A vehicle is being driven on a distant planet, where the acceleration due to gravity is 7.22 m/s2.  The mass of the vehicle is 2000.0 kg.  The vehicle is driving over a hill with radius of curvature of 180.0 m.         a. Determine the force of gravity (weight) acting on the vehicle.        b. Determine the normal force acting on the vehicle by the planet's surface when the vehicle drives over the crest (top-most point) of the hill described above at 30.0 m/s.        c. Given that the mass of the planet is 4.39 x 1023 kg, use Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation to determine the radius of the planet.   Enter your answers for a, b, and c into the space below, including signs and units, as appropriate.  Show all work on a blank piece of paper or blank problem-solving template that you will scan and turn in at the end of the exam.

A nurse is caring for a client who is postoperative following knee arthroplasty and has a new prescription for enoxaparin 1mg/kg/dose subcutaneous every 12 hr. The client weighs 185 lb. How many mg should the nurse administer per dose? (Round the answer to the nearest tenth).
What term refers to bone's varied (different) responses to different loading directions?
Receptor X (XR) is a transmembrane protein. This protein has been engineered as a fusion protein containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) at its C-terminus.  XR-GFP is a functional protein and can replace XR in the cells.  Cells expressing XR-GFP or artificial lipid vesicles (liposomes) containing XR-GFP are subjected to fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP).  The intensity of the fluorescence of a small spot on the surface of the cells (solid line) or on the surface of the liposomes (dashed lines) is measured prior to and following photobleaching (arrow).  Explain the different behavior of XR-GFP in lipsomes vs. in the plasma membrane of the cell.

A schematic shown in Figure 5 of a piping system that is used to move water at 20 degC from a lower pond to an upper pond using a pump at a flowrate of Q = 0.1 m3/s. The elevation between the two ponds is 40 m. The diameter of the plastic piping with an inner diameter of D=10 cm with a roughness factor of e = 0 and a net length of l= 300 m. The loss coefficients for the entrance, exit, 90deg elbows, and valve are provided in Figure 5.   Figure 5.   Assuming steadying, incompressible flow, determine the following:  Minor losses in m; major losses using the Moody chart in m; and the required shaft work to overcome losses and elevation changes in kW .

Write a function named fixIndentation that accepts a string parameter representing a file name and an integer n representing the amount of spaces to be used for indentation. Your function should open/read that file's contents and print it to the console with correct indentation. For this problem assume that the file contains code in C, C++, Java or any other similar language that uses {} curly braces for scope and // for single line comments. You can assume there will be no multi-line comments and that you will have one statement per line (no lines with }} at the end). However, the curly brace or semicolon may not be the last character on the line as lines can have comments at the end. Output the entire contents of the file to the console with correct indentation. This means with n more spaces at the beginning each time after a new curly brace is opened and n less spaces at the beginning of each line (and the following lines) where a curly brace is closed. Do not change the placement of the line breaks in the input file. For example, if an input file example.cpp contained the following data: // Draws a triangle of dots          // example CODE#include    int main() { for(int line = 1; line

Background Imagine you manage a team of salespeople. You have a CSV file where each row represents a sales lead that may or may not have resulted in a closed sale. The CSV has the following columns:  Salesperson (the name of a salesperson, a string) Client (the name of the potential client, a string) Year (the year of the contact, an int) Lead (always has a value of 1) Closed_sale (has a value of 1 if the contact resulted in a salesperson closing a deal with the client, otherwise 0)  A given salesperson's closing rate is their total number of closed sales divided by their total leads. Instructions Write a function that takes one argument, a string containing a path to a CSV file like the one described above. Your function should return a Pandas Series object containing the closing rate of each salesperson in the dataset. Your analysis should include only leads/sales from the year 2020. You can assume Pandas was imported as pd. For full credit, your solution should not use any loops. You may not use any module other than Pandas.

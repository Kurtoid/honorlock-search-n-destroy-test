In a file server, the following steps have to be performed on each request: (1) parse request, (2) find and read file, (3) respond with file or error message. Assume steps (1) and (3) take 1ms and step (2) takes 2ms. Assume any delays due to inter-thread communication, synchronization, context-switching, etc. are negligible. Assume you have infinite resources. Consider a boss-worker and a pipelined model designs, each with a total of 4 threads. In both cases, you need to process a total of 6 requests. Answer the questions below. Please try to follow these rules:- Do not write the units. - Do not use a comma in your answer (e.g., write 1000 instead of 1,000 or write 0.75 instead of 0,75). - Write the leading zero in decimal fractions (e.g., write 0.75 instead of .75)- Show the results with up to two decimal places. Questions:For the boss-worker model, where the boss simply accepts requests and passes them onto a shared workers' queue: a) How many requests can be processed concurrently? [a] b) How long does it take to process a total of 6 requests in ms? [b]ms c) What is the average throughput for this workload, in req/ms? [c]req/ms d) What is the average response time for this workload, in ms? [d]ms For a balanced implementation of the pipeline model: e) How many threads are allocated to the first stage? [e] f) How many threads are allocated to the second stage? [f] g) How many requests are concurrently being processed? [g] h) How long does it take to process a total of 6 requests in ms? [h]ms i) What is the average throughput for this workload, req/ms? [i]req/ms j) What is the average response time for this workload, in ms? [j]ms

4.    One of your friends on campus who is working on her dissertation in the College of Criminology is considering PLS to run some data. After reading few articles about PLS, she is knocking on your door with a few questions for you.  Please respond to the following two questions below in a way that would impress your peer student and solidify the belief that you are in fact well trained.  Include relevant papers for the doctoral student to read wherever appropriate. a.    She is excited to hear that PLS is the 'new big thing' when it comes to running structural models.  Why is that?  In other words, what are its advantages and disadvantages over the "regular" SEM? (10 points) b.    She is aware of how covariances-based SEM tells her whether her model fits the data.  Is there any way to tell whether a PLS model works? Please be thorough as possible in helping your friend with it. (5 points)

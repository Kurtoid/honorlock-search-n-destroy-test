You are consulting a major metropolitan city. Each workday 300,000 people enter the city by bus or metro. If by metro, it takes an average fixed amount of time for the commute which is 30 minutes. If traveling by buses, it takes 20 minutes plus another 1 minute for every 10,000 commuters taking the buses (i.e., the buses slow down as the number of commuters goes up). Let y = the number of people taking buses. The city wants to minimize the average travel time for all commuters. Write a linear optimization function to find the value of y that achieves the city's objective.

A toy rocket is launched vertically from ground level (y = 0 m), at time t = 0.0 s. The rocket engine provides constant upward acceleration during the burn phase. At the instant of engine burnout, the rocket has risen to 70 m and acquired a velocity of 30 m/s. The rocket continues to rise in unpowered flight, reaches maximum height, and falls back to the ground. The upward acceleration of the rocket during the burn phase is closest to:

The southeastern United States is experiencing the greatest losses. The Emergency Wetlands Resources Act (EWRA) of 1986 requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to conduct status and trend studies of the nation's wetlands and to report the results to Congress each decade, with the overall goal being no more net loss of wetlands.

There are 5,000 households in Village V. Of all households in Village, 30% of the households uses more than one language. The mean household size of all 5,000 households is 4.2 and the standard deviation of household size is 1.1. Suppose that you randomly select 30 households from Village V and find that 28% of the selected households use more than one language. The mean household size of this sample is 4.4 and the standard deviation is 1.3. Identify the values which correspond to the symbols n and

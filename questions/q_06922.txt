Read the selection from the article, "Leaders Must Avoid Excessive Temper and Pride" by Richard Brody. Answer the questions that follow. There is an ancient proverb that says, "Temper gets you into trouble, pride keeps you there." While this is certainly true for all of us, it is especially important for those that strive to become great leaders. In my over thirty years of training and developing leaders, I have become convinced that someone who has difficulty controlling his temper can never effectively lead. In addition, an individual who permits his personal pride (a.k.a. ego) to get in the way of effective leadership is ill-suited to be a leader. 1. Every individual who has ever led any organization invariably, at one time or another, upsets someone, either by something he did, did not do, said, or did not say. Sometimes, someone feels that a leader did not thank him sufficiently, and becomes offended. The greatest leaders emphasize their communication and people skills, and reach out to these individuals to discover the issue, and to discuss it one to one, without any pre-bias or prejudice. One of the essentials of great leadership is the ability to sublimate one's ego for the good of the organization. Unfortunately, far too many individuals that lead organizations instead simply get angry and "develop an attitude" towards the already offended party. A great leader realizes that there is often a miscommunication or misinterpretation that causes the riff, while the weaker leader gets mad, and often tries to get even. This anger is often the potential downfall of the leader, who then often loses his temper, and even worse, demonstrates this temper in public. Others observe this fete of anger, and develop a lower opinion of the leader, creating a further obstacle to effective leadership. 2. Even worse is when the individual in the leadership position becomes offended that someone had the "audacity" to criticize him, and did not "appreciate" all his hard work and efforts. Many of these poorly fitted leaders then develop a "Can't please them anyway so why try" attitude, which then causes a dearth of leadership. These people's pride and ego often causes reactive instead of proactive behavior, which then further offends others. In addition, and with generally more dire ramifications to the organization, the leader's ego "turns off" members, and creates and casts a negative image both on the organization and the leader himself. Overly prideful leaders often find it very difficult "to let go" and continue to harbor a grudge. They often become petty and spiteful, and place their pride ahead of any of the organization's or its members needs. Every organization should carefully and fully develop and explore these issues of temper and pride as part of their professionally designed and implemented leadership training program.

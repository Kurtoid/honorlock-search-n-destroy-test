Consider the implications of adding a three-input addition, ADD3, to the MIPS ISA. This new instruction operates on registers only and performs the computation A = B+C+D.   (a) What are the two most significant changes to add such an instruction to a single-cycle MIPS datapath? (b) Beyond the two changes you listed for the single-cycle design, what are the two most significant additional changes to add such an instruction to our standard five-stage pipelined datapath (the number of stages is unchanged and ADD3 executes entirely in the "EX" stage)? (c) An alternative implementation would be to split the execution of ADD3 over two cycles ("EX" and "M", completing at the end of the "M" stage). Explain the potential performance advantage and disadvantage of such an implementation versus the implementation of ADD3 executing entirely in the "EX" stage. (d) Yet another way of implementing ADD3 would be by using micro-ops (as done in x86). What would be the key advantage and disadvantage of implementing ADD3 in this way?

The circular folds of the small intestine enhance absorption by causing the chyme to spiral, rather than to move in a straight line, as it passes through the small intestine. Is this statement true or false?
After pregnancy, milk is produced in the breast by a group of cells known as lactocytes. Lactocytes are cube-like epithelial cells that line the interior of the alveoli, which are sacs where the milk collects after it is secreted (see figure). When an infant suckles, the levels of the hormone prolactin, which stimulates milk production, increase in the blood. Additionally, sensory nerve fibers in the areola trigger a neuroendocrine reflex that results in milk secretion from lactocytes into the lumen of the alveoli. This process of lactation is an example of ______.
Order:  Gentamycin 1 gram IVPB every 12 hours. The pharmacy sends the medication dissolved in NS 150 mL.  The tubing has a drip factor of 12gtts/mL. The medication is to infuse over 30 minutes.

You have performed multiple linear regression to determine predicted values of a plasma bioassay for high ethanol intake (using a CDT, carbohydrate-deficient transferrin assay) in a large group (1000) of cooperative males of various ages.  These men have been trained to confidentially and accurately report their "actual ethanol intake" per day over a period of 6 weeks. You measure their body fat, race, their estimate of weekly ethanol intake, age and serum CDT levels. You determine that all of these variables are statistically important except "race." What would be the ideal form you would use to express the predicted values for this variable?    1"Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin, known as "%CDT," is a blood test to detect heavy alcohol use (five or more drinks a day) over the past two weeks. This alcohol biomarker can provide clinicians with an objective way to screen and monitor clients in treatment for alcohol use disorders." (Wikipedia)

"Psychologists of mass behavior might have an explanation for what went wrong in China in the late summer of 1958. China was struck with a mass hysteria fed by Mao, who then fell victim himself. Mao began believing the party slogans, casting caution to the winds. As we set out by train heading south from Beijing, the scene along the railroad tracks was incredible. Harvest time was approaching, and the crops were thriving. The fields were crowded with peasants at work. The backyard steel furnaces that had been established in the peasant communes had transformed the rural landscape. They were everywhere, and we could see peasant men in a constant frenzy of activity, transporting fuel and raw materials, keeping the fires stoked. Every commune we visited provided testimony to the abundance of the upcoming harvest. The statistics for both grain and steel production were astounding. Mao's earlier skepticism had vanished, and common sense had escaped him. The excitement was contagious, and I was infected too. As we continued on our journey, however, Mao's personal secretary Lin Ke set me straight. What we were seeing from our windows on the train was all staged, he said. The party secretaries had ordered the furnaces constructed along our rail route. Rice plants had been moved from faraway fields along our route so that Mao would see a wildly abundant crop. All of China was a stage, all the people performers in an extravaganza for Mao. The agricultural production figures were false, Lin Ke said, and what was coming out of the backyard furnaces was useless." Li Zhisui, personal physician to Mao Zedong, biography of Mao, published in the United States, 1994            Li Zhisui's description of the actions of the local party secretaries in the third paragraph is significant because it can be most directly used to explain the ways in which individuals within communist China reacted to the government's

Instructions: For the following questions, select the letter of the answer that correctly identifies each type of prewriting.   Aug. 21. Classes started today, and I'm taking four difficult ones. I'm not worried about my English class because I like the instructor. Math is always hard for me, though, so my algebra class is sure to be a lot of work. I'll have to put in a lot of study time. My weight training P.E. class will be great, help me get into better shape. I've also got an Introduction to Computers class. I'm looking forward to that one because I enjoy learning more about computers.   Aug. 23. Today, I heard on the news that many young people are getting in over their heads when it comes to credit-card debt. Some of them charge thousands of dollars and then can't pay it off. Credit-card companies aren't going to stop giving cards to teenagers and college students, so maybe high schools and colleges should offer financial management courses to help young people learn how to stick to a budget and avoid getting into debt.   This prewriting is an example of

Problem 4 (15 points) LaserLife Printer Cartridge Company is a decentralized organization with several divisions. Operating results for the Packer Division for 2012 are budgeted as follows:       Sales   $5,000,000     Less variable costs   2,500,000     Contribution margin   2,500,000     Less fixed costs   1,800,000          Operating income   $   700,000       Operating assets for the division are currently $3,600,000. For 2012, the division could add a new product line, not now included in the budget, by investing an additional $300,000 in operating assets. The new product line does not change the firm's risk. It will generate additional sales of $1,600,000 per year, and variable costs of the new product will average 60% of the selling price. Additional fixed costs of $600,000 per year for salaries and benefits of specialized staff will be incurred each year that the product is produced. Packer's required rate of return is 12%. Unless otherwise indicated, Packer prefers to use pre-tax operating income for all its income-based performance measures.   Required:  1. What will Packer Division's return on investment be in 2012 (a) without the new product line and (b) with the new product line? (Express as a %, with one decimal place, e.g., 13.5%.) 2. What will Packer Division's residual income be in 2012 (a) without the new product line and (b) with the new product line? 3. Should Packer add the new product line? Explain briefly. 4. Assume the firm's tax rate is 35% and current liabilities are $100,000. What will be the firm's EVA if they added the new product line? Consider WACC to be 12%.

Lisez cet article et repondez aux questions.   Zoom sur la formation de l'ecole 42   Fin mars dernier, lors d'une conference de presse, Xavier Niel, accompagne de Nicolas Sadirac, fondateurs, entre autres, de l'ecole Epitech, annoncait la naissance de 42, ecole privee gratuite financee sur ses fonds propres. Le but : trouver et former les futurs << genies >> de l'informatique qui, selon Niel, sont ignores par le systeme educatif francais actuel.   Pour entrer a 42, il fallait d'abord passer un test de preselection en ligne de huit heures au terme duquel 4 000 candidats ont ete retenus. Ces derniers doivent ensuite passer l'epreuve de la << piscine >> : un mois en immersion dans le code informatique quasiment 24 heures sur 24. Les sessions, par tranche de mille candidats, ont debute cet ete. Mille etudiants en tout seront admis en premiere annee de ce cycle de trois ans (mais, selon les mots de Nicolas Sadirac, ils auront deja le niveau d'un diplome d'ecole d'ingenieur au bout d'un an) .    Laurene Castor, blogueuse passionnee par les nouveaux systemes educatifs, decide, d'abord par simple curiosite, de passer les premiers tests. Neophyte en code, elle est neanmoins admissible. Elle se lance alors dans l'aventure de la "piscine",  et decide de la raconter, jour apres jour, sur son blog.   C'est un recit fascinant (et pas encore termine). Le systeme pedagogique mis en place  (qui ressemble a celui qui existe deja pour l'Epitech) met sans arret a l'epreuve la motivation des candidats, que ce soit pour les epreuves, les conditions d'hebergement ou les systemes de correction.  Finalement, pour etre un genie a la sauce (a genius according to)  Xavier Niel, il ne faut peut-etre pas le bac, mais il faut etre extremement motive et capable de dormir sous des neons allumes non-stop.   QUESTIONS:  1. Quel est le sujet de cet article et du blog de Laurene Castor ? [1]  2. L'ecole 42 est financee par Xavier Niel et Nicolas Sadirac. Vrai ou Faux ? [2] 3. C'est la premiere fois que Xavier Niel et Nicolas Sadirac fondent une ecole. Vrai ou Faux ? [3] 4. Quel est l'objectif de l'ecole 42 ? [4]  5. La premiere epreuve est... [5]  6. La deuxieme epreuve est... [6] 7. Pour reussir a l'ecole 42, il faut beaucoup de motivation. [7]  8. Les etudiants de l'ecole 42 travaillent enormement. [8]

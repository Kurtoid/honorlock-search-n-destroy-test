An experiment was done with potatoes.  Some were were at room temperature, some were placed in a warm water bath, and some were placed in a boiling water bath. A substrate was added to each tube that interacted with an enzyme in the potatoes.  The reaction was rated from 0-5, with 5 being the highest. Room temperature had a reaction rated at 3. Warm water bath had a reaction rated at 4. Boiling water bath had a reaction rated at 0. Please explain:  why the amount of reaction increased in warm water why the reaction stopped in boiling water

1) Two muscles on the back in the leg pull on the Achilles tendon as shown below. F1 and F2 both have 200 N magnitude, and make 20 degree angle with the vertical line. What is the net force exerted by the muscles? (5 points)  2) When opening a door, you push on it perpendicularly with a force of 55.0 N at a distance of 0.85 m from the hinges. What torque are you exerting relative to the hinges? (5 points)   3) Suppose you exert a force of 150 N tangential to a 0.250 m radius, 75 kg grindstone ( a solid disk).         A) Calculate the torque exerted by this force. (5 points)         B) Calculate the rotational inertia of the grindstone. (5 points)   4) A car moving at 12 m/s crashes into a concrete wall and stops in 0.25 s. Calculate the force the seatbelt exerts on a passenger in the car to bring him to a halt. The mass of the passenger is 65 kg.  (5 points)

For individuals suspected to have hypersensitivity to an allergen, skin and blood tests can be performed. For the skin test, an allergen is administered and the reaction is monitored visually. For the blood test, allergen-specific mediators are typically assayed. For a patient suspected to have Type 1 hypersensitivity, which would be the most appropriate mediator to assay for?

For the global circulation diagram below, indicate the cell, pressure belt, or wind system associated with each number (a couple numbers may have a couple different possible choices). Type out the entire name. NOTE: You will see this map for four (4) questions in a row. For each question, you only need to identify ONE (1) circulation cell, pressure belt or wind system - you do NOT need to identify them for all ten numbers. The number for which this question is asking is in RED just above the map and just below these instructions. Each is worth 0.5 points. It is designed this way so that Canvas can select four random numbers for each student, and you can still see the map for each question. You do NOT have to read these instructions again for each question; they are the same for each, so please do not waste your exam time re-reading them unless you need to.   For this question, identify a circulation cell, pressure belt, or wind system at location 6.

According to the cushion curve below, there exist 2 different static loadings for the TARGET/critical acceleration of 30 G's.   Which one should you select for a packaging design against such a shock? Justify your answer. Based on the physics of a package-cushion system and the method used to establish cushion curves, explain why this given target/critical acceleration and cushion thickness intersect the cushion curves at two different static loadings.

Allen entered into a valid contract with Target to buy a Black & Decker Cordless String Trimmer (Weed Eater) on March 1, 2021. Black & Decker boasted about the machine's precision trimming ability. At 8:30 p.m. on March 8, 2021, Allen's 10-year-old son told his dad that he was having his school picture taken the next morning. Allen's son needed a haircut before the photo shoot, and the barber shop was closed for the day. Allen decided to trim his son's hair with the Black & Decker String Trimmer because it was advertised to give a precision cut.  Allen kept the guard on the trimmer, like the Black & Decker product information instructed. However, the precision string trimmer shook violently and practically jumped out of Allen's hands. When the trimmer jerked away from Allen, it cut off the top of his son's right ear. Allen's son had to have his right ear sewn back on and was hospitalized overnight. He has continued to seek medical treatment for pain and scars. His medical expenses now total $6,000. The product literature did not include any warnings except to use the trimmer with the guard in place. Also, there are 1,000 other complaints nationwide about the trimmer shaking and jumping out of the users' hands. Allen obviously thinks something is horribly wrong with his weed eater and hired an attorney to sue for damages. Based on the above information, please answer the following question in detail: Under what Louisiana law can Allen file suit against Black & Decker?

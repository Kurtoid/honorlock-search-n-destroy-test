Use the picture, variables, and problem setup from here to answer this and the following three questions. The answer to part a is the answer to this question. The following parts are answered in questions 25, 26, and 27. An LC circuit with a period of oscillation of  = [period] ms has a capacitor of size  = [C] uF. At time  = 0, the energy in the inductor is  = [UL] mJ and the energy in the capacitor is  = [UC] mJ.  (7 pts) What is the maximum charge that capacitor can hold as this system oscillates? (7 pts, Q25) What is the inductance? (7 pts, Q26) What is the current in the inductor at time t = 0? (7 pts, Q27) What is the maximum current that the inductor can have as the system oscillates?  Enter the maximum charge that the capacitor can hold (part a) here in units of mC.
[20 Points]: Imagine you are buying a new running shoe. You care about 3 criteria: Style, Comfort, and Price. You have narrowed down your search to three alternatives: Nike, Addidas, and Asics. Here are your pairwise comparisons for each criterion. (AKA which criterion do you care about the most.)     A) Solve for the weight matrix (w) for the criterion.  B)  If Nike option is $50, Adidas option is $40, and Asics Option is $55, solve for the score vector (S) for the price of the shoes, with a lower-priced shoe being the more desirable option.  C) The weight matrix (S) for Style and Comfort are given. Using the score matrix and weight vector, solve for the global score vector (v), rank the options (with 1 being the best choice and 3 being the worst choice), and determine which shoe you should choose.      (S)   Aesthetics   Performance   Price      Nike   0.30   0.34         Adidas   0.34   0.23         Asics   0.36   0.44

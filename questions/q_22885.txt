To answer this question, type the sequence of numbers in the correct order.  A T cell uses a CD4 receptor recognizes the antigen on the dendritic cell and forms a complex. The B cell responds to chemical mediators, differentiates, and secretes antibodies. The dendritic cell digests the antigen and displays it using the MHC marker. The CD4 cell differentiates into a T helper cell. A dendritic cell phagocytoses an invader and its antigen. A specific B cell clone processes the antigen, then complexes with the activated T helper cell.

The actual direct labor rate was $19.80 per hour and the actual variable overhead rate was $2.90 per hour. The company applies variable overhead on the basis of direct labor-hours.  The direct materials purchase variance is computed when the materials are purchased. Standard Cost Variance formulas: MPV = AQpurchased * (AP - SP) MQV = SP * (AQused - SQ) LRV = AH * (AR - SR) LEV = SR * (AH - SH) VOhdRV = AH * (AR - SR)  VOhdEV = SR * (AH - SH) REQUIRED:  Compute the following standard rate variances:  Materials Price Variance Materials Quantity Variance Labor Rate Variance Labor Efficiency Variance Variable Overhead Rate Variance Variable Overhead Efficiency Variance

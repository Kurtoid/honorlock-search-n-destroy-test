A 65 year old man is treated for diverticulitis with intervenous amoxicillin/sulbactam so back down for five days. On day five he developed fever, altered mental status, and a chest radiograph revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate. He was intubated and sputum cultures grew a resistant Pseudomonas. His antibiotics were changed to ticarcillin/clavulanate and tobramycin. Two days after the antibiotic change the patient's fever decreased and he was more alert. On day four after change of antibiotics the patient developed a fever of 102degF, his white blood cell count increased from 12,000 to 19,000, and he had several episodes of watery diarrhea. A stool sample was positive for fecal leukocytes and the presence of yeast. Additional medication included intervenous famotidine,  prophylactic low molecular weight heparin, and enteral feeding with an iso-osmotic nutritional product.

Short Answer 4 Nigel is a researcher interested in behavioral enrichment for zoo animals, and wants to investigate the effects of two types of foraging enrichment on chimpanzee behavior.  He plans to compare foraging puzzles, in which the chimps have to extract food out of a central apparatus, to scatter foraging, in which keepers hide and scatter small food bits across the entire enclosure.  Nigel plans to measure the amount of time chimps spend foraging and feeding in each enrichment condition.  One of his lab assistants, Zak, suggests that he run his experiment using an independent-samples design, so that a different set of chimps are used for each enrichment condition.  Nigel's other lab assistant, Bronson, suggests a related-samples design, in which the same set of chimps receives both conditions. a. If all other factors are equal, which design (Zak's or Bronson's) should have greater statistical power? Briefly explain why.  (4 pts.) b. If all other factors are equal, which design should have a greater risk of a Type II error? Briefly explain why.  (3 pts.)

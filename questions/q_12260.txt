Food additives, such as the plant-based extract tara gum, are used in industrial fool preparations as thickening agents to stabilize emulsions and create an impression of thickness and creaminess without adding extra calories.  The effect of tara gum on the viscosity (in millipascal-seconds, mPa.s) of fruit yogurt drinks was assessed for various concentrations of tara gum (in grams per 100 grams of drink, g/100g).  The findings are summarized in the following scatterplot.  The relationship between the viscosity of the yogurt drink and concentration of the tara gum can be described as [a]. Which one of the following is the best guessed value of the correlation coefficient for the viscosity of the yogurt drink and concentration of the tara gum? [b]

Let X equal the distribution of the possible BMIs in children with reported weight problems aged 5-18 years old. Suppose this distribution was approximately normal with u=21.7 and s=1.34. What is the P(X<=18.5)? [response1]. Assuming healthy BMIs for this age range are (17.5-22.5) what proportion of children in this age range is considered to have a healthy BMI? [response2].
Problem 1 A bridge truss is subjected to five vertical forces as shown in the diagram.  Determine the forces in members CE, CF, DF, EF, and EG.        Format:  Enter forces with their units and state if the force is in tension (T) or compression (C). FCE = [force_CE] in [CE_T_or_C] FCF = [force_CF] in [CF_T_or_C] FDF = [force_DF] in [DF_T_or_C] FEF = [force_EF] in [EF_T_or_C] FEG = [force_EG] in [EG_T_or_C]

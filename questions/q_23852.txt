Division G makes a part that it sells to customers outside of the company. Data concerning this part appear below:            Selling price to outside customers $ 87   Variable cost per unit $ 49   Total fixed costs $ 40,000   Capacity in units   4,000        Division H of the same company would like to use the part manufactured by Division G in one of its products. Division H currently purchases a similar part made by an outside company for $83 per unit and would substitute the part made by Division G. Division H requires 500 units of the part each period. Division G has ample capacity to produce the units for Division H without any increase in fixed costs and without cutting into sales to outside customers. If Division G sells to Division H rather than to outside customers, the variable cost be unit would be $2 lower. What should be the lowest acceptable transfer price from the perspective of Division G?
A total of 2.00 mol of a compound is allowed to react with water in a foam coffee cup and the reaction produces [m] g of solution. The reaction caused the temperature of the solution to rise from 21.00 oC  to 24.70 oC. What is the enthalpy of this reaction? Assume that no heat is lost to the surroundings or to the coffee cup itself and that the specific heat of the solution is the same as that of pure water (4.184 J/gdegC).  Enter your answer numerically, in terms of kJ/mol. Be sure to take note as to whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic.

Joe's asthma has been well-controlled for the past 6 months on  controller therapy of Advair 250mcg/50mcg and short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) as needed.  Today he presents with complaint of an upper respiratory infection (URI) that started 1 week ago.  Reports frequent, nonproductive cough that keeps him awake and increased wheezing that requires use of her SABA MDI 6-8 times daily.  Denies fever, chills, nausea or vomiting. On physical exam: appears to be in mild distress, vital signs- T 98.9, P 96, R 22, O2 sat 96%. Lungs have expiratory wheezes throughout bilaterally, with good air movement, no dullness to percussion. The remainder of the physical exam is normal.  Your diagnosis is acute asthma exacerbation.    The most appropriate therapy to initiate at this time includes:

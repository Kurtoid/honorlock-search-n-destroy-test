A beam has the cross-sectional shape shown; the distance from the bottom of the section to the neutral axis is 181 mm, and I = 140.7 x 106 mm4 for this cross-section. At a particular cross-section along the length of the beam, the internal shear force is found to be V = 64 kN and the internal moment is found to be M = -7 kN*m.  Determine the shear stress at a point 100 mm from the bottom of the cross-section. Determine the normal stress at the same point, and state whether it is tensile or compressive.

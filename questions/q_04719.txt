The mRNA vaccines offering protection against COVID-19 are subunit vaccines, meaning that the mRNA that they contain code only for part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus' spike protein). First, an initial dose of vaccine containing a subunit of viral mRNA (i.e. mRNA that codes for the spike protein) is injected into a susceptible individual's (a host's) arm. Then what happens? Put the following steps in the correct order to describe how the vaccines create immunity.  1. An antigen-presenting cell (APC) recognizes the spike protein as an antigen, engulfs it, degrades it, and presents a fragment of the degraded spike protein on its own outer cell membrane. 2. Antibodies against spike protein are produced. 3. A ribosome attaches to the vaccine mRNA and translates it into spike protein, which is moved to the host cell's plasma membrane. 4. T cell recognizes the spike protein fragment as an antigen, and subsequently activates B cell response. 5. The vaccine mRNA enters a host cell.

Abhishek is evaluating an expansion project. With the project, his firm should be able to expand sales by 100,000 at $59 per unit. He is concerned about the variable cost per unit, which he expects to also be $59 per unit. One potential supplier is willing to sell his firm a 6-month option on the materials that his firm would need for expansion. The supplier will accept a payment that would corresponds to a variable cost of $56 per unit. Abhi estimates, from his experience, that the standard deviation of the cost of the materials across all suppliers over the next few months will be 44 percent and the risk-free rate is 3 percent. How much should the firm be willing to pay for this option? (Use the Black-Scholes model and enter your answer rounded to the nearest dollar. You should find the value of the entire order, not on a per unit basis).

In a study of heart surgery, 200 subjects were randomly divided into two groups of 100. One group received a beta-blocker while the other group was given a placebo. The pulse rate at a particular time during the surgery was measured.  Researchers are interested in knowing if beta-blockers reduce the pulse rate at a 5% significance level.    The results are given below.       Population Sample Size Sample Mean  Sample Standard Deviation   1 (Beta-blockers) 100 68.5 7.3   2 (Placebo) 100 70.5 8.6    Complete each space with the appropriate answer Since the researchers [color1], we need a [color2] alternative. We can perform a [color3] since this is a [color4], and sample sizes are [color5]. The SE for the average of group 1 is  [color6], and the SE for the average of group 2 is  [color7], so the SE for the difference of the averages is [color8]. The test statistic is [color9]. The p-value is [color10].  This is [color11] the significance level of 5%, so we will [color12], and conclude that [color13]

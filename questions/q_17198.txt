For your final exam, you will write a response to either "Why Students Hate School Lunches" or "Do Healthy Lunches Improve Student Test Scores?" Once you have selected your reading, you will need to annotate the article, considering the author's argument or point--what is she (yes, both are written by women) communicating to her audience? How does she communicate that message? Does she make wise choices in constructing her argument? In your response, you should identify the claim the author makes and address whether or not you agree with those claims. Be sure that you explain her thoughts even if you disagree with them.         You will be required to cite the article in your essay, so be prepared to use quotations, paraphrase, or summarize the work with proper in-text citations for each use of the author's work. You will also need a Work Cited page attached to the final exam submission that cites the article of your choosing.         You may NOT write the essay in advance, but you can prepare for it by writing a thesis (do NOT plagiarize this sentence as I still have to assign a grade of 0 for plagiarized work), outline, and any additional notes regarding sources and citations that you might like. I'm grading this on your ability to write a good essay, but you should aim for around 750 words.      Breakdown for Clarity:       Introduction--summary of author's ideas; thesis that shows points you agree or disagree with (ex. "Jane Author's points about X and Y are valid, but there are problems with Z.")    Body paragraphs--each address one point you agree or disagree with and WHY. Use quotations to show the claims made in the article. Make sure to avoid first person. "I think the author's point..." and "The author's point..." have the same information.    Conclusion--sum up the discussion. Revisit ideas as needed. Bring everything together.      Important Points:      750-1,000 words (this is rough--just write a good essay)          Essay, not a single paragraph or sentence    Citations included in text and on Work(s) Cited page    Address the prompt completely    Take time to revise and edit--grammar won't be the main focus, but it is still important    Remove ALL contractions (can't, don't, shouldn't, etc.) and second-person pronouns (you, your, etc.) UNLESS they are in a quotation from your source; LIMIT first-person pronouns (I, me, my, we, our, etc.) where you can. Again, "I think/feel/believe" phrases are entirely unnecessary.    Write your essay in the space below.

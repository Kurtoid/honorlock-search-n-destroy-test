VRAAG 4     Gebruik die inligting hieronder om die volgende vrae te beantwoord: Jy stoot 'n blik van 3,5 kg wat op 'n tafelblad rus na regs, en jy moet 'n krag van 2,67 N uitoefen om die blik te laat begin beweeg. As dit eers beweeg, kan jy 'n krag van slegs 1,5 N gebruik om die blik teen 'n konstants spoed te laat beweeg.     4.1   Wat is die grootte en rigting van die normaalkrag?   (2)     4.2   Bereken die statiese wrywingskoeffisient tussen die tafel en die blik.   (2)     4.3   Wat is die grootte en rigting van die kinetiese wrywingskrag?   (2)     4.4   Wat is die resultante/netto krag op die blik terwyl dit beweeg?   (2)     4.5   Teken 'n kragtediagram vir die blik terwyl dit in 'n positiewe rigting na regs beweeg. Maak seker dat jy alle byskrifte en waardes insluit.   (3)             [11]

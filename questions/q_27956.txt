DIRECTIONS: Read the passage. Then choose the correct answers. Write the letter of the correct word on the line before the number.    A Software Program Replaces Police Artists      A new software program can help police perfectly identify criminal suspects. Previously, police depended on sketches or pictures. Police artists drew an image based on the victim's description. While the artist asked questions, he or she added details and the suspect's picture slowly took shape. The accuracy of their work depended on the skill of the police artist.      The Suspect ID Crime Lab is a new software program that people with little artistic ability can use. It is mobile: police technicians are able to move it to crime scenes, hospitals, or victims' homes. The process begins with the victim choosing the basic shape of the suspect's face. Technicians then modify this facial outline to add the suspect's gender and race. Next, the program adds hair type, color, and style. Then experts play with the size and shape of the nose, forehead, chin, neck, or other parts of the face. This includes changes to the dimensions of the eyes. Distinguishing marks, such as scars or tattoos, become part of the picture, too.      Finally, the picture is computerized. This makes it more convenient to transport than a traditional sketch. The image can be stored as a computer file, downloaded for instant review, added to a website, or sent to another police agency as an email attachment. Police officers appreciate this feature.      The victims usually react quite well to this new technology. Most find that the computer images are very accurate. The software is definitely a welcomed improvement for police trying to solve crimes.       1. The Suspect ID Crime Lab is a type of [a1]          2. Police artists [a2]  3.

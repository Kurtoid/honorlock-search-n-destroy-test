Aqueous bleach solution (NaOCl (aq)) reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce sodium chloride solution, water and chlorine gas. What "type" of reaction is this? Write balanced molecular, ionic and net ionic chemical equations describing this process. Do not forget to indicate phases in the chemical equations. Use correct subscripts and superscripts where needed or this question will receive zero points.

The Process of Scientific Investigation (8 points) Disease-suppressive soils are soils which seem to suppress the incidence of disease in crops, even if pathogens are present and environmental conditions would favor disease development.  In many cases, soil microbes have been shown to be involved in disease suppression and it has been proposed that the introduction of these microbes into diseased soils might serve as a natural way to suppress disease and would be less damaging to the environment than current disease control methods that involve the application of toxic chemicals such as fungicides.   To test this form of natural disease control, a scientist obtains soil which appears to suppress the incidence of a disease in sugar beets caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani and isolates from this soil three bacterial species (A, B, and C) that might play a role in disease suppression.  Next, she prepares 4 soils.  Soil A is sterile potting mix inoculated with bacterium A, soil B is sterile potting mix inoculated with bacterium B, soil C is sterile potting mix inoculated with bacterium C and soil D is sterile potting mix lacking bacteria.  All four soils are also inoculated with the pathogen Rhizoctonia solani.  Finally, she fills 4 trays with each of the 4 soils (16 trays in total) and plants 50 sugar beet seeds per tray. After 30 days, she records the number of seedlings exhibiting disease symptoms in each tray. The results are in the table below:       Tray   Soil A   Soil B   Soil C   Soil D     1   45   5   42   47     2   44   10   40   45     3   43   3   49   44     4   48   9   44   49      In the space below, answer the following set of questions.  State the hypothesis being tested in this experiment. What is the dependent variable? What is the independent variable?  What soil serves as the control treatment? How many replicates exist per treatment? Name 2 other variables that should be controlled though out the course of this experiment. According to the results in the table, which bacterium is most promising as a form of biological disease control?

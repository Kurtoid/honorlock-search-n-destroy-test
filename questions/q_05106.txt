Environmentalists studying the effect of fire on the nutrients in soil measured the calcium level in randomly selected soil samples for 8 plots before and after a prescribed burn. Before the burn, the mean calcium level was 66.8 kg/plot, and the standard deviation was 14.65 kg/plot.  Here are the measurements for these plots after the burn:       9,    18,   36,   24,   18,   12,   25,   26   The type of graph being used to display calcium levels after the burn is called a [a]. The shape of the distribution of calcium levels after the burn is [b]. The environmentalists conducting the study want to estimate the mean calcium level after the burn using these eight randomly selected after-burn soil samples. To do so, they should use a(n) [c].

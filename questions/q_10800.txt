A farmer making grape juice fills a glass bottle to the brim and caps it tightly. The juice expands more than the glass when it warms up, in such a way that the volume increases by 0.3% (that is, DV/V0=3x10-3) relative to the space available. Calculate the force exerted by the juice per square centimeter if its bulk modulus is 1.8x109N/m2, assuming the bottle does not break. Show in detail how you get to the solution of the problem.

Carbon monoxide (CO) in fire-related deaths is well established. It is the leading cause of smoke-related fatalities, accounting for up to 80% of deaths. Reducing carboxyhemoglobin is the mainstay of treatment in CO poisoning.   A 38-year-old man is brought in to the rural emergency department by a family member who pulled him out of a house fire in a remote location of the county. The man is obtunded and soot is apparent on his clothing. He has no dermal burns. The AG-ACNP orders a carboxyhemoglobin level and places the man on oxygen at 6L/min. via nasal cannula. The carboxyhemoglobin report reveals a level of 35%.   Which of the following next steps would be the best approach for treatment in this setting?   A. No additional treatment needed, monitor level of consciousness and repeat carboxyhemoglobin level in 6 hours B. No additional treatment needed, monitor level of consciousness and repeat carboxyhemoglobin level in 1 hour C. Increase oxygen to 100% non-rebreather mask, monitor level of consciousness and repeat carboxyhemoglobin level in 1 hour D.Increase oxygen to 100% non-rebreather mask, monitor level of consciousness, consider air flight transfer to regional trauma center tomorrow for hyperbaric oxygen therapy

PROCEDURE:  Placement of a dual chamber pacemaker INDICATIONS:  Patient with symptomatic sick sinus syndrome, bradycardia, alternating with symptomatic palpitations and tachycardia PROCEDURE:  After informed consent the patient is brought to the lab.  The procedure was done under conscious sedation, fluoroscopic guidance.  One percent lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin under the left clavicle and a subcutaneous pocket was made for the pacemaker generator and leads.  The left subclavian vein was cannulated twice using a micro puncture set, which was upsized to regular 035 wire, the position of which was confirmed under fluoro. A 7-French sheath and a 7-French right ventricular lead was used and placed in the right ventricular apex originally and then more proximally in the inferior wall.  The numbers were suboptimal, including the R-wave sensing.  I then moved the lead to the right ventricular mid to upper septum.  The numbers were better. There was no diaphragmatic stimulation, and the lead was sutured down.  This was an active fixation lead.   The right atrial lead was then placed using a 7-French sheath under under fluoroscopic guidance.  The numbers looked good.  There was not diaphragmatic stimulation,  and the lead was sutured down.  The leads were then attached to the generator, which was sutured down in the pocket.  Wound irrigated and antibiotic and inspected for hemostasis and closed in layers.  Patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  (Do not code the fluoroscopic guidance)

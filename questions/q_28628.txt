Compound Semiconductor Alloys:  You wish to grow a laser diode on an InP substrate which can emit 1.55 mm light and have no dislocation in the epitaxial layer.   Please explain why neither InGaAs nor InAlAs ternary alloys can be used for this purpose? (6 points) Please explain why there is a transition from indirect band gap to direct band gap for InxAl1-xAs as x varies from 0 to 1? (6 points) The quaternary InxGayAl1-x-yAs could be used to meet the requirements. Please calculate the required compositions (i.e., values of x and y) of InxGayAl1-x-yAs.  The alloy bowing parameter for InxGa1-xAs is 0.45 eV and that for AlxGa1-xAs in the direct bandgap composition region is 0.70 eV. (10 points)

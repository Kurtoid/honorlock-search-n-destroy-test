Part 2. The following 12 short essay questions are designed to evaluate critical thinking/reasoning skills, please make sure that you provide the most detailed answer you can.  You do not need to answer all of the questions.  What you need to do is choose 2 the following questions to answer on the attached sheets of paper (correctly number which questions you chose). If you answer more than two questions, only the first two will be graded. (5 pts. each) 1) The human population has greatly increased during the last 10,000 years, especially during the last 200 years or so.  Describe at least three reasons for this dramatic increase in the human population and how it aided in increasing the human population? 2) What are two ways that humans can control the growth rate of the human population?  What are some of the negative political and/or social consequences of the options you chose? 3) Explain how soil can be considered the interface between the geosphere, biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere?  Why is it so important to maintain/protect our soil resources (hint: think about not only what it provides, but what it takes to replace soil). 4) Briefly explain what the Theory of Plate Tectonics states about Earth's crust.  Why is important to understand this theory in regards to mineral resources, environmental hazards, and human protection?  5) Ecologist Garrett Hardin described the concept "tragedy of the commons".  What is meant by this phrase and provide an environmental example (in your own words) of a "tragedy of the commons." 6) Briefly explain the governmental policy of land zoning.  How can proper zoning reduce urban blight and slow the urban sprawl? 7) Describe the differences between no-till farming and conventional farming.

(Hint: think about what needs to increase in order to maintain a healthy crop). 8) Describe what aquaculture is, why it is important to maintain natural fisheries, and what some of the environmental challenges associated with aquaculture are. 9) Describe in detail the Hubbert Curve for peak oil production.  Discuss what the curve represents, in regards to, what will occur when we reach peak oil and the lower and upper estimates of petroleum reserves. 10) The three fossil fuels have a number of environmental hazards associated with them that are not associated with nuclear power.  List two environmental hazards associated with the fossil fuels (and not with nuclear power) and then discuss why nuclear power (e.g., fission) has not grown in popularity and some of the challenges that are unique to nuclear power generation. 11) Discuss at least two distinct environmentally sound ways that humans can maximize our energy resources, specifically how each of the options you chose can reduce our energy demand, what fossil fuel we would need less, and what renewable energy source would potentially provide that energy demand in the future. 12) Discuss why the argument can be made that no one single renewable energy source will solve our future energy demands.  Provide at least two real-world examples to support your response.

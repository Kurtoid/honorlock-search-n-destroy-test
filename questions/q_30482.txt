A researcher conducts an experiment to determine the relative effectiveness of three medications designed to control LDL cholesterol levels in female patients with moderate-to-high cholesterol levels. Patients are recruited and randomly assigned to take one of the three medications over a 6-month period. At the end of the study, the LDL cholesterol level of each patient is measured. The researcher is concerned about the impact of the overall health of the patients on their LDL cholesterol levels; therefore, the body mass index (BMI) of each patient is also recorded as a covariate. SPSS was used to conduct an analysis of covariance (all underlying assumptions were checked and found to be valid). The tables below provide a portion of the SPSS output. Use the tables (as needed) to answer this question.  Table 6A      Table 6B         Do the following:  State the null and alternative hypotheses for the analysis of covariance test, make a decision about the null hypothesis, and write a conclusion statement. If appropriate, use the Bonferroni post hoc analysis to identify all pairs of adjusted treatment means that are statistically significantly different. Justify your conclusions.

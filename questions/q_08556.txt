Which of the following sentences expresses the main idea of the paragraph? A.  In Latin, plagiarism means "kidnapper." B. To plagiarize means to use another person's words or ideas as if they were one's own original creations. Quite simply, it is theft. Common thieves steal material goods that legally belong to others and then use this property as if it were rightfully theirs. Plagiarists do the same with words and ideas. C. This theft can occur in three forms: global, patchwork, and incremental. Global plagiarism is stealing all the words and ideas from another source and passing them off as one's own. This is the most blatant kind of plagiarism and is considered to be grossly unethical. Patchwork plagiarism occurs when words and ideas are pilfered from several sources and patched together. In other words, instead of copying everything from one single source, the thief copies word for word from several sources. D. In global and patchwork plagiarism, entire sections are copied verbatim. A third kind of plagiarism, incremental plagiarism, occurs when small portions (choice words or phrases) are borrowed from different parts of one source without proper credit being given.

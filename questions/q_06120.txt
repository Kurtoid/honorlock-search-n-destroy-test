Species Diversity in Communities  C. Recent experimental work in ecology has shown a relationship between species diversity and community functions. There is considerable debate about these relationships and their controlling mechanisms. There are at least three hypotheses/predictions for these relationships (Figure 1.). Match the graphs (you can use the labels i., ii., and iii.) to their correct hypothesis (Idiosyncratic hypothesis, complementary hypothesis, and redundancy hypothesis). (3pts) i.  ii.  iii.

An objective function and a system of linear inequalities representing constraints are given. Graph the system of inequalities representing the constraints. Find the value of the objective function at each corner of the graphed region. Use these values to determine the maximum value of the objective function and the values of x and y for which the maximum occurs.Objective Function z = 6x + 7yConstraints x >= 0y >= 02x + 3y <= 122x + y <= 8

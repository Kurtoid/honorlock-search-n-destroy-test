Answer 4 of the following 6 questions:  A: Describe the differences between alpha and gamma motor neurons. Describe and compare their anatomical connections within a muscle. What are their relative functional roles? (2-3 sentences) B: The basal ganglia contains two different pathways (direct and indirect) that contain disinhibitory circuits. Describe the brain areas involved in the direct pathway and what their net impact is within the circuit (i.e., excitation or inhibition). What is the impact of stimulation of increased drive onto the direct pathway? What part of the basal ganglia (direct pathway) is altered in Parkinson's disease, and how does this alter the circuit?  C: Describe at least two kinds of experimental evidence that the premotor area (Area 6) is important for motor planning. The descriptions should include both the experiment as well as the physiological response.  D: Compare and contrast the control of the hypothalamus by the anterior and posterior pituitary. Be explicit with respect to the connections from the hypothalamus, and which chemicals are released (at least 1 each from the posterior and anterior). E: Explain how volumetric thirst is triggered (volumetric referring to changes in blood volume, not changes in concentration of blood solutes). Describe the mechanism by which it is detected, and the signaling circuits and pathways involved.  F: Describe how elevated leptin alters processing in the brain. The answer should include details with respect to which neurons are activated, their projection targets, and the different roles of those projections (i.e., humoral, visceromotor and somatic responses).

"By the 1930s, many Europeans were ready to leave behind the liberal, democratic order created after 1918 by Britain, France, and the United States for a more authoritarian future. What they did not bargain for was the brutal reality of Nazi imperialism and the denial of all national aspirations apart from German ones. . . . No experience was more crucial to the development of Europe in the twentieth century. As both Hitler and Stalin were well aware, the Second World War involved something far more profound than a series of military engagements and diplomatic negotiations; it was a struggle for the social and political future of the continent itself. And such was the shock of being subjected to a regime of unprecedented and unremitting violence that in the space of eight years a sea-change took place in Europeans' political and social attitudes, and they rediscovered the virtues of democracy. . . . Hitler's war aimed at the complete racial reconstitution of Europe. There were no historical parallels for such a project. In Europe, neither Napoleon nor the Habsburgs had aimed at gaining such exclusive domination. In its violence and racism, Nazi imperialism drew more from European precedents in Asia, Africa, and--especially--the Americas. 'When we eat wheat from Canada,' remarked Hitler one evening during the war, 'we don't think about the despoiled Indians.' On another occasion he described the Ukraine as [Germany's] 'new Indian Empire.' But if Europeans would have resented being ruled as the British ruled India, they were shocked at being submitted to an experience closer to that inflicted upon the native populations of the Americas." Mark Mazower, British historian, Dark Continent: Europe's Twentieth Century, 2000         Based on the passage, it can be inferred that Mazower might also support which of the following assertions?

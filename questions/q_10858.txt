You are conducting a study to see if there's a difference between the number of finger corals in two different Florida coral reefs. After conducting your experiment, collecting your data, and analyzing the data using a t-test, you get the following results: t4 = 0.1141, p = 0.9146. How would you interpret these results about the numbers of finger corals in the two different coral reefs?

Use the multi-cycle datapath diagram for the following question.  For a single cycle processor X assume the following: 200 ps for memory operations100 ps for ALU operations50 ps for register file access (disregard the delay for all other datapath components such as multiplexors and control unit) If both a single cycle datapath X and the multi-cycle datapath Y (as shown above) are running the same benchmark consisting of the following instruction mix: 20% ld, 13% sd, 11% branch, 56% ALU instr Calculate the clock cycle time for the single cycle processor in ps.
When Lauren and Trevor experience conflict, Lauren typically dominates the conversation whereas Trevor typically "shuts down." The more Trevor avoids discussing the problem, the more frustrated Lauren gets, and the more frustrated and angry Lauren becomes, the more Trevor shrinks back from the conflict. This is an example of

GENTLE REMINDER: Please read this page carefully as some directions are different.  If any of the testing policies given below or in our course syllabus are violated, a score of zero will be given.  Since this is the final exam, the likelihood of passing the course if this score is a zero is greatly diminished.    And PLEASE remember that I may be reviewing your video.      1.    A form of government-issued photo ID is required to take this Final (your driver's license or your Student Hawkcard is fine).    You have 3 hours to complete this Final Exam (unless you have accommodations that state otherwise).   After you submit it, you will have an additional fifteen minutes to upload your work and email it to me. See Step 8 for further instructions.     This is a closed-book, closed-notes Final Exam. YOU MUST SIT AT A DESK, TABLE OR ON THE FLOOR.  YOU MAY NOT SIT ON YOUR BED. Nothing (including slips of paper) should be within your workspace during the test except your computer, a pencil or two, eraser, three blank sheets of paper, and a scientific calculator. No markings on your body (other than tattoos) are allowed.      PLEASE DO  THE FOLLOWING VERY SLOWLY:  * Show your calculator (without the cover), the 3 blank pages of scrap paper front AND back, and your workspace to the webcam before you begin the test. You will then be asked to do a room scan. You should be completely alone in a closed room where you can be sure no interruptions will occur.  AGAIN, DO THIS SLOWLY PLEASE.          Websites CAN NOT be opened.     Electronic devices (other than your calculator) cannot be used.      No restroom breaks are allowed during the final exam (unless your accommodations state otherwise).

After you submit your Final Exam, you need to upload all your work  to jsibol@hccfl.edu. within fifteen minutes after submitting it. You may use your smartphone camera or a scanner to do this.  YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ALTER, ADD, OR DELETE ANY WORK ON YOUR SCRAP PAPER!  Any work you send me must support the answers you gave on the final and any answers on your scrap work that do not match the answers provided on the final may or may not be considered. I reserve the right to accept or reject the authenticity of any work provided to me.   GOOD LUCK.....YOU GOT THIS!! Janet

You would like to measure a signal, which can be modelled as a Gaussian random variable with 1.0V mean and 0.2V standard deviation. If you measure this signal with your instrument, it will be subject to instrument noise and the measured signal will be the sum of the noise and the signal.  Noise of your instrument can also be modelled as a Gaussian random variable with 0.1V mean and 0.1V standard deviation. Write out the exact expression to represent the PDF of the measured signal, Z.

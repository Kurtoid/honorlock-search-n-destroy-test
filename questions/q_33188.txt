The response of a trait to selection can be accurately estimated if both the heritability and the strength of selection on that trait are known, as both of these values are directly proportional to the trait's response to selection. However, in natural populations, it is often much easier to measure the response to selection than it is to measure the strength of selection. If the heritability (h2) of a trait is known, and the response to selection in a population can be measured (R), then the selection differential (s) can be estimated. How?

Use the ribbon worksheet (in the data file provided for the exam). A company manufactures ribbon for thermal transfer printing. Different types of printers use different sizes of ribbons. The company has forecasted demand for different ribbon sizes. The rolls from which ribbons are cut are 1,900 mm in length. Scrap is valued at $0.09 per millimeter. The company has five different cutting patterns, so each ribbon size can be cut from at least one pattern. Construct and solve an optimization model for finding the number of patterns to cut to meet demand while minimizing trim loss (defined as total scrap value). The amount of each pattern utilized should be a whole number. What is the total scrap/trim loss resulting from the optimized solution?

A colleague is proposing to investigate the chapter review quizzes on student test performance comparing two groups of 10 students who either do or do not complete review quizzes prior to the exam. The researcher's power analysis indicated that they would have a power of .3490 for this study using a two-tailed test and an alpha level of .05. What advice would you give this researcher when they ask if they should conduct this study? What are the possible strategies that they could use to increase their power, and which of these do you recommend?

The Cameron Corporation manufactures custom-made purses. The following data pertains to Job XY5:     Direct materials placed into production $4,000   Direct labor hours worked 50 hours   Direct labor rate per hour $15   Machine hours worked 100 hours     Factory overhead is applied using a plant-wide rate based on direct labor hours. Factory overhead was budgeted at $80,000 for the year and the direct labor hours were estimated to be 20,000. Job XY5 consists of 50 units. What the total cost assigned to Job XY5?
Remember, once time runs out, it is too late to upload your Simio file without significant penalty in points so watch the clock. This is an open notes (closed book) test.  You can also use the Simio Help system. When you are finished, close Simio, then upload the Simio file before time runs out. Problem Description This model must have exactly two sources, exactly three servers, and exactly one sink.  Movement from a source to the first workstation is instantaneous.  Travel time between workstations is 5 minutes.  Travel distance from the final workstation to the sink is 1 mile and all entities travel at a speed of 10 kilometers per hour from the final workstation to the sink. This system consists of two part types (blue type and green type) and three single server systems called A, B, and C.  Blue arrivals occur 24/7 according to a Poisson process with rate 5 per hour.  During the daytime, from 6AM until 6PM, the blue arrivals are sent to A, and from 6PM until 6PM, blue arrivals are sent to B.  (Note, servers A and B operate 24/7 as long as there are parts waiting to be processed.)  After an entity is finished at A, it continues to C, then out of the system after C.  After an entity is finished at B, it continues to C, then out of the system after C.  For modeling purposes, have only one source for blue arrivals and color those entities blue.  For sending entities from the Blue Source to either WS A or WS B, use an Add-on Process.  Red arrivals occur 24/7 according to a Poisson process with a rate of 60 per day.  All red arrivals are sent directly to C, and after C they leave the system.  For modeling purposes, have one source for red arrivals and color those entities red.  Have only one sink for loading dock (i.e., for parts leaving the system). The processing time at Server A and B are both exponentially distributed with mean 10 minutes.  The processing time for a blue part on Server C is deterministic and equals 5 minutes.  The processing time for a red part on Server C is deterministic and equals 10 minutes.  Consider the subsystem formed by Server C, its queue, and the path leading to the loading dock.  Your results tab should show at least three quantities:  (1) the long-run average number of parts (both blue and red) in the subsystem, (2) the average number of minutes a blue part spends in the subsystem, and (3) the total daily throughput of parts.  I would like to see these numbers in the Results tab without having to do any calculations myself (for example, I don't want to multiply hours by 60 to get minutes, minutes should appear; likewise, a single value for daily throughput should also appear in the Results tab.)  Hint, for the tally, you may want to use an Add-on Process with a Decide Step.  Give the theoretical daily throughput in a Floor Label. Run your model for 50 days.  To save time, you do not need to create an experiment. You may not use the Math.If(  ) function.  If there are several ways to accomplish a specific task and no method is specifically mentioned, you may choose whichever you like best.  If a method is used that is extremely complex and an easier method is available, you may lose points for not understanding the straightforward method.  Use a floor label for comments or assumptions that you want me to see.

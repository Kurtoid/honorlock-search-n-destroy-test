Glycolysis is not the only metabolic pathway for glucose utilization.  This problem explores the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (shown below), named for its discoverers.  The net result of the pathway is that a molecule of glucose is converted to two molecules of CO2 plus two molecules of ethanol.  Note that the reactions from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to pyruvate are identical to those used in glycolysis.  Can glucose metabolism by the Entner-Doudoroff pathway proceed indefinitely in the absence of a functioning citric acid cycle (in other words, in the absence of oxygen)?

Read the following scenario and answer the question below. In the early years of the 20th century there were lush stands of tall grasses in the valley on the east side of the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona, stretching to Mexico on the south and New Mexico on the east. Dramatic summer rainstorms dumped huge amounts of water, very quickly, on the rocky upper slopes. The water ran down the slopes and into the grasslands, where it quickly soaked into the soft, porous soil where prairie dogs were active. Cattle-ranching was in full swing, utilizing the rich grasses, but the ranchers did not appreciate the multitudes of prairie dogs that lived in the grasslands. Prairie dogs constantly dug through soil, making new burrows and eating grasses, roots and all. It was commonly believed that cattle and horses would stumble in the prairie dog holes and break their legs. In addition, many ranchers were convinced that the prairie dogs would destroy the grasses because they directly competed with the cattle for food. The ranchers had already done away with most predators that might possibly affect cattle (coyotes, bobcats, wolves, mountain lions, eagles, and rattlesnakes), and now they turned their attention to the prairie dogs. The ranchers became a part of a new federally sponsored movement to poison the grassland prairie dogs. This movement took root and spread through the 1920s and 1930s. Which of the predators listed would seem to pose the least threat to cattle ranching?

A block of mass m1=3000g and a block of mass m2=7000g are connected by a massless string over a pulley in the shape of a solid disk having a radius R=20cm and mass M=12,000g. The fixed, wedge shaped ramp makes an angle of 37o as shown in the figure.  The coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.3 for both blocks.  The moment of inertia of the pulley is I = 1/2MR2. Final Figure Q2.pdf    Draw the free body diagrams. Determine the friction force acting on m1. Determine the friction force acting on m2. Determine the acceleration of the two blocks. Determine the torque on the pulley.

I'm interested in examining whether heroin reduces pain. I give 10 human subjects the same dose of heroin every day for 2 weeks and then administer a strong shock. Afterwards, I ask them to rate their pain. On the first few days, subjects report experiencing no pain, but as the days go on, they report feeling more and more pain, even though the level of shock has been kept constant. On day 14, there is a fire in my research lab so I have to conduct the last administration at the local hospital. On this day, all subjects report that they don't experience any pain following administration of heroin, even though they reported substantial pain from the same shock the day before. What process can best account for these findings?

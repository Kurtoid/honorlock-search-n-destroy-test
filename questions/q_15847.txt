Two low-friction carts approach each other with the same speed on a level track. The mass 3m of one cart is three times the mass m of the other cart.

It is observed that, after the collision, the cart with mass 3m is not moving at all, and the cart with mass m is moving in the opposite direction to its initial motion.

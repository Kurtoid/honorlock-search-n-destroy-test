A 10 year old comatose patient is in a long term care facility and has been on a ventilator for 8 years.  Secretion overproduction occurs in long term patients due to infection and irritation of the tracheostomy tube. The ventilator is connected via long tubing to a tracheostomy tube and as you walk into the patient's room, you notice a lot of thick white secretions in the ventilator circuit, around the tracheostomy and coming out of the patient's mouth.  The patient's caregiver is in the room and states "Don't worry about all those secretions.  The patient does that when he wants attention."        The caregiver's assumption is that the patient only produces secretions if he/she wants attention.

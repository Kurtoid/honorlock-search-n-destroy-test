I've hypothesized that the amount of time birds spend preparing a nest positively impacts the number of baby birds that survive long enough to fledge (acquire the feathers needed for flight and independent activity). I've predicted that birds who spend over 1 week building their nest will have significantly more babies fledge the nest than birds who spend less than 1 week building their nest. Results: Birds that spent over 1 week building the nest: 2.5 baby birds fledged on average Birds that spent less than 1 week building the nest: 3.4 baby birds fledged on average P-value from the statistical test: 0.04   Is my hypothesis supported? Why or why not?

(Chapter 20) The Controller of Nip-it-in-the-Bud Inc. has studied the possibility of implementing a JIT production system. The company is currently producing (and selling) 20,000 units, with a contribution margin of $10 per unit. The annual incremental retooling costs of the JIT system is projected to be about $67,000 however, the new system will lower annual insurance costs by $10,000 and storage costs will drop by $20,000 a year as the company will be able to reuse warehouse space for other strategic purposes.  In addition, material handling costs will drop by $10,000 a year and because of a resulting increase in quality and faster delivery, the company's contribution margin per unit will increase by $2.00 and sales of units will increase by 5%.  Required:  Calculate the net annual incremental benefit of the JIT system implementation. Use a negative sign if income would be reduced.

By answering "True" to this question, you agree that you will follow the rules below, and that there is NO REASON that you are unable to take this exam at this time.  Student Handbook: If a student experiences a personal, family, or health crisis prior to an exam and the student does not feel adequately prepared for the exam the student is responsible to speak with the faculty member, proctor, and/or nursing administrator prior to the exam to seek an alternate exam date.          A reminder about the following rules for examinations: including those you take in a distance learning environment) No personal belongings may be taken with you including cell phones, smart devices, Apple or other smartwatches, hats, & handbags.  Nothing is to be on the student's desk during exams.   Positively no communication between students during the examination is permitted.  Students may not share information about an examination with other students  If the student is late for an examination, no additional time will be given for the examination. Cell phones are to be turned off not on vibrate and placed out of reach/sight. Only a simple calculator is to be used.  The student may not use a cell phone or watch.  Students will be asked to remove their watch during an exam. If there is an emergency, please contact the instructor (by email)  immediately. *********Note the grade posted immediately after the exam is not your grade.  The exam must be reviewed for accuracy by the Professor.  Official grades for the exam will be announced by the Professor**********

Write a JavaFX GUI program with file name LastnameFirstnameExam5.java that meets the following requirements and adheres to the layout included sketch.  Must set the title of the window to be "1331 Exam 5 - YOURNAME", where YOURNAME is replaced with your first and last name. Must include some non-editable text at the top to the window (not the title) with a short phrase of your choosing. Change the text font to either Georgia, Papyrus, Courier New, or Comic Sans MS; it cannot be the default font. Font size should be 12. Must include a plain Button.  The button must toggle the color of the short phrase between Color.BLACK and your favorite color.  Make sure this color is still visible in the UI (i.e. the color should be dark enough to be seen). You must set the button text to something of your choosing.   Must include one of the following shapes: Rectangle, Polygon, Ellipse, or Arc. The shape can be a color of your choosing, but make sure this color is still visible in the UI (i.e. the color should be dark enough to be seen).  If you choose to use an Ellipse, it cannot be circular. Changes to the rotation amount must be easily observed.   Must include a select one-of-many button group to control the alignment of the shape displayed. There should be 3 alignment options for Left, Center, and Right.  Hint: StackPane has a setAlignment method. You may place this group beside or below the shape.  In order to actually see the alignment change you will need to ensure that your window/stage is large enough. So, you need to set the size of your stage to be large enough to see the change proportional to the the size of your shape. A good ratio is to make the window 3 times the width and height of the Shape. To do this you can use the following methods: stage.setMinWidth(X); and stage.setMinHeight(Y);   Must use a Slider UI control that will control the rotation of the shape.  The Slider's major tick labels should be displayed (setShowTickLabels)  The Slider should have a minimum value of 0, maximum value of 359, and initial value of 0, Hint: Rotation amount can be changed using setRotate Another Hint: Look closely at Slider's constructors to find one that allows for configuration of the min/max/init values on creation of the Slider to make your life easier. Yet Another Hint: There are several ways to implement the event handling, we recommend using the setOnMouseReleased method that is available to any Node   You must use at least one of the following children of Pane to control the layout of the Nodes: BorderPane, GridPane, HBox, or VBox. You must implement your event handling at least two of the three ways we taught: named inner class, anonymous inner class, and lambda expression.  For example, at least one handler as an anonymous inner class and at least one handler as a lambda expression. Failure to implement handlers in two different ways will result in the loss of points.   Points may be deducted if your layout deviates greatly from the one shown below. However, you do not need to have a border around the pane containing your shape nor around the shape itself. You may place the one-of-many button group below or beside the Shape.  YOUR SHOULD ONLY SUBMIT A SINGLE JAVA FILE. ENSURE THAT ANY OTHER CLASSES YOU INCLUDE EXIST WITHIN THE SAME FILE. IF YOUR SUBMITTED CODE DOES NOT COMPILE, YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO. SAVE, BACKUP, AND TEST OFTEN! The following is an example layout for your UI, but as long as you meet the requirements stated above the layout is flexible:

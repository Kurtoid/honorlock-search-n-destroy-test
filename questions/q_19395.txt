12.  Below is the 5' to 3' sequence of DNA that codes for part of a helix-loop-helix protein.  This portion of DNA codes for either the loop or part of a helix.       a) Use the given base sequence to construct both the mRNA sequence coded by the DNA and the protein coded by the mRNA.  You may use 1- or 3-letter code for the protein sequence.  For 4 pts extra credit, you may construct the 3' to 5' DNA sequence from which the mRNA is built, but doing so is not necessary.  (6 pts - 3 pts mRNA; 3 pts protein)   5' to 3':  A T T C T T G A C A A A G C G A C T G A A T A T A T T C A G T A C A T G   3' to 5':   mRNA:   protein:        b) Examine the amino acid sequence you have found.  Does it code for a loop or an alpha-helix?  Point out three features of the amino acid sequence that support your conclusion.  (6 pts)

The following are major steps in the process of endochondral ossification:                Blood vessels invade the perichondrium. Secondary ossification center form & epiphysis fill with spongy bone Chondrocytes enlarge and matrix begins to calcify Osteoblasts form spongy bone within the center shaft at the primary ossification center Osteoclasts break down some spongy bone to create a marrow cavity

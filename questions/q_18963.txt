In performing the image quality test using a mammographic phantom, at least ________ objects of various sizes must be visualized.
(Continues from the preceding question.) About one-third of persons with HCM show abnormal blood pressure regulation during exercise, causing a decrease in MAP. This results in part from a large fall in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) during exercise, which appears to be caused at least in part by inappropriate responses in blood vessels of non-exercising muscle. In a typical person without cardiovascular disease, an increase in cardiac output with exercise from 5 L/min to 15 L/min may be associated with an increase in MAP from 95 mm Hg to 105 mm Hg. In this case, the total systemic vascular resistance during exercise must have [SVR] compared to the SVR at rest. According to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, if the resistance to flow in a blood vessel falls by 50% due to a change in blood vessel diameter, the diameter must have [SVR2]. Therefore, if the problem with SVR during exercise in persons with HCM is due to the responses of blood vessels in non-exercising muscle, these vessels must inappropriately [ExerciseResponse] during exercise.

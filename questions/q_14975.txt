A client has ingested lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Which environment should the nurse create?
Dean likes to practice guitar in his apartment, working primarily on mastering old Velvet Underground songs.  Because he's sure that developing guitar prowess will lead to riches - or at least critical acclaim in indie circles - he derives $500 in surplus from being able to practice.  Dean's practicing, however, is quite loud and can be heard clearly through paper-thin walls in his hip Brooklyn apartment.  Britta lives next door and likes to read, but she is unable to do so when Dean plays guitar.   She gets $350 in surplus from the satisfaction of reading.  Suppose that when Dean and Britta bargain, they always split any surplus to be divided evenly. Assume that it's common knowledge that courts always overestimate damages by $200, and transaction costs are $50.  Given these assumptions, which of the following legal rules is most efficient:

You are studying the Serotonin transporter (SERT) that pumps the neurotransmitter, serotonin, out of the synapse (extracellular) back into the cytosol of the pre-synaptic neuron. Prozac is in a class of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) that effectively block reuptake of serotonin from the synapse thereby prolonging the effect of serotonin release. To characterize this type of transport, you measure the rate of transport of serotonin and two other neurotransmitters, and compile the following table given below. Based on the data in the table below, what statement about the Serotonin transporter (SERT) is TRUE?

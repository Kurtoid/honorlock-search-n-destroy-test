Which of the following statements best describes the experience of the Paleo-Indians during the Clovis era?
An implementation of RSA performs exponentiation by going through the exponent one bit at a time. For a bit in the exponent, it squares the result - this is done regardless of what the value of the exponent's bit is. Then, only if the exponent's bit is tested, the result is multiplied with the message (in this code, exp, res, and msg are large numbers, and each of them occupies thousands of bytes in memory): // For each bit in the exponentfor(int bit_idx=nbits-1; bit_idx>=0; bit_idx--){   BN_sqr(res,res); // res=res*res;   // Get bit_idx'th bit from large number exp   bool bit= get_bit_at_index(exp,bit_idx);   if(bit)      BN_mul(res,res,msg); // res=res*msg} While Betty is using this RSA implementation to sign a message, Evan is running his attack application on the same server, so that Betty's RSA signing program and Evan's attack program share the cache. Before Evan can successfully perform a Prime+Probe attack and discover Betty's secret exponent, he needs to know (or find out) a few facts. Answer the following questions:  Evan needs to know (or write test programs that measure) a few parameters of the cache on the server system. Name at least one property of the server's cache hardware that Evan really must know. Explain why Evan must know the value of that cache property. Evan needs to know something about the data use in the large-number exponentiation code use by Betty. Name at least one variable and at least one property of that variable that Evan must know. Explain why Evan must know that specific fact about that specific variable.

6.  Consider a gamma distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 5.   a.  What is the scale parameter for distribution? [scale] b.  What is the shape parameter for the distribution? [shape] c.  What is the value of the gamma random variate with mean 10 and standard deviation 5 that would be generated by a random number equal to 0.421?  Round your answer to three digits to the right of the decimal.  You may want to use Excel. [rv]
The specific group of people studied in a research project are the "sample." Regardless of how the sample is selected, from where do we say it is directly selected (or "pulled" or even "drawn")? (Choose the correct answer)
Delaware Corp. prepared a master budget that included $21,360 for direct materials, $33,600 for direct labor, $18,000 for variable overhead, and $46,440 for fixed overhead. Delaware Corp. planned to sell 4,000 units during the period, but actually sold 4,300 units. What would Delaware's direct materials cost be if it used a flexible budget for the period based on actual sales?

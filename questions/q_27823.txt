Flabch, Inc. had net sales in 2018 of $800,000 . At December 31, 2018, before adjusting entries, accounts receivable had a $127,000 debit balance and allowance for doubtful accounts had a $1200 credit balance. Flabch estimates that 5% of its receivables will prove to be uncollectible. What is the net realizable value of the receivables reported on the statement of financial position at December 31, 2018 after adjusting entries?
If conventionalism (cultural moral relativism) is true, then moral debate about anything (redefining marriage, adultery, polyamory, pederasty, how a president or SCOTUS justice or senator should act in office, etc..) becomes meaningless.   Why?
Compute the definite integral as the limit of Riemann sums. For credit, you must take the limit of the appropriate Riemann sum.  Using any other technique will not earn points. You must use the graphical equation editor to show all appropriate work, using correct notation.  Improperly supported work will not receive credit.  [?]-22x2dx{"version":"1.1","math":"[?]-22x2dx"}

Project: HOPE Design  a 7-segment decoder that determines two-bit logical input (using the switches on the BASYS 3 trainer board), and generates output on the 7-segment display as shown in the following table:    7-segment Display S(1) S(0)    0 0    0 1    1 0    1 1       If both switches are OFF, the 7-segment has to display capital letter 'H'. If the switch S(0) is ON and S(1) is OFF, the 7-segment has to display capital letter 'O'. If the switch S(0) is OFF and S(1) is ON, the 7-segment has to display capital letter 'P'. If both switches are ON, the 7-segment has to display capital letter 'E'.  To achieve this, you have to derive the Boolean expression for each segment of the 7-segment display: a, b, c, d, e, f, and g by using the method of your choice (Karnaugh map, minterm or maxterm).  The 7-segment display on BASYS 3 board is active low, meaning...  logical output 0 will turn ON the LED of that segment,  logical output 1 will turn OFF the LED of that segment,  For example,    7-segment Display a b c d e f g    0 0 0 0 0 0 0    1 0 0 1 1 1 1    0 0 0 0 1 0 0    Directions:  Complete the truth table in question 1. Derive the Boolean expression for each segment and answer question 2. Implement your design on BASYS 3 Board using Xilinx Vivado with VHDL language.  Take photos of your result and upload them to question 5.

A project requires an investment of $750,000 in new machinery. The machinery will be depreciated over 10 years by the straight-line method and will be worthless at that time. The company can lease the machine with annual payments of $82,500. The payments are due at the beginning of the year. The company's (pre-tax) cost of debt is 5 percent. The corporate tax rate is 21 percent. What is the net advantage of leasing the equipment?
A bond has a $1,000 par value, makes annual interest payments of $100, has 5 years to maturity, cannot be called, and is not expected to default. The bond should sell at a premium if market interest rates are below 10% and at a discount if interest rates are greater than 10%.
Assuming equal annual rates, the more frequent the compounding periods in a year, the higher the future value.

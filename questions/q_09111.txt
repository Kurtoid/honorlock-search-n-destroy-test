This is a free question. There are no wrong answers. I sincerely want to get your feedback so that I can improve the class moving forward. I recognize that this class was carried out under unusual circumstances. For this reason, I structured the class the way I did to facilitate the online learning process (i.e. pre-recorded lectures, online quizzes, and live class sessions for review). What I am wondering is how you would feel about this format even if the class were not online. In other words, under normal circumstances what would be your preferred format for this class. From the following options, please pick the response that best describes your feelings about the class format (A, B, C, or D) and provide your response (and any other comments you have about the class format) in the area below. Again, there are no wrong answers. A) Under normal circumstances, I would prefer a more traditional class structure. For example, meet in-person twice a week during class time. No pre-recorded lectures. All lecture material and examples would be provided in class as part of class time. B) Under normal circumstances, I would prefer a more traditional class structure. For example, meet in-person twice a week during class time. However, I do like the pre-recorded lectures. This way you could focus class time on workout problems and review. C) I like the format with the online lectures for one day and live class for the other day. I recommend you use this even when we get back to normal. D) The format was fine, but I would have benefited from a group tax return project that allowed me to see how all these things worked together. Thank you for a great module!

Modern roller coasters have vertical loops like the one shown in the Figure. The radius of curvature is smaller at the top than on the sides so that the downward centripetal acceleration at the top will be greater than the acceleration due to gravity, keeping the passengers pressed firmly into their seats. What is the speed of the roller coaster (in m/s) at the top of the loop if the radius of curvature there is 14.0 m and the downward acceleration of the car is 13.0 m/s2?

In one fruit species, the gene for a dark color is dominant over its allele for light color. At another gene locus, the gene for short shape is dominant over its allele for long shape. These two allele pairs assort independently. If a plant with long, light fruit is crossed with a plant that is heterozygous for both of these traits, what percentage of the offspring do you expect will be short and dark?

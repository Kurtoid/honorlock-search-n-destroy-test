Choose two of the below correspondence scenarios to address, and keep in mind your purpose, audience, and document design.     Letter  You are the credit manager at Frito-Lay.  Your credit check of the Janak Mercantile Company told you something you didn't detect when you talked personally with CEO Stephanie Janak about her credit application.  In fact, after talking with her, you thought that the credit check would be routine and that the $14,380 order accompanying her request was certain to go through.  But the credit check shows negative information.  Without question, Ms. Janak has extended her credit too far.  For the past year she has been slow to play, and her credit obligations are much too high. So, even though you would like to have the sale, you must refuse.  If you handle this situation delicately, perhaps she will become a good customer in time.  Write the letter.    Memo  Imagine you have been working for a few years in an entry level position in your field of choice. You have done good work and received positive performance reviews, but no raise. Write a memo asking your boss for a raise.    Email  Today, you received this e-mail from your boss:             From: Theresa.Rooker@craftworks.com             To: Marge.Piercy@craftworks.com             Subject:  Oversee United Way I'm appointing you to be the company representative to oversee United Way.  You've done a good job the last two years, so this year should be a piece of cake! It's true that you know exactly what to do.  The job wouldn't be hard for you, but that's just the problem: you wouldn't learn anything, either.  You'd rather have an assignment that would stretch you, teach you new skills, or enable you to interact with new people.  Continuing to grow is your insurance of continued employment and mobility.  Three upcoming projects in your division might offer growth: creating videos for a "town meeting" for all employees to be held at the beginning of next quarter, creating a social media presence for the company, or serving on the diversity committee.  Any of these would be time-consuming, but no more time-consuming than running the United Way campaign. Write to your boss, asking for something more challenging to do.

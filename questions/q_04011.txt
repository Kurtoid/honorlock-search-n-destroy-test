Quealy dialed 911 to report a family dispute with potential for violence. Police officers arrived at the scene and knocked on the door. They heard a loud disturbance inside. Quealy called 911 again to say that the dispute was over and that the officers could leave. The dispatcher informed the officers at the scene about this call, but the officer shouted through the door that they would need to enter the apartment before they could leave. Quealy placed two more calls to 911, again asking the officers to go away. When she finally cracked open the door, the officers pushed it open and came into the apartment. Quealy began screaming and flailing, several feet away from the officers. The officers saw nobody else in the apartment, but decided to detain Quealy long enough to check out the rest of the apartment. When they tried to restrain her, she began to resist, fell to the floor, and began to kick at one of the officers. After a struggle, two officers managed to handcuff her, seat her on a stairway outside the apartment. After securing the handcuffs to the stairway railing, and calling for a backup unit, one of the officers asked her, "Why did you keep calling 911?" She answered, "I should have stopped." Quealy is charged with misuse of 911 and interfering with an officer. Can the government introduce Quealy's statement at trial?

Susan Henry was employed by Acme Distribution, Inc. in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  However, she was unhappy with her position and was looking for a different job.  She interviewed on weekends with other potential employers who had openings.  Finally, on September 1 she received an offer of employment from Cannon Company in Madison, Wisconsin.  The offer, which was included in a letter to Henry from Peter Smith, the Cannon executive who interviewed her, set forth only a summary of the terms and conditions of employment: compensation and job responsibilities; but it did not address many of the other normal terms, for example, starting date and fringe benefits that would be available to Henry.  The offer also provided as follows: "If you are interested in this position, we would like to hear from you in the next month or so."  Henry was very excited about the opportunity with Cannon and immediately gave notice to Acme that she was quitting.  She also entered into a lease for an apartment in Madison and found a sublet to take over her lease in Milwaukee.  Because her salary with Cannon would increase substantially, she also signed a contract to purchase a new car with a delivery date of September 30.  Smith, the Cannon executive, learned through a mutual friend that Henry was intending to accept the Cannon offer of employment and that she was already planning her move to Madison.  Unfortunately, in the meantime, another more qualified applicant interviewed for the job at Cannon.  Smith decided to revoke the offer made to Henry and hire the other person.  He sent to Henry a letter withdrawing the offer of employment included in the September 1 correspondence.  Of course Henry was devastated by the news and believes that Cannon is liable to her under the circumstances.  Which of the following statements is correct?

Items produced by a manufacturing process are supposed to weigh 90 grams. However, there is variability in the items produced, and they do not all weigh exactly 90 grams. The distribution of weights can be approximated by a Normal distribution with a mean of 90 grams and a standard deviation of 1 gram. What percentage of the items will either weigh less than 87 grams or more than 93 grams? Table (Links to an external site.) Or table 2

Base your answers to the following 1 to 7 question(s) on the graph below, depicting an action potential.    The transmission of a nerve impulse along a neuron from one end to the other occurs as a result of electrical changes across the membrane of the neuron. The membrane of an unstimulated neuron is polarized-that is, there is a difference in electrical charge between the outside and inside of the membrane. The inside is negative with respect to the outside. Based on the graph above, after approximately what period of time could another impulse be propagated?

Albert King is a 68-year-old man with a grade 4 glioblastoma. He has a rapid-onset dense left hemiplegia and is being seen by home care nursing, physical therapy, and occupational therapy under the palliative care program. In June, a craniotomy was done to debulk the tumor. After surgery, he discharged himself, against medical recommendations that he stay for inpatient rehabilitation. On his arrival home, an urgent request was sent to home services to clarify his new mobility/transfer status for the home support workers (HSW). The family members were hoping for intensive in-home rehabilitation and in fact expected Mr. King to walk again. Examination revealed grade 1 to 2 strength in scattered leg muscles and a flaccid left arm. Mr. King was unable to sit unsupported. Standing pivot transfers were maximum lift ' 2, so use of the mechanical lift was recommended. These findings were essentially unchanged from Mr. King's preoperative status. Intensive rehabilitation was not feasible, but the therapist agreed to teach the HSW range of motion and facilitation exercises and see him weekly for ongoing reevaluation. Over the succeeding 3 months, Mr. King has been seen eight times, and there has been no motor or sensory recovery. There have been very small functional gains: Mr. King is now able to roll to his weak side in bed using the bedrail. Mr. King has variable wheelchair sitting tolerance (10-60 minutes). Last week, Mrs. King asked about admission to a rehabilitation facility to capitalize on these gains. Given the information provided in the scenario above, would you say that Mr. King is a good candidate for intensive inpatient rehabilitation?  Why or why not?

Suppose we want to implement a random number guessing game.  First, our program should choose a pseudo-random number in the range of 1 to 100 that varies each time we run the program through the use of a unique random number seed.  Second, the player will pick a value.  Third, our program will check the user's guess against the selected random number and tell them if their guess is too high or too low relative to the random number selected by our program.  Fourth, our program will output a congratulations message and the number of tries it took for the user to guess the correct random number. The object of our game is to see how many guesses it takes for the player to guess the right answer. Fill out the correct sequence of the pseudocode statements below that most closely matches the description above in order to design a solution to implement this Random Number guessing game. Pseudocode:  Random Number Guessing Game [1] [2] [3]         [a]         Get another guess [4]

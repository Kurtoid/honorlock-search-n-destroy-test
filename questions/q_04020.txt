Design a Behavior Tree considering the following agent behavior: Link wants an apple from a nearby tree. If he successfully obtains an apple, he will eat it. Link has the following parameterized behaviors: GoTo(location), ClimbUp(object), ClimbDown(object), Take(object), Shake(object), Throw(object), Eat(object) The environment consists of a navigable space and locations including a hill and an outcropping (exposed rock surface), which are somewhat far from each other. Within the environment is an apple tree at the top of the hill, apples (possibly on the tree and/or the ground underneath tree), and small stones at the outcropping. Link can obtain apples utilizing any of the following strategies ordered from lowest to highest action cost: take apple from the ground under the tree, shake the tree, climb the tree and grabbing one, or throw a stone and hitting one to knock it down. However, these actions can fail if there is no apple within arm's reach (with Link either below or perched in the tree), the apples aren't ripe enough to fall when the tree is shaken, the tree is too difficult to climb up (e.g., tree trunk wet from rain), or the thrown stone misses. If Link is not up the tree, he will FAIL to climb down. But if he is up the tree, he can always climb down. Further, note that Link can only eat a food item or throw an object he has taken into possession, can only eat while standing on the ground, and must be near the tree to be within reach of hitting an apple with a thrown stone. Assume Link starts at some random position in the world standing on the ground. Link can only successfully GoTo() a location if he is not perched in a tree. GoTo() will return SUCCESS if Link is already at the location he is attempting to go to. Complete the Behavior Tree such that it captures the above agent strategies for obtaining and eating an apple. Be sure that the behavior tree handles failures at any point such that the next strategy can be attempted. Some nodes are already filled in. Make selections for the following nodes.

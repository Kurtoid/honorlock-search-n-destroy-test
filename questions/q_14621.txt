Assume that an employee may work in up to two departments or may not be assigned to any department. Assume that each department must have one and may have up to three phone numbers. Each phone is used by one, and only one, department. Assume each department can have anywhere between 1 and 30 employees. Each phone is assigned to at least one and maybe assigned to up to 10 employees.  Each employee is assigned at least one, but no more than 2 phones.  Supply (min, max) constraints on this diagram.    Connection Reference  Constraints (min, max) - please fill in the blank    A. ([min1], [max1])   B. ([min2], [max2])   C. ([min3], [max3])   D. ([min4], [max4])   E. ([min5], [max5])   F.

A block is moving up an incline at 3 m/s.  A boy pushes on the block, causing it to speed up to 5 m/s by the time it gets to the top of the incline.  What happens to the kinetic energy and potential energy during this scenario?
An ideal air-filled parallel-plate capacitor has round plates and carries a fixed amount of equal but opposite charge on its plates. All the geometric parameters of the capacitor (plate diameter and plate separation) and the charge are now doubled. If the original capacitance was C0, what is the new capacitance?
Parker reacts negatively to many situations and is slow to accept new experiences. Parker could be classified as a(n) ________ child.
In the beginning of season 4 of "The Walking Dead", a television show on AMC, in addition to dealing with zombies and other dangerous survivors, the heroes face a deadly strain of influenza that kills rapidly.

As covered during our class discussion, offenders may underestimate the likelihood of detection, apprehension, and punishment due to the _______________, which leads people to think their prior run-ins or encounters with the criminal justice system were due to bad luck and that this time will be different.
Considering the below chart, label the three trends of device failure rate based on the following descriptions: PCB - A printed circuit board suffers a brief wear in period followed by an extended period with a relatively constant failure rate as well as some wear out near the end of "life" due to environmental exposure SOFTWARE - A software program does not suffer wear out and use does not substantial contribute to failure rate; however, most failures occur due to "bugs" built-in to the software at the start of life PUMP - A mechanical pump is sold by a manufacturer that conducts burn-in tests at the factory before delivery to customers; however, failure mechanisms for the pump include part fatigue and corrosion (draw the failure rate from the customer's perspective)   Curve "a" = [Curve_a] Curve "b" = [Curve_b] Curve "c" = [Curve_c]
In which specific layer are these cells found?
Absorption is best described as the:
Use the following information for questions 26 through 29 Red Corp. manufactures football jerseys and uses a standard costing system.   The following information pertains to Red's manufacturing overhead costs for 2020.   Both variable and fixed manufacturing overhead are allocated based on machine hours; the denominator for the rate is budgeted machine hours (i.e., standard machine hours required for the budgeted output).   Variable manufacturing overhead costs consist mostly of costs for electricity and indirect materials.    Budgeted number of jerseys 22,000   Standard machine hours per jersey 1.5 hours   Variable manufacturing overhead, static budget $363,000   Fixed manufacturing overhead, static budget $627,000       Actual number of jerseys produced 21,000   Actual machine hours used 33,750 hours   Actual variable manufacturing overhead costs $367,000   Actual fixed manufacturing overhead costs $618,000

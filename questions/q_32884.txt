Turkish-born entrepreneur Hamdi Ulukaya founded his company Chobani in 2005. He launched Chobani Greek Yogurt, which is now the best-selling brand of yogurt in the US. In 2009, Hamdi signed a major deal with leading US grocery wholesaler Costco. Today Chobani has more than 2,200 employees, annual sales of nearly $1bn and sells its products in the US, Australia and the UK. Chobani's newest US factory is the largest yogurt factory in the world. Hamdi states "To buy the yogurt factory, I got a bank loan backed by the US government's Small Business Administration (SBA) I immediately hired a master yogurt maker from Turkey and spent the next two years perfecting our thicker, low sugar recipes with new flavours such as chocolate cherry and caramel pecan. We worked hard to get the packaging right. American yogurt is sold in containers with narrow openings. European yogurt containers are wider and that's what I wanted for Chobani-- to indicate that the product inside was very different. We insisted Chobani was sold in supermarket chains rather than specialty shops and stocked in the dairy aisle, alongside existing yogurt brands. That's probably the single most important decision we made. A rival brand had been selling Greek yogurt in specialty shops since the mid-1990s. But due to limited distribution, it remained a tiny niche market. We wanted Chobani to be accessible to everyone. If we had said yes to early offers from specialty shops, the company never would have grown as quickly as it did. I decided the price per unit we would need to charge to break even, with sales of 20,000 cases a week, by calculating the costs of our packaging, ingredients and labour. It meant if customers liked our product, we would quickly be profitable and could reinvest our profits in growth. A lot of new companies would have launched at a lower price and tried to raise the price later. I avoided that by figuring out an initial price that made long-term sense."

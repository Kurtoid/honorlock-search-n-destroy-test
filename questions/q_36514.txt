A nutrition store in the mall is selling an herbal supplement intended to influence memory. To test the effectiveness (i.e., the influence on memory) of the herbal mixture, a skeptical researcher obtains a sample of n = 49 people and requests that each person take the suggested dosage each day for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4-week period, each individual takes a standardized memory test (large numbers indicate better memory). The scores from the sample produced a mean of M = 33. In the general population, the standardized memory test is known to have a mean of u = 30 and s = 14. Do the sample data support the conclusion that the herbal supplement influenced memory? To answer this question, go through the 7 steps for hypothesis testing and use a = .05 (critical value = +-1.96). SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. 1) IV: [IV] DV: [DV] number of tails: [tails] 2) State Hypotheses: Null: [Null] Alternative: [Alternative] 3) Describe where the critical region(s) would be on a distribution.

Q5 Two points on the P-M interaction diagram have been selected.   P1 and M1 are the axial load and moment for point 1, and the depth of neutral axis at this point c1 = 3/4cb (cb is the depth of neutral axis at the balanced point). P2 and M2 are the axial load and moment for point 2, and the depth of neutral axis at this point c2 = 1/2cb (cb is the depth of neutral axis at the balanced point).

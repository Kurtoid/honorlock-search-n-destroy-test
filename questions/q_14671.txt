8. Consider a walkup service center that is modeled by an M/M/1 queuing system (Poisson arrivals and exponential service times), where the average service time is 85 seconds. Customer inter-arrival times are currently on the increase, and management will add a second server once average waiting time in the queue reaches 8 minutes. What is the average inter-arrival time (in seconds, to two decimal places to the right of the decimal point) that will result in an average waiting time in the queue of 8 minutes for this M/M/1 system, thereby creating the need for a second server? Show all work.

(Chapter 21) Ambinu Flower Company provides flowers and other nursery products for decorative purposes in medium to large sized restaurants and businesses. The company has been investigating the purchase of a new specially equipped van for deliveries. The van has an economic lifetime of six years. At the end of its life the residual value is expected to be $10,000. The expected additional cash inflows resulting from the purchase are estimated to be $52,500 per year. Determine the purchase price of the van, given that the estimated payback period is 2.5 years

Consider the drawing of a steel plate above. (note: point D is directly above the line EA) The constant-thickness, homogenous plate weighs 250 pounds and the distance L = 11  inches. The plate is held in static equilibrium by the cable CD and by ball-and-socket supports at A and B. To make the problem appropriate for EGM 2511, treat the ball-and-socket joint at A as modified so that it will not generate a reaction force in the y direction (Ay=0). The acceleration due to gravity points in the direction along the negative z-axis as drawn. Choose the best six (6) answers below for the following questions: 1. What is the tension in cable CD? 2. What is the magnitude of FAx? 3. What is the magnitude of FAz? 4. What is the magnitude of FBx? 5. What is the magnitude of FBy? 6. What is the magnitude of FBz? IMPORTANT NOTE: A negative answer means that the force direction is opposite the customary assumption that the Cartesian orthonormal basis vectors i, j, and k are aligned with the positive x, y, and z axes as drawn.

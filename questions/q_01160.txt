You are only allowed pencils, one 8.5x11" piece of blank scratch paper (both sides), and a small non-programmable  hand-held calculator on your desk for this exam. No other computers or cell phones are allowed. This will be confirmed by the Honorlock room scan from your computer camera. Points may be deducted for an inadequate room scans including inadequate lighting which diminishes the room-scan quality.   Please type the following confirmation in the text box below: " In submitting this exam, I am verifying that it was completed by me using only my knowledge of the material at the time I took the exam. I herby affirm that I have followed the PLNU Academic Honesty Statement for this course. "

BMED 2110 - Final Exam (quiz 10) Recent research concerned with fuels used for jets and airplanes has shown that the addition of natural products leads to an increase in the stored energy associated with these fuels. A candidate for this application has been isolated form pine wood. It is a molecule with the structure C10H16 . In order to determine the enthalpy of formation of this unknown molecule it is injected with a rate of 1.36 g/min into a reactor. A second inlet stream is air, which enters the reactor at a flow rate of    32.8 l/min and a temperature of 127 C.  The molecule reacts with the oxygen in the air to form CO2 and H2O, the degree of conversion of the molecule is 100% and the reactor loses  133W  as heat to the environment. The temperature of the product stream is 1.75*103 K. Calculate the specific molar enthalpy of formation of the unknown molecule for its reference state at standard pressure and temperature.    You might need the following data for your analysis: Properties of the unknown substance: chemical structure: C10H16 density: 0.858 g/ml  melting point: -63C  boiling point: 156.85 C   Enthalpies of formation: Water(liq): -285.83 kJ/mol Water (gas): -241.82 kJ/mol CO2 (gas): -393.51 kJ/mol   Hints: For your calculation you must correctly fill out the NH-table, which is provided below (a copy of this table was sent out prior to the quiz, if you do not have it at hand you may draw your own table). A degree of freedom analysis is not required, however you might use it to your advantage.

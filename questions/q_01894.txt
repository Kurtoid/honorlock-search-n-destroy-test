A small study on the effectiveness of a math prep course was conducted. In the study, three participants were given a test prior to the course and another test after the course. The following table shows the test scores for each participant. Assume that test scores are normally distributed. Before:               72          83          91          78 After:                  76          86          95          76   a. Calculate a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the population mean difference in the test scores before and after the math prep course. Lower bound = [LB] Upper bound = [UB] b. Is it plausible that completing the math prep course did not improve the average test score? Explain your answer. Yes or No [conclusion] Explain [explain]

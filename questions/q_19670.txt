Initially unpolarized light with intensity I0 is sent along the z-axis into a system of three polarizing sheets placed perpendicular to the z-axis and whose polarizing angles with respect to y-axis are 90* (first sheet on the path of light), 30* (second sheet on the path of light), and 45* (the last sheet). The middle polarizer is removed. What is the change in the intensity of the transmitted light, that is, I2 polarizers - I3 polarizers, in terms of the initial intensity, I0?

Explain the difference between the surface area of a water tower and the volume of a water tower in a way that could help someone learn the difference. Determine the total surface area as well as the volume of a box that is 3 feet wide, 2 feet deep, and 4 feet tall. Explain why you calculate as you do. Include drawings of the 3D model of the box and the box's flat/net pattern (what would the box look like unfolded).

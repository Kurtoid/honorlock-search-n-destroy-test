Consider each situation separately.  (For example, an answer may look like 0, 1, 3, 5, 7.)  Also, consider a line to have executed as long as it begins.  You must get all the lines in correct order to receive credit. A. There is an IOException thrown in the call to calculate at statement 2. [A]B. There is an NullPointerException thrown in the call to iterate at statement 4. [B]C. There is an unchecked Exception thrown in the call to prep in statement 1. [C] D. There are no exceptions thrown by any statement. [D]
You are heavily in debt as a result of betting large sums of money on Greyhound (Dog) Races in Naples, Florida.  A friend of yours reveals that she learned to classify muscle fiber types when she participated in a BIMS 489 research project at TAMU.  She owes you a huge favor, so you ask her to histologically examine biopsies of the hamstring muscles that have been secretly obtained from 5 dogs entered into next week's high stakes race.  She reluctantly agrees and gives you the following report comparing the skeletal muscle cells and vascularization of these muscles:                                 Dog 1 - most extensive capillary network                                Dog 2 - highest concentration of mitochondria                                Dog 3 - largest fiber diameter                                Dog 4 - greatest concentration of myoglobin                                 Dog 5 - highest ratio of low myosin ATPase to high myosin ATPase                 Being a betting person and desperate to get out of debt, you quickly violate all ethical and legal standards and bet on the race.  Recognizing that the upcoming sprint is for an extremely short distance, you should place your bet on:

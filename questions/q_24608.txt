GELO #6 - Question 10 Niko Tinbergen (1907 - 1988) was a Swedish Ethologist (animal behaviorist) famous for studying animals in their native habitats. One of his classic experiments involved a bird called the black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus). Black-headed gulls build nests of twigs on the ground and lay light brown eggs that are covered with dark brown spots. However, the inside of the egg is white in color. Tinbergen noticed that adult gulls pick up the eggshells shortly after a chick has hatched, and fly them to a location far from the nest, where they are left. Since this behavior required expending energy and time that could have been spent feeding and protecting the chicks, Tinbergen wanted to know why the birds did this.     Experiment:  Tinbergen and his co-workers collected gull eggs and painted 69 of them white and left 68 of them with their natural color. (Statistically, these numbers are close enough to be considered equal.) The researchers then scattered the eggs next to a gull breeding area and observed from a nearby blind. Predation rates were recorded for white versus natural colored eggs.       Do the results of Tinbergen's study support the hypothesis?

Los garifunas Lee el texto sobre los garifunas y determina si las oraciones son ciertas o falsas. En 1635, un barco de esclavos venia hacia el Nuevo Mundo cuando naufrago (shipwrecked) cerca de la isla de San Vicente en el mar Caribe. Los sobrevivientes llegaron hasta una isla donde vivieron con los indigenas caribe (Caribs) y formaron una nueva comunidad en libertad. Asi nacieron "los negros caribe" (Black Caribs), tambien conocidos como "los garifunas".  Despues de una guerra (war), tanto Inglaterra (England) como Francia reclamaban la isla de San Vicente como suya. En 1783, Inglaterra y Francia firmaron el Tratado (Treaty) de Paris bajo el cual San Vicente paso a manos inglesas. En marzo de 1797, los ingleses deportaron a 5.080 garifunas y el 12 de abril de 1797 llegaron a la isla de Roatan, hoy en dia parte de Honduras. Al tiempo, los garifunas empezaron a extenderse por la costa caribena de America Central. Hoy en dia, hay comunidades garifunas en Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala y Belice. Mantienen muchos elementos de sus raices (roots) africanas, como la musica y el baile. La comunidad garifuna mas grande fuera de America Central se encuentra en Nueva York, donde se estima que viven unos 200.000 garifunas.   [1] La cultura garifuna fue formada por africanos e indigenas caribes.   [2] El Tratado de Paris fue firmado en 1783.   [3]Los garifunas fueron deportados de San Vicente por los franceses.   [4] Los garifunas fueron esclavizados (enslaved) en Honduras.   [5] Hay mas garifunas en Nueva York que en America Central.

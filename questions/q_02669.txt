Problem  No. 1  A double angle shape, 2L6x4x5/16 is connected by a  3/4 -in gusset plate with LLBB as shown below.  The total tensile service load (unfactored load)  applied is it is 25% dead load and 75% live load.  The bolts are 7/8-in-diameter, A325 bearing-type.  The angle material is A572 Grade 50 steel, and the gusset is A36 steel. Hint: Check all possible failure possibilities, including block shear. Gage spacing (bolt raw spacing) see Manual p1-52 (Table 1-7A). Based on this answer the following question: Question 1.6: For the spacing of rows of bolts as per Table 1-7A in the Steel Manual what i g1 ? [Enter value in inches]

A city's Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) operates a subway line for commuters from a certain suburb to the downtown metropolitan area. Currently, an average of 6,000 passengers a day take the trains, paying a fare of $3 per ride. They estimate that, for each $0.50 increase in fare, the ridership will be reduced by an average of 500 passengers a day. (a)If x represents the number of price increases, write two expressions - one that represents the average number of daily passengers and the second that represents the price per ticket. (b) Using the expressions found in step a and optimization techniques, find the price that the MTA should charge to maximize revenue. (c) What is the average number of daily passengers when revenue is maximized?

Lawyer represented Landlord who owns several commercial and residential buildings. Landlord was anxious to renovate one of the small residential buildings with only four apartments to capitalize on the changing neighborhood. The leases in three of the apartments end in the next three months.  The lease, however, in the fourth apartment does not end for 11 months. Landlord told Lawyer that the tenant in the fourth apartment is selling drugs from her apartment and that he wants to evict her. Lawyer does not know about Landlord's plans for the building.  Tenant, who was unrepresented, was evicted based on the testimony of Landlord's witness who testified that he witnessed Tenant dealing drugs.  Neither side appeals.   About six months after Tenant was evicted, Landlord's witness contacts Lawyer and tells Lawyer that he was paid by Landlord to testify.  While the witness saw a number of people coming and going from Tenant's apartment, he did not see Tenant selling drugs.  When Lawyer asks Landlord if he paid the witness to testify falsely, Landlord responds, "Witness is a drug addict and needed money. I helped him out and he helped me out by saying what I needed him to say.  I'm glad you called. I have some contracts that I need you to review immediately."   Must the Lawyer reveal to the trial judge what both the witness and Landlord said?

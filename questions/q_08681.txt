The internet is poor at putting information in context. Kids who look up the quadratic equation may end up like the child who looked up "meticulous"; they have a definition, but they don't have the background knowledge to use it correctly. Students should learn not only the formula but also why it works and how it connects to other math content. That's how contextual knowledge develops in the brain, and that's why vocabulary instruction seldom consists of simple memorization of definitions -- students are asked to use the words in a variety of sentences. The same should be true of more advanced concepts and for the same reason.   Explain how contextual knowledge is developed in the brain.

Hester reveals the name of Pearl's father
On January 1, 2021, Patricia, a citizen of Florida, filed a complaint in the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida against Devin, a citizen of Alabama, alleging that Devin committed fraud by failing to disclose, in the sale of a 42 foot trawler, that the boat had suffered previous hull damage. Patricia seeks $100,000 compensatory damages and $250,000 punitive damages. On February 1, 2021, Devin filed a timely motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, arguing that Patricia's complaint does not comply with the "particularity" requirement of Rule 9. In response, on April 1, 2021, before the district court had ruled on the 12(b)(6) motion, Patricia filed a motion requesting the court's leave to amend her complaint to add factual details, fully explaining the nature, timing and circumstances of the fraud, specifying that Devin had failed to disclose that the bow, starboard side of the hull had been patched after being damaged due to crashing against coral rocks during Hurricane Irma. Devin objects to the amendment as untimely. Should the amendment be allowed?

GROUP D:  A slide discussed in one of the video lectures identified ten different "ethical tests" which are rules of thumb (heuristics) that can be used as simple guidelines for ethical decision making.  (A) Identify AND explain five of these (5).  (B) For each of these five ethical tests state how good a guideline for making ethical decisions it is AND logically support your answer (5).

In class we discussed an experimental design that looked at the role of H-2 in T cell help for antibody production by B cells.  Similar experiments were done looking at the role of H-2 in CTL function.  In this experiment, we'll look at T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against cells infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV).  CTLs were generated by infecting various strains of mice with LCMV, and then isolating splenic lymphocytes as CTL effector cells.  All target cells were monolayers of C3H mouse fibroblasts that were either infected or not infected with LCMV, and labelled with 51Cr.  To perform the assay, target cells were overlaid with CTL effector cells and cultured for 16 hours, after which supernatants were collected to determine the % release of 51Cr.

Fatigue crack growth rate is normally described by Paris Equation, .  The fatigue crack growth test is conducted at smax = 400 MPa and smin = 100 MPa. Assuming the C=7.2x10-12 and m=4 for stress in the unit of "MPa" and crack length in the unit of "m", Please determine a) (7 pts) The crack growth rate of a 1 mm deep surface crack; b) (8 pts) How many cycles it needs to grow a surface crack from 1 mm to 2 mm.  (For your K calculation, use:   )

That is, they would like to test the following claim:  Based on a very large random sample of patients taking the new medication, the sample proportion who became nauseated was 1.7 standard deviations below 0.25. Using a significance level of 0.05. Select all that are true

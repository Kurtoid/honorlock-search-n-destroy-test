Forecast demands over the next six months for a particular laptop are 1,280, 640, 900, 1,200, 2,000, and 1,400. Ending inventory in December is expected to be 500 units, and the firm would like to have 600 units on hand at the end of June. No shortage is allowed. There are currently (end of December) 300 workers employed in the plant. One worker produced an average of 0.14653 laptop in one day. That is K factor, K= 0.14653. We assume this to be 20, 24, 18, 26, 22, and 15 for January to June, respectively. There are only three costs to be considered: cost of hiring workers, cost of firing workers, and cost of holding inventory. Define  cH = Cost of hiring one worker = $500, cF = Cost of firing one worker = $1,000, cI  = Cost of holding one unit of inventory for one month = $80.

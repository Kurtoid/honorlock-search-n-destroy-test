Human blood serum contains a class of enzymes known as acid phosphatases, which hydrolyze biological phosphate esters under slightly acidic conditions (pH 5.0).  Acid phosphatases are produced by erythrocytes and by the liver, kidney, spleen and prostate gland.  The enzyme of the prostate gland is clinically important, because its increased activity in the blood can be an indication of prostate cancer.  The phosphatase from the prostate gland is strongly inhibited by tartrate ion, but acid phosphatases from other tissues are not.  This information can be used to develop a procedure for determining the activity of the acid phosphatase from the prostate gland in human blood serum, even in the presence of acid phosphatases from other tissues.  Choose the correct statement from those shown below that describes how this determination would be carried out.

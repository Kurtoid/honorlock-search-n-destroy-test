I took a random subsample of 11 HBSAC respondents, and their heights (in inches) were 56, 67, 62, 59, 64, 53, 69, 64, 54, 68, and 66. If the sample standard deviation of these data equals 32.4, then the sample variance equals 5.69.
Consider eight graphs shown in the figure above. Which two of the following graphs can represent acceleration of an object in a simple harmonic motion as a function of time? Check all that apply.

Review each case and indicate the correct CPT code.    Preoperative diagnosis: Warts Postoperative diagnosis: One wart on third toe of right foot and two warts on fourth toe of left foot Due to the size of the warts, the patient was taken to the operating room for wart removal. The left foot was infiltrated with 1% Lidocaine. The CO2 laser was prepared, and the wart on the right third toe was vaporized. The two larger warts on the fourth toe of the left foot were then vaporized. All areas were vaporized to a depth of 1.5 cm. A 3-mm margin was vaporized around all the lesions. Noting no complications, the patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

In class we covered a reaction called the "pinacol rearrangement" which dehydrates 1,2-diols to yield aldehydes/ketones via carbocation intermediates. An example of a pinacol rearrangement is shown below.  The following deamination (elimination of NH3) of a b-aminoalcohol proceeds through a mechanism similar to that of a pinacol rearrangement. Note the curved arrow indicating that nitrogen gas (:N[?]N:, N2) will depart as a leaving group in the next mechanistic step.  Which of the following species (A-D) is a mechanistic intermediate in this deamination reaction? [intermediate]  Which of the following molecules (E-H) would be the expected major product of this deamination reaction? [product]  Two (2) of the following b-aminoalcohols (I-L) could give the same product as the pinacol rearrangement shown at the very top of this page (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) in the deamination reaction. Answer the following questions about these b-aminoalcohols. Note that ring contraction rearrangements may occur to reduce ring strain. Could b-aminoalcohol K give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon treatment with NaNO2 / HCl? [betaK] Could b-aminoalcohol L give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon treatment with NaNO2 / HCl? [betaL]

Hamilton Real Estate exchanged one piece of commercial property for another piece of commercial property.  The originally owned property originally cost $300,000, and had accumulated depreciation of $80,000, and had a fair value of $400,000.  Hamilton paid $50,000 cash to complete the exchange. Assuming that the exchange has commercial substance, Hamilton would record a gain/(loss) of:

Group of proteins that are activated with heat-stress, as they stabilize the formation of other proteins and their appropriate folding:
When 50.0 mL of 0.400 M Ca(NO3)2 is added to 50.0 mL of 0.800 M NaF, CaF2 precipitates, as shown in the net ionic equation below. The initial temperature of both solutions is 22.00degC. Assuming that the reaction goes to completion, and that the resulting solution has a mass of 100.00 g and a specific heat of 4.18 J/(g [?] degC), calculate the final temperature of the solution.    Ca2+(aq) + 2 F-(aq) - CaF2(s) DHdeg = -11.5 kJ

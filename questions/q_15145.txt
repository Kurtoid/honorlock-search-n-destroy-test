Two kids, A and B, are on a balanced seesaw with the pivot point located at the center of the seesaw as shown below. Mass of A = 30 kg and mass of B = 40 kg. Seesaw has a mass of 25 kg.  A)  Kid A sits 1.5 m from the pivot point of the balanced seesaw. Calculate the torque provided by A.  (5 points) B) Calculate the distance from the pivot point to B when the seesaw is balanced and A sits 1.5 m from the pivot point. (5 points) C) Calculate the normal force (support force) provided by the pivot point on the seesaw. (5 points) D) Now A moves closer to the pivot point so that the distance from A to pivot point is 1 m, and B remains at the same position.  What is the net torque on the seesaw?  Clearly state whether the net torque is clockwise or counterclockwise. (4 points for magnitude, 1 point for direction) E) As A sits 1 m from the fulcrum, B decides to move to balance the seesaw. Calculate the new distance from B to pivot point that keeps the seesaw balanced. (5 points)

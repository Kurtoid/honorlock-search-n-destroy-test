Don White is a 50 year old admitted to the hospital for influenza infection secondary to hypoxia. He has required 1-2 L NC during his hospital stay. One evening, you are called to bedside to assess Mr. White. He appears lethargic on assessment but able to answer simple questions with stimulation. You also note that the nurse has increased his NC to 5 L to maintain a saturation of 92% on the monitor. You obtain an abg the results are pH 7.33, CO2 60, PaO2 80, HcO3 25.

You observe that your newly generated kinase inhibitor completely inhibits kinase activity at high concentrations, but actually stimulates kinase activity at low concentrations. How might this be explained if you know that the kinase is dimeric, and is subject to allosteric regulation? (4 points)    2. Name and explain the important features of the two most commonly used models of allosteric regulation? (3 pts)     3. List three advantages that allosteric modulators might have over orthosteric drugs (at least in particular situations). (3 points)

Question 8: Epigenetic Gene Regulation as a Drug Target (Dr. D. Liao)    Azacitibine and decitabine are two cytidine analogs that inhibit DNMTs. Describe briefly how these drugs may inhibit cancer cell growth. (5 points)    The chemical structures of the two compounds are provided below.          2. Zinc is required for the deacetylation reaction catalyzed by some histone deacetylases (HDACs). The structures of the HDAC inhibitor SAHA (panel A in the figure shown below) and CMP1 (panel B) in complex with an HDAC enzyme have been determined. The catalytic zinc ion in the catalytic center is shown as a sphere in cyan. Based on the structure of HDAC-inhibitor complexes, describe briefly the mechanism of drug action of HDAC inhibitors.

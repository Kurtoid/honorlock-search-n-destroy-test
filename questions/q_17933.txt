Below you are given the possible options for the displacement of an object. I will tell you that there is a force vector acting in a particular direction, and ask you which displacement vector(s) will give you a certain aspect of the work. Assume all displacement vectors have the same length/magnitude. The angle between all neighboring vectors is 45 degrees.  Part (a): The force is parallel to vector a-{"version":"1.1","math":"a-"}. Which displacement vectors give you the maximum magnitude of work? Part (b): The force is perpendicular to vector f-{"version":"1.1","math":"f-"} (but still in the plane of the provided options). Which displacement vectors give you the minimum magnitude of work? Part (c): The force is parallel to vector d-{"version":"1.1","math":"d-"}. Which displacement vectors would give a negative amount of work? Part (d): The force is parallel to vector b-{"version":"1.1","math":"b-"}. Which displacement vectors would give a positive amount of work?

In a hair salon, there are 2 hairdressers and there is no waiting space. Customer arrivals follow a Poisson process of rate 2 per hour. The service time follows exponential distributions with mean 15 minutes. The 2 hairdressers are equally skilled.  Below is the rate transition diagram where each state is defined as the number of customers in the salon.    In the rate diagram, the value of transition rates are  A = [a] per hour; B = [b] per hour; C = [c] per hour; and  D = [d] per hour.

This Problem Counts 4 Points Charley & Waldo's World of Wonder is a science-oriented children's museum. The museum has a "free" section where children have unlimited use science oriented exhibits and a premium section where children (or their parents) pay on a per exhibit basis. For example one of the premium exhibits is a narrated demonstration of "Tesla Balls". Revenue earned on premium exhibits is tracked separately for each exhibit. Charley and Waldo are considering expanding their premium area and are looking at adding a new exhibit. They plan to only add one new exhibit. After viewing a number of ideas suggested by high school science teachers and children psychologists, they have narrowed the list down to two alternatives. The investment required and the anticipated free cash flow for each alternative is shown in the table below. Zip is a demonstration of friction and air resistance; and Catch Air is an inverted wind tunnel that allows children to float in air as if they are flying. If Charley and Waldo believe that the NPV technique is the best in terms of selecting capital projects, which project should they pick. In answering this question assume that the cost of capital is 6.5%. The Zip attraction will have a useful life of 6 years with zero salvage value, Catch Air would have a useful life of 3 years with zero salvage value.

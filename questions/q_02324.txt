11.  All airplane passengers at the Lake City Regional airport must pass through security screening before proceeding to the boarding area. The airport has 5 screening stations available, and the facility manager must decide how many to have open at any particular time. The hourly cost of opening each station is $20. The average service time for processing passengers at each screening station is 20 seconds per passenger. On Monday morning, the arrival rate is 0.095 passengers per second. Assume exponential service times and Poisson arrival rates. The hourly cost of customer time spent in the system is $50 per hour. Compute the Monday morning hourly cost for 2, 3, 4, and 5 screening stations and pick the best option. Show all work.

Use the figure to answer the following question.The figure proposes a combination of a top-down and bottom-up model (a hypothesis) to describe the variable effects of biological control herbivores on the fitness of an invasive plant, spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe). Researchers transported and released several insect species from the plant's native range in Europe in an attempt to reduce densities of this non-native weed in the United States. The y-axis shows C. stoebe plant fitness, and the x-axis represents the intensity of herbivory by the insects, from low to high. As the vertical shaded bar is moved along the x-axis, the ultimate effect of herbivory (now A, B, and C) on plant fitness can change based on its intensity and the other factors. The horizontal dashed line represents no predicted change in fitness under the effects of varying intensity of herbivory, plant competition, and soil resources available to the plant (such as nitrogen or water), while the three solid lines represent other possible outcomes.(D.G. Knochel and T.R. Seastedt. 2011. Reconciling contradictory findings of herbivore impacts on spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) growth and reproduction. Ecological Applications 20(7):1903-1912.)What is the model's prediction for C. stoebe plant fitness when growing under high soil resource conditions?

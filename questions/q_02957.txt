Refer to the following information to answer the question.   Assume that an incompletely dominant gene controls the feather color in chickens so that BB produces black, BW produces a slate-gray color called blue, and WW produces a splashed-white.  A second gene on a separate chromosome controls comb shape, with the dominant gene R producing a rose comb and the recessive genes rr producing a single comb.   If a pure breeding black, rose-comb chicken is mated with a white, single-comb chicken, what proportion of the offspring will be white, single-comb chickens?

Please use the following information to answer the question(s) below.The Brazil nut tree, Bertholletia excels (n = 17), is native to tropical rain forests of South America. It is a hardwood tree that can grow to over 50 meters tall, is a source of high-quality lumber, and is a favorite nesting site for harpy eagles. As the rainy season ends, tough-walled fruits, each containing 8-25 seeds (Brazil nuts), fall to the forest floor. Brazil nuts are composed primarily of endosperm. About $50 million worth of nuts are harvested each year. Scientists have discovered that the pale yellow flowers of Brazil nut trees cannot fertilize themselves and admit only female orchid bees as pollinators. The agouti (Dasyprocta spp.), a cat-sized rodent, is the only animal with teeth strong enough to crack the hard wall of Brazil nut fruits. It typically eats some of the seeds, buries others, and leaves still others inside the fruit, which moisture can then enter. The uneaten seeds may subsequently germinate.The same bees that pollinate the flowers of the Brazil nut trees pollinate orchids, which are epiphytes (plants that grow on other plants); however, orchids cannot grow on Brazil nut trees. These observations explain

You can safely assume that following interrupt service routine runs on a single CPU system for this question. void network_packet() {   ...   while ((xchg(&packet->locked, 1)) != 0)          ;   // get the packet   // insert to the message packet list   m = getpacket();   insertpacket(m);   packet->locked = 0;} Answer the following two questions.   Why the above interrupt service routine network_packet() could be the source of deadlock?

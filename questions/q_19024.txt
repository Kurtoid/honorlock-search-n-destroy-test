Problem 1 (15 points) Pollution control equipment for a pulverized coal cyclone furnace is expected to cost $190,000 two years from now and another $120,000 four years from now.  If Monongahela Power wants to set aside enough money now to cover these costs, how much must be invested at an interest rate of 10% per year compounded quarterly?                      Problem 2 (20 points) There is no interperiod compounding for the transactions shown. Consider the deposits and withdrawals as your company's deposits/withdrawals. Your manager asks you to determine the amount of money in the account at the end of year 3 at an interest rate of 12% per year compounded semiannually (hint: CP=semiannually).     Determine the effective interest rate per semiannually. Draw the cash flow diagram according to the cash flows listed in the table. Draw the cash flow diagram when PP=CP. Determine the amount of money at the end of year 3.    Problem 3 (15 points) An environmental engineer must recommend one of two methods for monitoring high colony counts of E.coli and other bacteria in watershed area "hot spots". Estimates are shown in the table and the MARR is 6% per year.     For a study period of 3 years, use PW analysis to select the better method. Use present worth (PW) analysis to select the better method (use LCM).    Problem 4 (20 points) An environmental engineer is considering three methods to disposing of an non-hazardous chemical sludge: land application, fluidized-bed incineration, and private disposal contract. The estimates for each method are listed in the table below. The MARR is 10% per year.       Calculate the capital recovery of Land Application method. Use annual worth (AW) analysis for comparing the three methods. Determine which method has the least cost on the basis of an annual worth comparison. Determine the equivalent present worth value of each method using its AW value.    Problem 5 (15 points) There are four independent projects. The project costs and the PW values at MARR = 12% per year are available in the table below.     What projects are acceptable if the budget is no limit? Justify your answer. What projects are acceptable if the budget is $50,000? Justify your answer.

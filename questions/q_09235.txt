This composer wrote the modern Opera Wozzeck.
You are a researcher in public health microbiology lab trying to figure out how a strain of Staphylococcus aureaus you call "Resisto-Staph" acquired resistance to the antibiotic Ceflacor, which normally kills S. aureaus. In order to understand more about Resisto-Staph's mechanism for resisting Ceflacor, you create a media with a known amount of Ceflacor in it, and then add Resisto-Staph. Every hour, you measure the concentration of the Ceflacor in the media (extracellular solution) and in the Resisto-Staph (intracellular solution) to determine what has happened to the antibiotic. The overall amount of Ceflacor will not change (meaning that the extracellular and intracellular concentrations should together add up to 100%) unless Ceflacor is degraded. Examine the graph and chart below of your results. What mechanism of resistance do you suspect Resisto-Staph has evolved or acquired in order to resist Cefalcor?

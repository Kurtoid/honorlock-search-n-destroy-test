In class we discussed an experiment where researchers compared germ free mice colonized with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt)  to germ free mice colonized with Bt and Methanobrevibacter smithii (Ms).  The figure below shows transcriptomics data from this experiment, where red indicates the gene was upregulated in mice with Bt/Ms and green indicates that the gene was down regulated in mice with Bt/Ms.     Where are organisms expressing fructofuranosidases and fructokinases likely located in the gastrointestinal tract?  Explain your answer.  Why would the upregulation of these enzymes result in weight gain for the mice?

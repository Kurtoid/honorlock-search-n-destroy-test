The assignment is due the next day. Your friend says he already is on academic probation and if he fails the assignment he will fail the class and not be able to return to Longwood next semester.

Write a 5-paragraph essay in which you (1) identify the stakeholders in this situation, (2) apply the 8 Key Questions Moral Framework to reason through the potential responses you could make, and (3) explain how you would respond and why, being sure to tie your decision to the 8 key question reasoning process.   Your answer must begin with a paragraph that introduces the issue, you must devote a paragraph to each of the above three parts of the essay in the body, and the answer must end with a concluding paragraph.  The reader must be able to see the divisions between paragraphs with indentation or space between them.

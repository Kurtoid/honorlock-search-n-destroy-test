You inoculate 3 starch plates: Plate 1: Control with no organism inoculated Plate 2: Spot inoculated with Organism A which is known to hydrolyze starch Plate 3: Spot inoculated with Organism B which is also known to hydrolyze starch You incubate for 48 hours at 37degC. When you check your plates, you see similar levels of growth on both of the inoculated plates and no growth on the control plate, as you expected. You then add iodine to all of the plates as required. Following iodine addition, you notice that your control plate stains with the iodine as expected and that Plate 2 has a zone of non-staining surrounding the bacterial growth while the rest of the plate did stain. However, strangely your Plate 3 does not darken anywhere even though it was also stained with iodine. How can this unexpected result be explained (you can assume that all media was prepared properly and there were no mistakes made in inoculation or incubation).

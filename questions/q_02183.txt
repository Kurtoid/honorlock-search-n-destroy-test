An AC voltage source is connected to a "black box" which contains a circuit.      The elements in the circuit and their arrangement are unknown. Measurements of the circuit provide the following information:    V ( t )  =  (80 V) sin ( o t)    I ( t )  =  (1.6 A) sin ( o t + 45 deg )          1. Does the current lead or lag the voltage? 2. Is the circuit in the black box largely capacitive or inductive? 3. Is the circuit in the black box at resonance? Explain why or why not.    4. Compute the average power delivered to the black box by the AC source.

This is Question D. Please write your solution complete with your full name and Question D at the top. When you have submitted the auto-graded portion of the exam, upload your solution to the Question D assignment in the Exam 2 module within 15 minutes.  Consider the algorithm below, which computes the maximum element of an array A. max(A,n), where n [?] N+ and A = [a0...an-1] is an integer array (1) i - 0 (2) m - a0 (3) while i < n-1 do (4)     if m < ai+1 then m - ai+1 (5)     i - i+1 (6) end (7) return m {output is the maximum value of the array A} (a) (5 points.) Prove that m = max(a0...ai) is a loop invariant. (b) (3 points.) Use the loop invariant m = max(a0...ai) and the loop invariant i <= n-1 to show that max is partially correct. (Note that you do not need to prove that i <= n-1 is a loop invariant.) (c) (2 points.) Find the number of times the if condition in line (4) is tested for an array of length n.

Fill in the blank with the most appropriate answer.  Your answer could be a word or a sentence. a) In a hypothesis test, a larger test statistic leads to a [teststat] p-value. b) True or false: Larger p-values provide evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

An insurance company knows that in the entire population of millions of homeowners, the mean annual loss from fire is $500, and the standard deviation of the loss is $3000. The distribution of losses is strongly right-skewed: most policies have $0 loss, but a few have large losses. If the company sells 10,000 policies, what is the probability that it can safely base its rates on the assumption that its average loss will be no greater than $505? Select the best option in each case:  With the concepts you have learned in the course, is it possible to compute this probability applying [color6]   To compute the z-score you will use an observed mean of [color1], a population mean (mean of the box) of [color2], a standard error of [color3]. The z-score is [color]. The probability (rounded to the nearest hundredth)  that the insurance company can safely base its rates on the assumption that its average loss will be no greater than $505 is  [color5]

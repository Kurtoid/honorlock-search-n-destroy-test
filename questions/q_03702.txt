Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr A sample of gas collected at 21.0degC and 0.868 atm, has a volume of 1.83 liters.  What volume will the gas occupy if the temperature is increased to 38.0degC and the pressure is reduced to 0.658 atm?  To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem.  Be sure to include the answer. Show your work (equation/and units) by using the equation editor () in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use     to insert ratios. Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

An aerated lagoon is to be designed for a community with 0.55 MGD of raw wastewater flow rate. The following information is available.  BOD5 applied to the aerated lagoons: 131 mg/L Oxygen requirement: 1.75 lb O2/lb BOD5 applied to the lagoon The mechanical aerators furnish 1.6 lb O2/hp-hr. Design width: 103 ft Design length: 335 ft Design depth: 12 ft     (5 pts) Determine organic mass loading to the aerated lagoons (unit: lb BOD5/day). (5 pts) If mixing power intensity (MPI) was 0.066 hp/1,000 ft3, but the minimum requirement of MPI for design is 0.15 hp/1,000 ft3, determine power requirements per aerated lagoon (unit: hp). (Hint: power requirements per aerated lagoon = MPI x aerated lagoon volume)

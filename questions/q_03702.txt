Is the bolded statement TRUE or FALSE? Changes in bond enthalpy are calculated by taking the difference between the enthalpy of the bonds broken and the enthalpy of the bonds formed (dH = Hbonds broken - Hbonds formed).  Given this changes in bond enthalpy:  16. are always negative for a reaction in which more bonds are formed than broken. 17. when positive, indicate the formation of bonds. 18. when negative, will destabilize a system (such as a protein), and are therefore considered thermodynamically unfavorable. 19. are always positive for an endergonic process. 20. would be negative if hydrogen bonds were being broken in order to form covalent bonds.

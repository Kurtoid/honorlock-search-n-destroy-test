Marc has chosen to use LIFO for tax purposes. Therefore, Marc must use the LIFO inventory method for external reporting. However, Marc maintains its internal records using FIFO. At the end of 2016, Marc's internal system reported ending inventory of $100,000 and a LIFO reserve of $12,000 resulting in an inventory balance of $88,000 on Marc's externally reported balance sheet. During 2017, Marc reported COGS of $950,000 on its externally reported income statement. At the end of 2017, Marc's internal accounting system reported ending inventory of $120,000, and that its LIFO reserve increased to $15,000. What would Marc have reported for COGS, if Marc used FIFO instead of LIFO for external reporting purposes?

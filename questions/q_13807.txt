Use the following information about tomato inheritance. Assume the genes are not linked.    M = smooth skin                   R = red fruit m = fuzzy skin                        r = yellow fruit   A.  What is the genotype of a homozygous smooth yellow tomato? [genosmoothyellow] B.  What is the genotype of a fuzzy homozygous red tomato? [genofuzzyred] C.  What is the genotype of all the F1 offspring that would be produced by crossing these two tomatoes (A with B)? [F1geno] D.  If a cross occurs between two F1 tomatoes (C), the F2 generation will be produced. This would be an example of a dihybrid cross. What would be the expected phenotypic ratio of that F2 generation? (smooth, red : smooth, yellow : fuzzy, red : fuzzy, yellow) [smred] : [smyel] : [fuzred] : [fuzyel] You do not need to necessarily do a Punnett square.

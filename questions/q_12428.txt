Constance, a sociologist, found a piece of research performed by another sociologist intriguing. It looked at the impact of learning new activities on the aging process. When she read the results, which were reported in a journal she read, she saw that the number of people studied had been very small. But the report itself was well written and enthusiastic. Much as Constance was excited by the findings, she wondered if bias might have affected them. Things looked just a little bit too good. The way to check this would be to _____ the study.

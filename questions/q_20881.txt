Notes before you begin:  I am looking at your explanations and justifications, not the positions you take. Be sure to support what you say and provide evidence. I am not grading your writing, but I do need to understand what you write. Please label each of the three sections of your essay. Shoot for a minimum of 600 words for your total essay, though feel free to go over this word count if you need to; there is no word maximum.    Part 1: What is a "sociological universal"? What is "family"? Explain how "family" qualifies as a "sociological universal." What are the three main components of the "family"? Which of the components make up the "official" definition as defined by the US government? What is the importance of the other component(s)? How has the definition of "family" evolved over time? Be specific.   Part 2: Using the conceptualization of "family" you specified in Part 1, explain trends in and between the following content areas:  The Family in History The Big Three (Race/Ethnicity, Gender/Sexuality, and Social Class) Love and Romantic/Utilitarian Relationships Cohabitation and Marriage Children Family Struggles and Dysfunctions Work    Part 3: In this essay (and throughout the course), we maintained a scientific focus on "what was" and "what is" when it comes to discussions of the family. Now, using your knowledge of the subject matter and what you've written prior to this point, I would like you to consider the future of the family. Use the points above to conjecture, based on evidence from the course, where you believe the "family" is going and project future trends. These conjectures should be realistic and specific (I do not need numbers/percentages, just the trends).

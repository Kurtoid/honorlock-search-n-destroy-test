Please use the following information to answer the question(s) below.Figure 27.2Fishes that have swim bladders can regulate their density and thus their buoyancy. There are two types of swim bladder: physostomous and physoclistous. The ancestral version is the physostomous version, in which the swim bladder is connected to the esophagus via a short tube (Figure 27.2). The fish fills this version by swimming to the surface, taking gulps of air, and directing them into the swim bladder. Air is removed from this version by "belching." The physoclistous version is more derived and has lost its connection to the esophagus. Instead, gas enters and leaves the swim bladder via special circulatory mechanisms within the wall of the swim bladder.Which graph properly depicts the relationship between the amount of gas in the swim bladder and the density of the fish?

Question 14: What would the optimal cycle length (Webster's formulation) and the corresponding effective green times for each phase be?   Optimal cycle length : [v1] s (rounding up to nearest 5 s) effective green time for Phase A: [v2] s (to nearest 0.1 s) effective green time for Phase B: [v3] s (to nearest 0.1 s)   effective green time for Phase C: [v4] s (to nearest 0.1 s) effective green time for Phase D: [v5] s (to nearest 0.1 s)

Key equations and a Periodic Table to be used for the whole quiz are included below:pH = -log[H3O+]pH + pOH = 14[H3O+][OH-]=1.0 x 10-14Kw=1.0 x 10-14pKa=-log(Ka)pKa + pKb=14Free Response 1: A 0.22 M solution of weak acid HB has a pH of 5.0. What is the Ka of this acid? (5 points)Free Response 2: The pyridinium ion, C5H5NH+, has a Ka of 5.6 x 10-6. Determine the pH of a 3.9 M solution of the pyridinium ion. (5 points)Free Response 3: Determine the pH and concentrations of all species present at equilibrium (H2C6H6O6, HC6H6O6-, C6H6O62-, H3O+, and OH-) of a 0.0930 M solution of the diprotic acid H2C6H6O6. . (12 points)Free Response 4: A solution is created by combining 0.25 moles of NH3 with 0.80 moles of NH4+ in 2.0 L of total solution. If the Kb of NH3 is 1.8 x 10-5, determine the pH of this solution. (5 points)Free Response 5: A titration is run between a 0.026 M solution of HX and NaOH. If the Kb of X- is 1.0 x 10-7, determine the pH of this solution at the equivalence point. (5 points)

I understand that once I begin the quiz, I CANNOT have a cell phone, tablet, second computer, notes, books  etc. in my work area. My desk area is completely clean. I MUST show my desk AND do a 360-degree room scan with the camera on my computer to prove that I do not have any prohibited items on my desk. If you have not already done so, show the camera your desk area AND do a 360-degree room scan. Note: if you do not do a 360-degree scan, you WILL be penalized. Anything less than 360 degrees leaves the possibility that you have another device or notes sitting in the area you did not show and I HAVE seen students attempt to get away with this.  Violation of any of the above will result in a minimum 20 point penalty, up to forfeiture of ALL points earned.

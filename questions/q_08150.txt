A ten-loop coil having an area of 0.23 m2 and a very large resistance is in a 0.047-T uniform magnetic field oriented so that the maximum flux goes through the coil. The coil is then rotated so that the flux through it goes to zero in 0.34 s. What is the magnitude of the average emf induced in the coil during the 0.34 s?
Spaulding sign refers to which of the following?
The IEEE 802.15. 4 standard provides two modes of connections: beacon enabled mode and non-beacon enabled mode.  When multiple devices access the channel, to avoid the collision, the slotted Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) algorithm is deployed in beacon enabled mode whereas the unslotted CSMA/CA algorithm is used in non-beacon enabled mode. Draw a figure to show the unslotted CSMA/CA algorithm and explain it. What are the differences between slotted CSMA/CA and unslotted CSMA/CA? Please answer this question on the physical paper since a figure is required to draw.

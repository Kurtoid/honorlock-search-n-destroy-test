According to fossil records and recent published observations, two species of leaf eating beetles (species A and B) have existed on an isolated island in the Pacific Ocean for over 100,000 years. In 1964 a third species of leaf-eating beetle (species C) was accidentally introduced on the island. The population size of each species has been regularly monitored as shown in the graph above.   Propose an explanation for the pattern of population density observed in species C.  Describe the effect that the introduction of beetle species C has had on the population density of species A and species B. Propose an explanation for the patterns of population density observed in species A and in species B.  Predict the population density of species C in 2014. Provide a biological explanation for your prediction.  Explain why invasive species are often successful in colonizing new habitats.

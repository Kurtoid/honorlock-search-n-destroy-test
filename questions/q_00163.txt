Pthread Barriers. This is a scary-looking question whose answer is actually simple. In the previous question (question 13), if the answer is Yes, explain how. If the answer is No, describe a minimal change to one or both calls (pthread_barrier_init() and pthread_barrier_wait()) to allow POSIX Barriers to additionally be used for Quorum Consensus. That is for the processes who attempt to join the barrier through pthread_barrier_wait() to overcome the barrier and proceed if there is a quorum of such processes who did the same. Give specific changes to the calls showing any new parameters or any pseudo code of variable definitions, or describe what you would do. Specific answer will earn more credit. The barriers system calls are listed below:     pthread_barrier_init (pthread_barrier_t *barrier, const pthread_barrierattr_t *attr, unsigned int count);     pthread_barrier_wait (pthread_barrier_t *barrier);      (No more than 100 words).

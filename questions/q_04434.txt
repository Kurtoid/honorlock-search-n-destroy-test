A nurse named Alex has a small population of potentially pathogenic Bacteria B living inside him, but it is not causing him any problems because his microbiome keeps Bacteria B's population small. At some point, Alex internalizes non-pathogenic Bacteria A, which is resistant to the antibiotic Tetracycline.  A few months later, Alex becomes sick due to Bacteria B. What occurred to cause this to happen?    1. Bacteria A transfer Tetracycline resistance genes to Bacteria B.  2. More nutrients and space than normal are available in Alex's body to Tetracycline-resistant bacteria.  3. The entire population of Bacteria A and Bacteria B is killed by Tetracycline except the individuals that contain Tetracycline resistance genes. Other bacterial species susceptible to Tetracycline are also killed.  4. The population of Bacteria B grows to become a much larger percentage of Alex's microbiome than it was before Alex took Tetracycline.  5. Alex takes a course of Tetracycline to treat a urinary tract infection.

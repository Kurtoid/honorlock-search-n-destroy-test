A nutrition store in the mall is selling an herbal supplement intended to influence memory. To test the effectiveness (i.e., the influence on memory) of the herbal mixture, a skeptical researcher obtains a sample of n = 49 people and requests that each person take the suggested dosage each day for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4-week period, each individual takes a standardized memory test (large numbers indicate better memory). The scores from the sample produced a mean of M = 33. In the general population, the standardized memory test is known to have a mean of u = 30 and s = 14. Do the sample data support the conclusion that the herbal supplement influenced memory? To answer this question, go through the 7 steps for hypothesis testing and use a = .05 (critical value = +-1.96). SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. 1) IV: [IV] DV: [DV] number of tails: [tails] 2) State Hypotheses: Null: [Null] Alternative: [Alternative] 3) Describe where the critical region(s) would be on a distribution. [critical] 4) Calculate the z-score for the sample mean (if possible bold, underline, or indicate your final answer). Show your work. Numerator for z-score = [Numerator] Denominator for z-score = [Denominator] z-obtained = [z-score] 5) Decision: [Decision] 6) Effect size:  Calculation/work: [Calculation] d = [Effect] 7) Plain English interpretation: [PE] APA statistical information: [APA]

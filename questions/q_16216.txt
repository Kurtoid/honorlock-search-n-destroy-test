Christine has been charged with burglary and assault for breaking into the home of her ex- boyfriend one night and then threatening him once she was inside. Christine wanted to get back the expensive watch that she had given her ex-boyfriend (just before he broke up with her), and she threatened him with a knife to make him give it back. Not surprisingly, Christine was very intoxicated that night. She is normally quite reserved. Christine can establish that her blood alcohol content that night was .24% because she got pulled over while she was driving home afterward. (That charge is not at issue here.) Christine wants to rely on a voluntary intoxication defense at trial. In her State, "burglary" is defined as "breaking and entering a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony therein," and "assault" is defined as "to unlawfully put another in fear of imminent serious bodily injury." Regarding which crime(s) should the trial judge instruct Christine's jury on the defense of voluntary intoxication--under the approach of most common-law jurisdictions?

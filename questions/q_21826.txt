Consider the previous problem and the same figure copied below. (All link costs in the network have strictly positive values.)  Suppose the value of the link cost from Node 1 to Node 3 changes.  What kind of change in the value (e.g., greater than x or less than y) would cause Node 1 to have to generate a new minimum-cost path to Node "8" in the next run of the distance vector algorithm?  Answer format a) What is the change in the value of the link from node 1 to node 3 would cause a new route calculation at Node 1? The value should be greater than [Greaterthanvalue] The value should be less than [Lessthanvalue] b) How will this impact the minimum cost calculation?  Enter impact in one or two sentences: [Impact]

Question #11: The Baltimore Orioles are selling 3000 specially priced tickets each on two different promotional days during the regular season: Student's Day and Military Appreciation Day. The same seats were set aside for each promotional day on the following levels: Field, Terrace, and Upper Reserved. The price for tickets on Student's Day differs from the cost on Military Appreciation Day. On Student's Day, the Orioles sold $43,975 worth of tickets and on Military Appreciation Day, the Orioles sold $53,150 worth of tickets. The table illustrates the cost per ticket for each level on both promotional days.      Tickets Student's Day Military Appreciation Day   Field Level $20 $25   Terrace Level $17 $20   Upper Reserved $10 $12      a)  Since there are three types of tickets (based on the level of the seat), let the variables x = Field Level Tickets, y = Terrace Level Tickets, and z = Upper Reserved Tickets. There is a total of 3000 tickets for each promotional day, therefore one equation can be expressed as:   Using the information provided above, develop two additional equations using x, y, and z.   b) Using the three equations from part (a), write an augmented matrix.   c) Use your calculator to obtain a matrix is Row-Echelon Form (REF) or Reduced Row-Echelon Form (RREF). Write this resulting matrix on your Test Paper.   d)  Using your answer from (c), how many of each type of ticket was sold? Field Level: ____________ Terrace Level: ____________ Upper Reserved: ____________

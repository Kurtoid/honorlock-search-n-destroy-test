Newton's second law: The International Space Station has a mass of 1.8 x 105 kg. A 70.0-kg astronaut inside the station pushes off one wall of the station so she accelerates at 1.50 m/s2. What is the magnitude of the acceleration of the space station as the astronaut is pushing off the wall? Give your answer relative to an observer who is space walking and therefore does not accelerate with the space station due to the push.

Sales goals are a critical part of any sales management system. There are typically two different types of management systems - those that are results or outcome based and those that are activity or behavior based. Depending upon the type of management system that is used, the sales goals may be very different. There is a way to "connect" these two types of goals and therefore "connect" the two types of management systems. The mechanism for this connecting process is:

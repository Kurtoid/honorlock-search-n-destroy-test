The following questions are about security.    (a) A de-identified and anonymized D has been made public. Each quasi-identifier (QID) in D appears in at least n rows. Furthermore, values of the sensitive data elements in D are all unique (no two tuples have the same value for the sensitive element). If D satisfies k-anonymity and l-diversity requirements, what are the values of k and l when n=10 and the total number of tuples is 1,000,000? (5 pts.)(b) How will the utility of D change when l is increased? (5 pts.)  (a) MacOS and iOS send information from our devices to Apple that could have an impact on our privacy. According to some reports, for information collected by iOS, Apple claims to provide differential privacy guarantees with epsilon = 14. There are approximately 300 million people in the United States. Assume a certain sensitive property about a person of interest is true only for a single user when no information is shared with Apple. Thus, the random chance that Alice is the person of interest is 1/300000000 in this case. Assume that the information carried by iOS could be used with available auxiliary information to answer the question if Alice is the person of interest. With differential privacy and epsilon = 14, what is the probability that Alice is likely the person of interest when Alice shares her information with Apple. First, write the formula that relates the probabilities of an inference when Alice chooses to share and not share her information. (2 pts.)(b) After this, estimate the probability of the inference attack for the given value of epsilon. You can assume that e14 is approximately 1.2 million. (3 pts.)(c) Do you consider 14 as a reasonable value for epsilon? (2 pts.)  True or false: Elements in a tuple can have different access classes even when the tuple access class is the same as the access class of the tuple's primary key element. Explain your answer. (3 pts.)  Assume a poly-instantiation model where null values have the same access class as the primary key in the tuple.  All instances of a multi-level relation have the same tuple access class for a tuple with a certain primary key value. True or false: All element values in the tuple have the same access class. Explain your answer. (5 pts.)  In a certain system, TS or top secret is the highest clearance level. A TS user executes an update transaction on a multi-level secure system that supports the SeaView model of poly-instantiation.  Which of the following are possible outcomes of this update transaction: (i) no poly-instantiation occurs, (ii) visible poly-instantiation occurs, and (iii) invisible poly-instantiation occurs. Briefly explain your answer. (5 pts.)  Since SeaView is concerned about confidentiality, it must also address covert channels. Describe a storage covert channel in SeaView that a secret user can create to transmit information to a user cleared at a lower access level. (5 pts.)

No single authority has the power to pass laws that protect the entire ocean. Instead, each nation manages and protects the ocean resources along its coastlines, leaving the shared common space beyond any particular jurisdiction vulnerable to pollution. Throughout the world's oceans, garbage has begun to accumulate in the center of circular currents, or gyres. These giant patches of ocean garbage occur because many different countries allow solid waste to enter the oceans from land or ships. Destruction of ocean ecosystems because of garbage, especially plastic pollutants, is likely to affect every person on the planet as these pollutants cycle through the food chain. This is an example of
While young men could work at a variety of occupations, young women had more limited options. The textile mills provided suitable employment for the daughters of Yankee farm families. Needing to reassure anxious parents that their daughters' virtue would be protected and hoping to avoid what they viewed as the problems of industrialization--filth, and vice--the Boston Associates established strict rules governing the lives of these young workers. The women lived in company-owned boarding houses to which they paid a portion of their wages. What were the Lowell women forbidden to do?

Molly is 84 years old.  She is complaining that she does not understand well with her hearing aids.  Everyone is speaking too fast and she was recently diagnosed with dementia.  You review demographics and find that the wrong birthdate was entered.  She was entered as a pediatric patient, so her prescription and algorithms were based on a child.  You see that she has MPOs set at 100, wide dynamic range compression, and fast attack and release times.  Which one of these programming options would you change? What would you change it to?

Skill B2.  (This problem is based on the port selection problem described by De Icaza et al., 2019.)  Suppose that the decision-maker is concerned with only four attributes (depth, number of berths, number of cranes, and traffic delay), and a linear multiattribute utility function (w1 u1 + w2 u2 + w3 u3 + w4 u4) is a reasonable model of the decision-maker's preferences (u1 = utility for depth, u2 = utility for berths, u3 = utility for cranes, and u4 = utility for delay).  Swing weighting is used to determine the weights on these four attributes.  The five hypothetical alternatives are H0 (every attribute has its worst value), H1 (best value of depth), H2 (best value of number of berths), H3 (best value of number of cranes), and H4 (best value of traffic delay), and these have the following scores: 0, 100, 50, 85, and 15.  Determine values for the weights that are consistent with these scores.

A coffee machine dispenses coffee into paper cups. You're supposed to get 10 ounces of coffee, but the amount varies slightly from cup to cup. Here are the amounts measured in a random sample of 20 cups.  The amounts have a mean of 9.845 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.199 ounces.   We are interested to know if there is evidence that the machine is shortchanging customers.

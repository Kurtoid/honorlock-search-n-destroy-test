Problem 1. Hot water at an average temperature of 90 oC is flowing through a 15-m section of a cast iron pipe (k= 52 W/m.K) whose inner and outer diameters are 4 cm and 4.6 cm, respectively. The outer surface of the pipe is exposed to the cold air at 10 oC in the basement with a heat transfer coefficient of 15 W/m2.K. The heat transfer coefficient at the inner surface of the pipe is 120 W/m2.K. Taking the basement temperature to be at 10 oC, determine (a) the rate of heat loss from the hot water, and (b) the surface temperature of the pipe. (c) If the emissivity of the pipe is 0.7, how will this impact the heat loss from the pipe compared to when you did not consider the emissivity?

Diffusion is an active process in which molecules move from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration.
In each of the following short sketches, the investigators (or teachers) did something foolish. They made at least one gross error. (They also may have done some other things that were less than ideal.) Try to identify the gross error(s) or serious mistake(s).  In a short paragraph (most likely a sentence or two will suffice), indicate what was done wrong (or said incorrectly) and why it is an error and how it should have been done differently. Make sure to label each answer to match the corresponding question using number and letter (II-A, II-B, or II-C). Suggested time: 30 minutes.  Federal law requires all school districts to test students at the end of the academic year in mathematics and reading in grades 3 through 8. A school district hired Prof. Patternmaker to determine if average performance in reading was changing significantly between grades 3 and 6. Prof. Patternmaker used independent t-tests and an alpha of .05 to evaluate the data and answer the questions. A high school student was given a scale that measures anxiety. His score was very high. Before we can validly assume the student is very anxious, what do we need to know about the scale. For example, we need to know if the scale is based on a sound theory of anxiety. What else do we need to know (in a couple of sentences)? A doctoral student was doing a study that asked the following--do background knowledge, sustained attention, and language ability significantly predict the quality of text notes students record in the domain of history. The doctoral student was able to use commercially published, high quality instruments to measure language and attention but had to develop his own instrument to evaluate background knowledge. He developed the instrument and tested it with a representative sample of graduate students (N = 150). The coefficient alpha was .86. He then ran the experiment with undergrads at a local university (N = 150). Surprisingly, the coefficient alpha was .65.

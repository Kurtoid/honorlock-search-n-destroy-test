The General Social Survey is a survey completed by adults living in the United States. In 2018 and 2002, respondents were asked if the most important idea for a child to learn was to work hard.  In 2018 (group 1), 415 out of 1542 said it was to work hard. In 2002  (group 2), 190 out of 899 said it was to work hard. For the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference between the two years (Ha: p2 - p1 does not equal 0), what is the test statistic?  Round your answer to two decimal places. Make sure to include a negative sign if appropriate.

For the following questions, you can either type your solution below (in the textbox) or write it on a number of papers, take pictures of the papers at the end of the exam and upload it through the link provided below.   (5 points) Consider a raster system with resolution of 1680 by 1050. What size frame buffer (in bytes) is needed if the full RGBA system is used to store the color of each pixel? (15 points) In the following image, the background is white (first layer). The second layer is the circle which is colored by blue color with alpha = 0.5. The third layer is the square which is colored by green color with alpha = 0.3. Finally, the fourth layer is a heart shape colored by red with alpha = 0.6. Find the color of area specified by letter X in this figure assuming that colored are blended in the same way that OpenGL blends them to acquire the transparency effect.

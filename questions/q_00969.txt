People keep their money in a bank account because the bank pays interest on their investment. ONce a month, the bank adds money to your account, based on your current balance and the rate of interest.  That additional money then becomes part of your balance. Therefore, next month, you will earn interest on the original balance plus the interest from last month. This compounding of interest over time leads to rapid growth. Many biologists relate the way that money grows in a bank to the way that some populations grow. Which model of population growth corresponds best to a model of financial growth: 1) an exponential model, 2) a geometric model, 3) a logistic model, or 4) a matrix model? Be sure to relate the assumptions of the model to the process of financial growth described above.

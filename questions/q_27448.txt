Psychology experiments sometimes involve testing the ability of rats to navigate mazes. A specific maze in a laboratory is believed that it will take rats a mean of one minute to solve it. A researcher experimented with 21 rats and found that the mean time was 52.21 sec with a sample standard deviation of 13.24 seconds. Check at a 0.01 level of significance his claim that the actual maze does not meet the "one-minute average" criterion (Hint: 1 min= 60 sec). Assume the distribution of the times is approximately normal  Requirements: Hypothesis Statement: Test Statistic: P-Value: Express your Conclusion in complete sentences:

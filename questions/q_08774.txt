This problem requires you to show your work and upload at the end of the test. Solve the system of equations using GAUSS Elimination/Matrices showing all row operations. Fill in the blank: If the system is consistent/independent write your answer as (x,y,z).  If the system is consistent/dependent write your answer as an ordered triple using only variable z. If the system is inconsistent write "no solution". Show all steps!     x  +  y  -  2z  =  -2   x  -  y  + 4z =  8 2x  - y + 5z =  -7

Skill D5. Joe and Rose are engineers on a design team.  Each one has a subsystem to design, and each one also contributes to the system design.  Each chooses how much effort to spend designing the subsystem; the remainder of the time is spent designing the system.  Each one will receive a year-end bonus based on the quality of the subsystem and the system.  Based on the incentives in place and estimates of how their effort affects the performance of the subsystems and the system, they formulate the following two-player, simultaneous, mixed-motive game.  In this table, each cell is (Rose's bonus, Joe's bonus).     (Subsystem effort)   Joe: low   Joe: medium   Joe: high     Rose: low   ($1,168, $1,669)   ($1,134, $1,738)   ($1,071, $1,681)     Rose: medium   ($1,309, $1,635)   ($1,246, $1,675)   ($1,133, $1,567)     Rose: high   ($1,342, $1,573)   ($1,229, $1,562)   ($1,022, $1,361)     Which of the following statements about this game is true?

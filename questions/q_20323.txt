Quicksilver A distributed service in Quicksilver is opting to use the recovery management provided by the operating system.  Any client of this service will touch server nodes S1, S2, and S3, in that order to execute the service.  The service will result in the creation of intermediate files f1, f2, and f3 on these nodes, respectively.  All these intermediate files will be ultimately removed by the service once a client terminates normally. The service designates S1 as the coordinator for recovery management.  The service uses 2-phase commit for its recovery operation.  When the service is just about to complete, the client node crashes.  (c) (2 points) What actions will ensue due to the client crash?  (d) (2 points) What will be the end result?

QUESTION 4     Use this information to answer the following questions: You push a 3.5kg tin resting on a tabletop to the right and you have to exert a force of 2.67 N to start the tin sliding. Once it is sliding, however, you can use a force of only 1.5 N to keep the tin moving with a constant speed.         4.1   What is the magnitude and direction of the normal force?   (2)     4.2   What is the coefficient of static friction between the table and the tin?   (2)     4.3   What is the kinetic frictional force?   (2)     4.4   What is the resultant/net force on the tin while it is moving?   (2)     4.5   Draw a force diagram for the tin as it is sliding in a positive direction to the right.Make sure to include all labels and values.   (3)             [11]

Use the following scenario for the next 4 questions (Questions 11, 12, 13, and 14): Many rocks contain trace amounts of uranium.  A scientist notices that the radioactive element uranium (U) loses its toxicity when incubated in soil for several weeks. He wonders, "How is the soil detoxifying the uranium?" After several days in the university library, he uncovers a report that describes a soil bacterium that can detoxify uranium. He reasons that the native soil bacteria might be responsible for detoxifying the uranium. After splitting a soil sample into six equal portions, he sterilizes 3 portions using high heat and pressure (i.e., kills all bacteria in the sample), and the other 3 he leaves intact (normal live bacteria). Then he adds uranium to all samples and measures the toxicity of the uranium over the next several weeks. To his surprise, uranium from both the sterilized and the intact soil diminish in toxicity.   Assume that the scientist can accurately measure the radioactivity of the uranium.  Would you expect that all 3 control samples would have the exact same uranium radioactivity following the experiment?  Why or why not (1 sentence).

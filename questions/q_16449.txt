Can mice find their way faster through a labyrinth after consuming caffeine? Professor Chaos thinks so. To provide evidence Professor Chaos purchases a dozen house mice at the pet store and randomly divides the mice into two groups of size 6. In one group the mice receive a dose of 100 mg per kg body weight, 60 minutes prior to placing the mice at the entrance to a labyrinth that has a piece of cheese at the center. Professor Chaos measures the time it takes each mouse to reach the cheese. Unfortunately, one of the mice in the control group had an encounter with Professor Chaos' cat before the experiment. Here are the results measured in seconds. Caffeine: 31, 41, 38, 44, 58, 49Control: 70, 66, 53, 59, 83 Is there evidence that caffeine shortens the time it takes to solve the labyrinth?

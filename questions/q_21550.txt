You must do this one. 5. Use this figure and/or table to help answer this question.     Figure 24 Note: in reading the graph, I will take into account that you may not be able to come up with exact numbers.  But I expect you to read as accurately as possible. Note: in entering your answers:1. Use proper units in all cases.2. Except for the calculation, DO NOT put any spaces into your answers.   This is to make it easier for the computer to recognize correct answers.  If you put spaces in and I have to grade it by hand, you will not receive full credit.3. DO NOT use a zero when you meant to type a capital "O" or vice versa.  They are NOT the same to the computer.  Assume that the temperature is 40oC.  If there are currently 12gH2O/kgAir of water vapor present in the atmosphere, then:  What is the Specific Humidity? [SpecHum] What is the Saturation Specific Humidity? [WVC] What is the relative humidity? [RH] (give the value to one numeral after the decimal point) Show your calculation for relative humidity: [calculation](Note: use the operators + - / * for your calculation.  Put a space between your operators and your numbers or variables.  You do not need to say "= RH" or anything like that. At approximately what temperature will precipitation begin (i.e. the Dew Point)? [DewPoint]You may not be able to get an exact value, but be as acccurate and precise as you can.  I will accept a range of values.

Q. 1 (40 pts) The basic operations of a fruit selling company is the following:  Production cost and restrictions: Each month the cost of production (harvesting and boxing) per unit fruit is ct for the next 5 months t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. At most ft units of fruits can be produced in month t for t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Demand: The demand for fruit in the next 5 months is dt for t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We must (at least) meet this demand, but can sell more than the demand. In month t, the selling price of the fruits for the first dt units is pt per unit fruit and the selling price of fruits sold beyond demand dt is 0.5pt per unit fruit.  Inventory and fruit juice: The company has inventory capacity of storing fruits. The cost of storing fruits is vt per unit fruit from month t to t + 1. All inventory left at the end of month 5 should be converted into juice and sold at j per unit. Each unit of fruit yields 0.7 units of juice.      Formulate an LP to maximize the net profit (i.e. money obtained from selling fruits & juice - total cost) of this fruit selling company.  Write Gurobi-python code for solving your model.

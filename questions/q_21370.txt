Read the following speech introduction.  Then, answer the next three questions by utilizing the information from the described situation.  Please close your eyes for a minute. Now imagine you have been hiking through rough terrain for five days. Your feet hurt, your legs hurt, you probably even smell. You started at an elevation around nine thousand feet and at times have crossed peaks of 13,780 feet high! That is higher than the altitude I was at when I jumped out of a plane! You've begun descending into green trees and vines when all of a sudden you come to a broad plateau and as you look out you can vaguely see, under 400 years worth of overgrowth, the distinct and spectacular masonry work of the Incas. All of your fatigue washes away as you realize that you have just stumbled upon the ancient city of Machu Picchu. Now, open your eyes. What I have just described to you is very similar to what Hiram Bingham saw when he rediscovered Machu Picchu in 1911 as described by author Bruce Fellman in his 2007 Internet article "Rediscovering Machu Picchu."  I will be studying abroad in Cuzco, Peru in the fall for five months so I have done a lot of research on Peru specifically the Inca culture.  Most people say "Yeah, I've heard of Machu Picchu, but I don't really know what it is." After hearing my speech, you will be able to put that uncertainty behind you because understanding history is important in understanding our future.  Machu Picchu is a significant cultural artifact of Peru.  The three areas that illustrate this cultural significance are as a symbol of the Inca Empire, as a symbol of the current culture and pride of the indigenous people, and as a symbol of Peru on a global scale.  In the above introduction, the statement, "I will be studying abroad in Cuzco, Peru in the fall for five months so I have done a lot of research on Peru, and specifically the Inca culture," best serves which function in this introduction?

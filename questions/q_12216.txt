Remember: With exogenous taxes, T = T, the multiplier on DG is   DY / DG = 1/ (1-mpc) The multiplier on changes in taxes                                                         DY / DT  = -mpc / (1-mpc) With proportional taxes, T = tY, the multiplier on DG is                DY / DG = 1/ [1-mpc (1-t)]   DC = mpc * (DY- DT). Assume the economy's marginal propensity to consume is 0.8. Suppose that businesses decrease investment.  To avoid a recession, the government decreases tax of $5 billion such that total demand (C+I+G) remains unchanged (that is, DT = -5). How much did investment decrease?

Question 3 (50 pts) A circuit is shown below.  Circuit parameters are as follow: threshold voltage Vth = 1V, kn' = mnCox = 100mA/V2, l=0 (no channel length modulation), VDD = 5V, VSS = -5V, RG = 10MO, RS=1.5kO, RL=20kO.  The 1mA DC current source is ideal. Assume the MOSFET transistor is in the saturation mode. The signal source vi has zero resistance. 1. Perform DC analysis and find the gate voltage VG, source voltage VS, and the required aspect ratio . 2. Draw the small signal model of the complete circuit. 3. Calculate the voltage gain  , the input resistance Rin, and the output resistance Rout as noted in the figure.

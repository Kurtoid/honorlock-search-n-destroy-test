The equilibrium potential (Ex) for Ca2+ and Cl- are +134mV and -65mV, respectively. Both ions are permeable to the membrane via leak channels.  The Ca2+ leak channels expel Ca2+ out of the cell and Cl- leak channels bring Cl-  In addition, there are a greater number of leak channels for Cl- to enter the cell.  How would this change the resting membrane potential?

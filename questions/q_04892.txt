Suppose Host A sends five TCP segments consecutively to Host B over a TCP connection. The first segment has sequence number 70; the second has sequence number 140; the third has sequence number 180; the fourth has sequence number 210; the fifth has sequence number 290. The fifth segment has 50 bytes. If the third and fourth segments are lost before they reach B, but the first, second and fifth segments arrive in order at B, what will  be the acknowledgement number that B sends to A for the fifth packet?

Ace contracted to sell widgets to Zenith (including provisions on quantity and price, omitted here for brevity). The contract specified that all widgets must be made of a copper/zinc alloy containing at least 50% copper. In fact, the manufacturing process in which Zenith uses the widgets only requires 30% copper. However, Zenith always specifies 50% in its contracts to avoid any problem with widgets that don't quite comply with the spec. Ace delivered the widgets on the precise day they were due, at which time Zenith visually inspected the widgets and then set them aside for further subsequent testing. Three days later Zenith, performed chemical testing on the widgets (the only way to determine the chemical makeup of the alloy), discovered that they are they contained only 40% copper, and promptly notified Ace of the problem. Which of the following issues will most likely determine whether or not Zenith must keep and pay for the widgets?

Requirements and use case analysis: For the following four questions, suppose that you are developing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse. (Note that we said "developing", not "developing in".)   State any two verifiable functional requirements for the IDE [2 points].   State any two verifiable non-functional requirements for the IDE [2 points].   Describe the "Create Project" use case in detail, listing the actor actions and system responses in sequence for the main (success) scenario using the two-column format discussed in the class. Note that in the main scenario, a new project is created from scratch, i.e., there is no existing source code [3 points].   Describe an alternative scenario where the project is created from existing source code in a directory [2 points].   Draw a use case diagram showing the actor(s) and six use-cases, one of which must be "Create Project." [3 points].

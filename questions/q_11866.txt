After informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and sedated.

The physician decided not to advance to the cecum due to the impaction and the scope was pulled back into the descending colon and then slowly withdrawn.  The mucosa was examined in detail along the way and was entirely normal.  Upon reaching the rectum, retroflex examination of the rectum was normal.  The scope was then straightened out, the air removed and the scope withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

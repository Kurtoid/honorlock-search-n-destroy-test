Once you know the critical value and test statistic, a decision about the null hypothesis and a conclusion in terms of the claim is required. Suppose you know the following when performing a hypothesis test:  The claim is the alternative hypothesis. The test is a left-tailed test. The critical value is -1.96. The test statistic is -1.31.  Determine whether the null hypothesis is rejected or not, and make a decision in context of the claim.  Decision: [1] Conclusion: [2]

QUESTION 3     A ball, A, is thrown vertically upwards from a height, h, with a speed of 15 m [?] s-1. AT THE SAME MOMENT, a second, identical ball, B, is dropped from the same height as ball A as shown in the attached diagram. Both balls undergo free fall and eventually hit the ground. USE UPWARDS AS POSITIVE.   Right click on the following blue button to open the diagram in a new tab.       3.1   What does the term free fall mean?   (2)     3.2   Calculate the time it takes ball A to return to its starting point.   (4)     3.3   Calculate the distance between ball A and ball B when ball A is at its maximum height.   (7)     3.4   Sketch a velocity-time graph for the motion of ball A from the time it is projected until it hits the ground. Clearly show the following on your graph: * The initial speed * The time it takes to reach its maximum height * The time it takes to return to its starting point   (4)             [17]

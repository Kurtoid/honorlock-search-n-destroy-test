Dollar Shave Club is coming out with a new razor to sell to women online. This razor will specifically have moisturizing qualities that help moisturize the skin. Dollar did a concept test and got the following results:    Definitely Would Buy 50%   Probably Would Buy 20%   May or May Not Buy 15%   Probably Would Not Buy 10%   Definitely Would Not Buy 5%    Dollar's historical concept testing indicates that 80% of those that claim they definitely would buy will actually buy and 30% of those that say they probably would buy actually buy. Those that were inclined to buy were sent a package of razors to test. After using the razors for a week, a follow up question was asked about how likely consumers would be to repeat buy. Approximately 70% of respondents said they would keep buying. Because Dollar is a subscription service, they do NOT reduce this number as they believe it is a reliable measurement of those that will actually repeat. The average number of razors among those that repeat are expected to buy in a year is 20. Finally, Dollar expects to gain awareness of this product of 20% and, since they are an online service, expects availability to be 90% (basically the number of those potential customers with access to the internet.) If there are 100 million women in the target market, what can Dollar estimate its first year sales to be?  (Please be clear on your volume prediction and please show your work for partial credit)

Question 13 a You have been roped into helping a friend babysit, and are now playing go-fish with one child.  In this game each person starts with 5 cards. Assume that your cards are dealt first, and then your partner's cards are dealt.  b) Suppose that in your starting hand you have the following values: 3, 7, 9, J, A.  If you ask your partner if they have any 7s, what is the probability that they will say yes?   notes about go-fish: assume that they cannot lie and that if they started with exactly 2 or 4 7s that those cards would have already been played and are no longer in their hand (so the answer would be no, they do not have any 7s) if they started with 3 7s then 2 would have been discarded and they have 1 left (so the answer would be yes)

A semi-tractor-trailer truck consists of a tractor unit (mtractor=8,000 kg) and two semi-trailers to carry freight (mtrailer=10,000 kg). The tractor is capable of exerting 7.00 x 105 N force on the road to accelerate the truck forward. What is the maximum amount of cargo (in kg) that can be added to the truck so that the truck will be able to move up a hill with 35o of inclination? Consider that the truck is stationary.   Useful information: The static friction coefficient between the truck and a dry road is mS=0.9 The kinetic friction coefficient of the truck on a dry road is mK=0.7 The surface area of the front of the truck is A=10m2 The drag coefficient of the truck is C=35.5 The density of the air is r =1.21 kg/m3

Mr. and Mrs. Z, both in their late 30s, file a joint tax return for 2020. They have one dependent child who is age 7. They spent $2,000 for after-school care for the child. Mr. Z is an employee with wages = $100,000. Federal tax withholding from his paycheck = $16,000. Their itemized deductions = $30,000. Any preferential tax rate = 0%. Allowable adjustment for retirement account contribution = $5,000. Mrs. Z runs a part-time business that she operates as a sole proprietor. This year's information is as follows: Revenue $40,000, Cost of Goods Sold, $16,000, Other Expenses = $4,500 (including cost recovery = $800 and entertainment of clients = $500). She sold some business assets, one for a gain of $1,100, all of which is subject to depreciation recapture, and the others for a net loss of $1,800. Mr. and Mrs. Z have some investments. This year they received $3,000 interest income from an investment in bonds issued by the state of Alabama. They also sold two stocks they had held for several years, one for a gain of $6,000 and one for a loss of $4,000. They received the full amount of economic income payments in 2019 and early 2020, so they will not receive any additional amount as a recovery rebate credit when they file their 2020 tax return. Calculate Mr. and Mrs. Z's adjusted gross income (AGI), taxable income, total tax liability, and amount due or refund. Show your work!

Reading and Comprehension. Identifying details. Read the brief excerpt of the article and then  mark if the sentence is true or false. Con 1.5 millones de afrodescendientes, Mexico tiene la cuarta (4ta) poblacion afrodescendiente mas grande de Latinoamerica, solo detras de Brasil, Venezuela y Colombia.

En el Mexico poscolonial se resalto el valor del mestizaje entre indigenas y europeos, mientras se invisibilizo la contribucion africana a la formacion del pais.

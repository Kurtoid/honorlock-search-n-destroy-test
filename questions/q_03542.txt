2 pages Hint: This problem may be easier to solve using SSA representation. A definition of variable is partially dead if the definition is live on some paths and not on others that start at that definition point. A variable is live at a program point p iff there exists a use of that variable along some path which originates at p. Consider an IR statement such as : t = x + y at program point p and t being partially dead at p. You can see that if we evaluate t at p and end up taking a path on which t is never used, we would have carried out a useless evaluation of t. To avoid this, we can sink the evaluation of t = x + y down such it is hoisted at a point m from where t is totally live, ie, is being used along all the paths down from there. Note that the whole IR statement (t = x + y) is moved and hoisted down in such an optimization. Note that in this exercise we are moving the expression's evaluation point downhill, assume that the sets partial_dead_in[B] and partial_dead_out[B], live_in[B] and live_out[B] are already found for you. You will first determine if one can find a program point where partial deadness can be completely removed (edge placement allowed), if not perform the best effort placement where deadness is minimized. The constraints of the placement are that: a path should not be elongated and placement should be legal.     (I) Show a small example using CFG to illustrate the code motion for removing partial deadness. Show two examples where partial deadness can be completely removed and where it can be partially removed with best effort. Explain your answers     (II) Devise a placement algorithm that considers potential placement points and achieves best placement under all the constraints of semantic legality. Hint: Remember to take into account all the implications of moving t=x+y down from a program point p to a point m.     (III) Show how it works on a small example. These could be the same examples in (I).

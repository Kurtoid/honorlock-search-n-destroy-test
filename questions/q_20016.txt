At 25degC, DGdegf is -620 kJ/mol for SiCl4(g) and -592 kJ/mol for MgCl2(s). Calculate DGdeg for the reaction:                                    SiCl4(g)   +    2  Mg(s)   ------------->    2 MgCl2(s)     +    Si(s)  and determine if the reaction is spontaneous at 25degC if the pressure of SiCl4(g) is 1 atm. A) DGdeg = 28 kJ; the process is spontaneous. B) DGdeg = 28 kJ; the process is nonspontaneous. C) DGdeg = -564 kJ; the process is spontaneous. D) DGdeg = -564 kJ; the process is nonspontaneous.

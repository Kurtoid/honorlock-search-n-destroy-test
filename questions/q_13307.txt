Another blood disease, hemophilia, is caused by the failure of blood to clot.  The genetic basis for the disease is due to one of two dysfunctional clotting factors genes, recessive alleles of Hemophilia A or Hemophilia B. Due to the long history of arranged European royal marriages within a relatively small sample population, the prevalence of both hemophilia and G6PD-deficiency disorder are both high. In fact, in certain family lines sons, but not daughters, are nearly always either born with both G6PD-deficiency and Hemophilia A-disease or are born completely healthy. In other family lines sons, but not daughters, are born about a quarter of the time with both G6PD-deficiency and Hemophilia B. Which of the following arrangement of loci on chromosomes best explains these observations? (G = G6PD gene, A = Hemophilia A, and B = Hemophilia B, X = X chromosome, Y = Y chromosome)

Read this excerpt for use in writing your essay. You will have a total of 75 minutes to read the excerpt and write your essay. (90 Minutes Total from Start of Honorlock) From William Deresiewicz's "The Disadvantages of an Elite Education" (The American Scholar, 2008): "Being an intellectual is not the same as being smart. Being an intellectual means more than doing your homework.  If so few kids come to college understanding this, it is no wonder.  They are products of a system that rarely asked them to think about something bigger than the next assignment.  The system forgot to teach them, along the way to prestige admissions and lucrative jobs, that the most important achievements can't be measured by a letter or a number or a name.  It forgot that the true purpose of education is to make minds, not careers."   Essay Prompt: Compare, Contrast, Reflect In an essay, discuss the author's assertion about the true purpose of education.

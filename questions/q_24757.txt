In the story, "Puppy" by George Saunders, the narration switches from relaying the thoughts of Marie to relaying the thoughts of Callie. For example, a statement from Callie's point of view, when considering the restraint of her son Bo in the yard, expresses the idea that "A yard could be a whole world, like her yard when she was kid had been a whole world" (188). A statement from Marie's point of view about the same restraint expresses this view: Marie stepped to the window and, anthropologically pulling the blind aside, was shocked, so shocked that she dropped the blind and shook her head..." (190). This type of narration could best be described as_________________________ because it uses the pronouns "she" and "her" to reveal the characters' thoughts.

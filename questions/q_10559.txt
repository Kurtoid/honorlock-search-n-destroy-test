Problem 4b) Continuation of the FSM you started in 4a)  ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner. The tool bar has indent functions.   Synchronous part of the FSM Instantiate the register you wrote in problem 2 b) to store the value of nextstate in state. You will see in 4c) there is a state transition table that you will use to determine nextstate. For maximum credit your code should carefully follow the specification, and your grade will depend that. Use the minimum number of lines to accomplish this specification. For problems on this test use System Verilog, always_ff, and always_comb, and don't use reg datatype. Also use proper indentation for organization. Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables. Do not use compiler directives. ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate

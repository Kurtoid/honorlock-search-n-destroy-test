Which of the following is an example of a product of genetic engineering?
In this question, we are going to use a naive model to create the cross-validation process. A naive moving averaging filter forecasting can be done using the average of the m observations before time t to estimate the out-of-sample Xt:      Given the historic data below:    2020_01_20 2020_01_21 2020_01_22 2020_01_23 2020_01_24 2020_01_25 2020_01_26 2020_01_27 2020_01_28 2020_01_29   10 11 12 13 14 13 12 11 10 9      Apply one-step forward rolling cross-validation for the historic data to calculate MAE for a naive MA filter model with m=3, use the initial split size =8 (train size starts with 8).  A. For each step of the cross-validation, write down    The train set of the current step  The forecast value using MA filter m=3  B. Calculate the MAE_validation using the forecast values and actual values.

The expected heterozygosity under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of a particular species is 0.5. The expected average heterozygosity of the populations is 0.5. What is the FST value for this population? FST = (HT - Hs) / (HT)
A music store has a steady annual demand for 4,000 ukuleles.  It costs $2 to store 1 ukulele for 1 year and $160 in delivery charges to place a reorder. (a)If x represents the number of ukuleles ordered at a time, write a cost function that models storage and reorder costs. (b) Using the cost equation found in step (a) and optimization techniques, find the number of ukuleles that should be ordered at a time to minimize cost. (c) How many orders should the music store make during the year to minimize costs?
According to research discussed by your instructor in class, it costs society about ______ dollars a year not to incarcerate an offender in prison.
Which of the following statements regarding mitochondrial disease is FALSE?  STOP! Did you select the FALSE statement?
The method below implements the exponentiation operation recursively by taking advantage of the fact that, if the exponent n is even, then xn = (x n/2)2. Select the expression that should be used to complete the method so that it computes the result correctly. public static double power(double base, int exponent) {  if (exponent % 2 != 0) // if exponent is odd  {  return base * power(base, exponent - 1);   }  else if (exponent > 0)  {  double temp = ________________________ ;  return temp * temp;  }  return base; }
Tea and spices are not included in the USDA Food Patterns. This means that you should consider which of the following when deciding to include them in your diet?
18) Stewart and Roald play in a rock band together. Tonight, they played their first show ever at the First Avenue Club. As they were leaving the stage, Stewart looked out at the audience. If he had to guess, he would have estimated there were about 300 people in the audience.  Later that night, Stewart and Roald were talking about the show.   Roald said, "Could you believe how huge the audience was? We've never had close to that many people at a show!"A year later, Stewart and Roald's band are scheduled to play another show at the First Avenue Club.  Now, when Stewart remembers their previous show, he recalls the audience being really large - maybe 700-800 people.  The change in Stewart's memory is most consistent with what memory issue?
Stanton, Inc. purchased a depreciable asset for $22,000 on April 1, Year 1. The asset will be depreciated using the straight-line method over its four-year useful life. Assuming the asset's salvage value is $2,000, Stanton, Inc.  should recognize depreciation expense in Year 2 in the amount of:

Look at the figure below. Imagine a scenario where the Chthamalus barnacle occupies an entire stretch of rocky beach. One season, a few Balanus barnacles are introduced to the same beach. These two species of barnacle are able to occupy the same habitat (the intertidal zone between high tide and low tide), and for a time, they both live in the entire intertidal zone. However, over time the Balanus barnacles, which are larger and faster breeders, completely take over the lower portion of the habitat (which is better because it does not dry out as long and has more food resources). This example above illustrates which ecological principle?

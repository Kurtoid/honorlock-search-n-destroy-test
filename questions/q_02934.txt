This is the same fact pattern as that above - Question 2 part D. Clint noticed that the Schedule K-1 he just received from ABC Partnership included a $20,000 ordinary business loss allocation. His tax basis in ABC at the beginning of ABC's most recent tax year was $10,000. Comparing the Schedule K-1 he recently received from ABC with the Schedule K-1 he received from ABC last year, Clint noted that his share of ABC partnership debt changes as follows: recourse debt increased from $0 to $2,000, qualified nonrecourse debt increased from $0 to $3,000, and  nonrecourse debt increased from $0 to $3,000. Finally, the Schedule K-1 Clint received from ABC reflected a $1,000 cash contribution he made to ABC during the year. Clint is not a material participant in ABC Partnership, and he received $10,000 of passive income from another investment during the same year he received the loss allocation from ABC. D. How much of the $20,000 loss from ABC can Clint deduct currently, and how much of the loss is suspended because of the excess business loss limitation (ignore prior 3 loss limitation rules)? If one is not applicable, enter N/A. Amount deducted currently = [A] Amount suspended = [B]

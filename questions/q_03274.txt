Elizabeth, a fourth grade student, wrote a paragraph in response to Mr. King's writing prompt: Tell about a time you were treated unfairly. Here's her paragraph: A time I was treated unfairly was when my mother made me wash the dishes; the pots and the pans by myself. Even though I am the younger sibling by a year, my mother did not make Asher, my brother, help me. When I asked why Asher wasn't helping me wash the dishes, my mother's response was, "Boys don't do dishes." "What?!?" I asked in shock. "Boys eat food boys drink soda from a cup and boys even cook! Why can't boys wash dishes?" "Boys don't wash dishes in this house....because I said so," quipped my mother. I was furious hurt and, disappointed in my mother's idea that some way my brother was better than me. As I washed each dish, tears ran down my face in hot anger. "This is not over yet," I thought. Please choose the sentences that show Elizabeth still needs help using commas in a series.

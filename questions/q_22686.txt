What is your average daily power usage?                                                                                  (5 Points) You are measuring the current in a circuit that is operated on a 10V battery. The ammeter reads 50mA. Later, you notice that the current has dropped to 30mA. Eliminating the possibility of a resistance change, you must conclude that the voltage has changed. How much has the voltage of the battery changed? And what is the new value?                                           (5 Points) A certain power supply provides a continues 2W to a load. It is operating at 60% efficiency in a 24-hour period, how many kilowatt-hours does the power supply use?                                                       (5 Points) Three 470  resistors are connected in series with a 48V source. (a) What is the total current in the circuit? (b) What is the voltage across each resistor? (c) what is the minimum power rating of the resistor? (5 Points) Refer to the following figure, Assume the LED drops 2.0V across it when it's on. The maximum current in the LED to be set at 10 mA and the minimum current is 2.0 mA. Choose the values of R1 and R2 to meet these requirements. (10 Points)    10. If you wish to increase the current in a resistor from 10 mA to 15 mA by changing the 20V source, by how many volts should you change the source? b) To what new value should you set it? (c) What is the value of the resistor? (10 Points) 11. Refer to the following figure, (a) Find the total current, (b) Voltage across each resistor, (c) Determine the voltage at each point with respect to ground. (10 Points)

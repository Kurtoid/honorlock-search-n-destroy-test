The color of the fill should be controlled by total sales.  To better convey the idea of "money" please setup the map to use shades of green.  Higher total sales = darker green.  Lower total sales = lighter green. Setup a filter based on the restaurant chain name.  Setup the Viz so that the filter is displayed at the top-right corner of the screen.  That way, an unskilled user can quickly change the filter to display a different chain (or all of the chains) by just clicking a checkbox. Configure the Tooltip to display the following data items:  State, Total Customer Visits, Total Sales.

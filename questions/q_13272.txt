Remember, once time runs out, it is too late to upload your Simio file without significant penalty in points.  You should stop you modeling efforts around 10:00 since at 10:05 you will no longer be able to upload your file. Only two pages of single-sided notes are allowed.  The only scratch paper are the two pages you have for notes.  Handheld calculators are allowed, but not your cell phone.  Do not use the Math.If( ) function. When you are finished, close Simio, then upload the Simio (.spfx) file before time runs out.  Only one upload is allowed. Problem Description Truck arrivals (make these green colored entities) occur at 6AM each day.  The daily truck contains exactly 10 parts 50% of the time and exactly 14 parts 50% of the time.  Since the truck arrives at 6AM, let your stating time of your simulation be 6AM.   In addition to parts arriving by truck, there are individually arriving parts (make these red colored entities) that have exponentially distributed inter-arrival times where the mean inter-arrival time depends on the time of day (in other words, the arrival process of red entities is a non-stationary Poisson process).  Specifically, between 6AM and noon the mean time between arrivals is 20 minutes, between noon and 6PM the mean time between arrivals is 10 minutes, and between 6PM and 6AM the mean time between arrivals is 30 minutes. All parts first go to a batch processor.  This batch processor services two parts at a time and the processing time has a Pert distribution with parameters 20, 25, and 30 minutes.  Both parts in the batch must have the same color (i.e., truck arrivals are always paired with truck arrivals and individual arrivals are always paired with other individual arriving parts).  The batch processor has a queueing priority system, namely, red parts have non-preemptive priority over green parts.  For verification purposes, you should animate the batches so a visual check can be made that the batches sizes are two and both parts in the batch are the same color. After the batch processor, all parts are processed through a single-server processor that treats each part individually (i.e., the batches do not stay together as a unit after the batch processor).  The processing time at the single-server processor for each individual green entity is exponentially distributed with mean 15 minutes and for each individual red entity is exponentially distributed with mean 12 minutes.  After the single-server processor, all parts leave the system.  The following travel times are 5 minutes:  (1) from green source to the batch processor, (2) from red source to the batch processor, (3) from the batch processor to the single-server processor, and (4) from the single-server processor to the exit of the system. All assignment statements and tallies must be done through Processes.  Thus, assignments and data placed in tallies not from within Processes will be ignored. Run the simulation for 50 days with only one replication (i.e., no experiment and no warmup period) and estimate the following based on the 50 days:  (1) The average total number of individual parts in the system at 7AM (note that this is one number including both green and red parts), (2) the total daily throughput of parts for the system, and (3) the average time (in minutes) that a red part that arrives between 6AM and noon spends in the system.  (Note that (3) is the time in system averaged only over those parts that are red and that arrive to the system in the morning.)  These three values must appear in the Results tab.  In a floor label, give the expected (i.e., theoretical) value for the daily throughput.  Note:  We have not used a queueing priority discipline for a batch processor before, but I'm hoping must can figure it out.  Hint:  look for a related property under the category "Other Batching Options".

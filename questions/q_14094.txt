(22 points, 15 mins) Consider a 32-way set associative cache with the following parameters:       Cache size (i.e., the amount of actual data it can hold) of 1024 Mbytes. 32-bit byte-addressable Each memory word contains 4 bytes cache block size is 256 bytes. write-back One dirty bit per word. one valid bit per block. MRU field that records the most recently used cache for that cacheline    (i) (4 points) How big is N in the above picture (show your work)?   (ii) (12 points) The 32-bit memory address is split into block offset, tag, and index as shown below:    As shown above, the memory address is partitioned into b - the number of bits for the block offset; n - the number of bits for the cache index; and t - the number of bits for the tag.  What are the values of t, n, and b  (show your work)?   (iii) (2 point) How many bits are needed for the MRU field in each cacheline?   (iv) (2 points) How many dirty bits are needed in each cacheline?   (v) (2 points) How many tag comparators are needed for the entire cache?

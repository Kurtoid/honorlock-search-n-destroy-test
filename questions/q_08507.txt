The deadly Ebola virus is a threat to both people and gorillas in Central Africa. An outbreak in 2002 and 2003 killed 91 of the 95 gorillas in seven home ranges in the Congo. To study the spread of the virus, measure "distance" by the number of home ranges separating a group of gorillas from the first group infected. Here are data on distance and time in number of days until deaths began in each later group.    Distance, H (in home ranges) Time, D (in days)   134445 42133414346    Find the equation of the regression (best-fit) line that relates the number of home ranges, H, separating a group of gorillas from the first group infected and the number of days, D, until deaths began in the later group.    Use distance as the explanatory variable.   Please round values to 4 decimal places.    The regression equation is D = [yintercept] + [slope]H . Use your equation to predict the number of days until deaths would begin in a group of gorillas if they are separated from a diseased group by a distance of 2 home ranges.   Round your answer to the nearest whole day. The number of days until deaths begin a group of gorillas that are separated from a diseased group by two home ranges is [days] days.

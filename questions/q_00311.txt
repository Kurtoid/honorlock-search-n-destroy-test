She wolde weepe if that she saw a mous / Caught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde.   He knew the tavernes wel in every town, / And every hostiler and tappestere, / Bet than a lazar or a beggestere.  / For unto swich a worthy man as he / Accorded nat, as by his facultee, / To have with sike lazars aquaintance . . . Ther was no dore that he nolde heve of harre / Or breke it at a renning with his heed. And hoote he was, and lecherous as a sparwe, / With scaled browes blake and piled beerd. But greet harm was it, as it thoughte me, / That on his shine a mormal hadde he. Out of the Gospel he tho wordes caughte, / And this figure he added eek therto: / That if gold ruste, what shal iren do? To liven in delit was evere his wone, / For he was Epicurus owene sone, / That heeld opinion that plein delit / Was verray felicitee parfit. Gat-toothed was she, soothly for to saye. / . . . on hir heed an hat / As brood as is a bokeler or a targe. / . . . / In felaweship wel coude she laughe and carpe. A vois he hadde as smal as hath a goot; / Ne beerd hadde he, ne nevere sholde have.

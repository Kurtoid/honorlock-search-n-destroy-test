QUESTION 3         The photograph shows a fruit seller using a yard-arm to weigh fruit. The yard-arm consists of a steel bar about 1 m long, with a basket at one end and aa moveable weight at the other end. It is held up by a hook which is fixed to the bar close to the basket. The diagram shows a yard-arm being used to find the weight of five bananas.    Right click on the button to open the picture of the fruit seller and the diagram of the yard-arm in a new window.         3.1   Where on the diagram is the pivot point?   (1)     3.2   State the principle of moments.   (1)     3.3   The support for the basket is 14.1 cm from the pivot. The moveable weight is 84.6 cm from the pivot and weighs 1.25 N.  Calculate the weight of the five bananas. [ignore weight of steel rod and basket]   (3)     3.4   Calculate the mass in grams of one banana.   (3)     3.5   Suggest two ways that the fruit seller could alter his yard-arm so that he could measure larger weights.   (2)

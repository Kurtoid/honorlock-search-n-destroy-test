Touro College and University System is a community of scholars and learners committed to maintaining the highest standards of personal integrity in all aspects of our professional and academic lives. Students and faculty are expected to share a mutual respect for teaching, learning and the development of knowledge. Because intellectual integrity is a hallmark of scholarly and scientific inquiry as well as a core value of the Jewish tradition on which our university system was founded, students and faculty are expected to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, fairness, professional conduct of academic work and respect for all community members.  Academic honesty supports our shared intellectual culture and our ability to trust one another. Students must avoid all acts of dishonesty, including, but not limited to:  cheating  plagiarizing (presenting the work or ideas of others as your own)    fabricating (making up information, data, or research results)   tampering (unauthorized removal or alteration of College documents, software, equipment, or other academic-related materials, including other students' work)  lying    working with others when assignments or exams require individual work    making unauthorized copies of copyrighted material   facilitating or tolerating the dishonesty of others    The Touro College and University System views violation of academic integrity with the utmost gravity. Such violations will lead to appropriate sanctions, from failure in coursework up to and including expulsion from the Touro College and University System. We commit ourselves to the shared vision of academic excellence that can only flourish in a climate of integrity. Academic dishonesty lowers scholastic quality and adversely affects those who will eventually depend on the knowledge and integrity of our graduates. Failure to uphold the principles of academic integrity negatively impacts the reputation of Touro, the value of each and every degree awarded by the institution, and the future success of our graduates.

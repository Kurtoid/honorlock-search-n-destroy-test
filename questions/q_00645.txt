Berkeley Township is located about 100 miles east of Cleveland, Ohio near the Ohio and Pennsylvania border. The Township is a rural community with no access to sewer or water lines. As a result, all of the properties in Berkeley are served by on property septic systems and water wells. The practical realities of this necessitate regulation of property usage to ensure that each property is properly serviced by the septic system and water well as well as prevent pollution due to improper discharge of septic materials (waste water from toilets, showers, laundry, etc.). The Township regulates land use within the Township through its Zoning Resolution. The Resolution is a comprehensive regulatory document that creates specific permitted land uses within regions of the township (creating residential, commercial, industrial, etc. zones), as well as the regulations of land use within the zones (lot coverage, property line setbacks, etc.). The Zoning Resolution is necessary because the harsh soil conditions in Berkeley. The ground is generally hard packed clay which is relatively impervious creating a need for large septic fields. As such, the Resolution mandates large lot zoning in residential areas. Single family homes are required to be on 5 acre minimum lots. The size of a septic field is based on the number of bedrooms in a home because that is correlated to water usage and septic discharge. In an area zoned as Residential, Single Family the Resolution limits homes to single family units and does not permit commercial, business, or other uses. A single family is defined as a unit of people related by blood, marriage, or legal relationship living together in a permanent and/or long term arrangement. The Resolution specifically prohibits multi-family living arrangements as well as uses such as hotels and short term rentals. Short term rentals are defined as "temporary lodging offered to the public for a fee." Berkeley Zoning Resolution. The Berkeley Zoning Resolution is created by the Zoning Commission, a subdivision of the Township government created for the express purpose of drafting the Zoning Resolution. The Zoning Resolution is enforced by the Township Zoning Inspector, Cheryl Hines. As part of her job duties Hines investigates reported violations of the Zoning Resolution, issues notices of violations, and initiates enforcement actions. State law provides a procedure for resolution of zoning violation issues. First, the property owner must appeal the Notice of Violation to the Board of Zoning Appeals, a community member board created to adjudicate zoning disputes. The Board of Zoning Appeals conducts a hearing, takes evidence, examines witnesses, and issues a written opinion on the issue of dispute. The Board of Zoning Appeals can address any issues raised by the property owner or the zoning inspector. An appeal of the Board of Zoning Appeals decision may be made to the County Court of Common Pleas as an administrative appeal. The administrative appeal is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard by the Court of Common Pleas with full appellate rights under the rules of civil and appellate procedure. A property owner found to be in violation of the Resolution is subject to injunctions to prevent future violations, civil damages, and other remedial orders. Sandy Mazzure owns a home in Berkeley Township. Her home is in an area zoned Residential, Single Family Home. Her home sits on 6 acres of land and has a functioning septic system and water well. When the home was built the septic system was designed for a 6-bedroom house but the home only includes 4 bedrooms. Sandy lives in this home with her husband and her three children. In April 2019 Sandy was looking for ways to supplement the family's income. Because Berkeley Township is located near to extensive recreational activities - a large national forest, a pristine lake with fishing, boating and water skiing activities, and a vibrant folk art scene, Sandy determined that renting the family home out to vacationers through an online service would generate substantial income. She listed the home for weekend rentals through the online portal LandRent.com. The home was available for weekend, Friday through Sunday, rentals. On weekends that the home was rented, the Mazzure family would vacate the home on Friday morning and spend the weekend at a local hotel. The renters would leave on Sunday afternoon and the Mazzure family would return on Sunday evening. At no point were the Mazzure family and the renters in the home at the same time. In June 2019, Hines was advised by a concerned citizen that there was unusual traffic at the Mazzure house. The citizen advised that it appeared that people were living in the Mazzure home on the weekends while the Mazzure family lived there during the week. Based on this complain Mazzure conducted an investigation and quickly found the LandRent.com listing for the Mazzure home. Hines used the rental portal to request a quote and availability for August 2-4, 2019 weekend. Sandy Mazzure responded that the home was available for rent at that time and the rate would be $2250.00 for the weekend. Based on this investigation Hines issued a notice of violation of the Zoning Resolution to Sandy Mazzure. This notice advised Mazzure that the use of her property "as temporary lodging offered to the public was not permitted in the Residential, Single Family zoning district and was in violation of the Berkeley Zoning Resolution." The notice advised Mazzure of her right to appeal the notice to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Mazzure appealed the notice to the Board of Zoning Appeals and a full hearing on this matter is scheduled for May 20, 2021. Mazzure is represented by an attorney before the Board of Zoning Appeals and the Zoning Inspector, as the Township representative, is represented by the County Prosecutor. On February 1, 2021, Mazzure filed an original action under Section 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Mazzure named Berkeley Township, Cheryl Hines in her personal and professional capacities, and the Zoning Commission members in their personal and professional capacities as defendants. The case was assigned to Judge Helmick sitting in Toledo, Ohio. Toledo is approximately 100 miles west of Cleveland. Mazzure's complaint alleged that the Zoning Resolution, specifically the prohibition on short-term rentals constituted a Fifth Amendment Takings Clause violation. She asserted that enforcement of the Zoning Resolution would take her private property without payment of just compensation. She sought declaratory judgment as well as a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of the Zoning Resolution. Mazzure also alleged that the Board of Zoning Appeals process would deprive her of due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Additionally, Mazzure alleged that the Zoning Commission members were liable for damages as the exclusion of short-term rentals from the Residential, Single Family zoning district was predicated on personal interest in maintaining the property values of the Zoning Commission members. Mazzure further alleged that Hines's misstated factual issues in the notice of violation causing her emotional distress and damage to her reputation in the community. You represent either the Plaintiff (Mazzure) or the Defendants (all defendants) before the District Court. Before addressing the merits of Mazzure's complaint, Judge Helmick requested briefing on issues of abstention as well as immunity of the Zoning Commission members and Cheryl Hines. Judge Helmick ordered simultaneous briefing, that is both sides briefs are due on Monday, May 10 at 12 p.m. You are to write your brief in support of your position as well as addressing issues to be raised by the other side.

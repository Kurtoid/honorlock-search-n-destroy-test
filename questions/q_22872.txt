Colleges have a serious problem with alcohol abuse among students, and its not getting any better. . . . Binge drinking--defined as the heavy, episodic use of alcohol--has persisted on campuses despite both a general decrease in alcohol consumption among Americans and an increase in the number of abstainers. Some people (including the author of a recent front-page article in The New York Times) have assumed that the latter two trends have translated into more moderate drinking on the campuses. Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Our recent research, which received support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was the only large-scale study to date of the extent and consequences of binge drinking at a representative sample of American colleges and universities. Our detailed findings from surveys of 17,592 students at 140 randomly selected four-year colleges were published in the December 7, 2014, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. . . . Our study found that 44 percent of all students in the sample were binge drinkers--50 percent of the men and 39 percent of the women. from "Too Many Colleges Are Still in Denial about Alcohol Abuse" by Henry Wechsler, Charles Deutsch, and George Dowdall, p. 943 In the first paragraph, why do the authors refer to The New York Times?

In cucumber, fruit color is controlled by one gene with two alleles, symbolized G and g. There are two traits for fruit color: Green fruits and yellow fruits. A series of crosses were done to determine the relationships between the alleles and between the alleles and fruit color. Cross 1:  Both parents have yellow fruits, and all their offspring have yellow fruits. Cross 2:  Both parents have green fruits, and some of their offspring have green fruits and some have yellow fruits. Cross 3:  The male parent has yellow fruits, the female parent has green fruits, and some of their offspring have yellow fruits and others have green fruits. Use the information above to answer the following questions: What is the dominant phenotype? [phenotype1] What is the genotype of the female parent in cross 2? [genotype1] What is the genotype of the male parent in cross 3? [genotype2] In which cross are BOTH parents homozygous? [cross1]

Use functional equivalence partitioning approach to design test cases for this function.  You should have at least three levels of partition.  You must show your partitioning tree. Generate one test case for each leaf node. Note each test case should look like: Case # ((input_data1, input_data2, input_data3), expected output) If a test case is illegal in any sense, state so. Also, list_1 and list_2 should have different contents for different test cases.

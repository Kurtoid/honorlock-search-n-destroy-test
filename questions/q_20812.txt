On January 1, 2054, the stockholders of Mega Man Corp. adopted a stock option plan for top executives whereby each may receive rights to purchase up to 15,000 shares of common stock at $40 per share. The par value is $10 per share. On February 1, 2054, options were granted to each of five executives to purchase 15,000 shares. The options were non-transferable and the executive had to remain an employee of the company to exercise the option. The options expire on February 1, 2056. It is assumed that the options were for services performed equally in 2054 and 2055. The fair value option-pricing model determines total compensation expense to be $3,750,000. On January 1, 2055, one of the executives resigns and their options were terminated as a result. The market price at the time of resignation was $35. On February 1, 2056, three executives exercised their options. The last executive chose not to exercise her options, which were therefore forfeited.

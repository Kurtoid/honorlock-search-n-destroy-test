The study vignette relates to Questions 26-29 In a larger study on quality of assisted living care facilities, a new measurement scale (15 items) is developed to measure "Perceived Quality of Residential Care" (PQRC), to be used with residents in evaluating the extent to which they experience their housing as safe, supportive, strong on health care, and access to social opportunities. To validate the scale, residents from 3 Medicaid funded nursing homes (which have less resources) and an equal number of residents receiving privately funded nursing homes (which have more resources) were surveyed using this new measure. As anticipated, the evaluators found that the private nursing home residents scored significantly higher on most items of the measure. --------------------------------------------------- Based on the information you have, which of the following statements is/are true about the PQRC scale?

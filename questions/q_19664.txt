Benji watched the vegetable plants flower and produce fruit in his father's garden. Soon he became interested in the process of pollination. He read about the process, and then decided to put his thoughts into words. Read the first paragraph of Benji's essay. Then answer the following question(s).       Mutual Benefit     1Plants must reproduce, and by studying those that flower we can learn a lot about how that happens. 2Flowers are actually reproductive organs. 3They are fertilized by pollen. 4Plants with flowers depend mainly on the wind and animals, as does other plants. 5Because they transfer pollen, both wind and animals are considered to be pollinators. 6Everybody knows that two of the primary pollinators are hummingbirds and bees. 7Each work in a different way. 8The way that bees transfer pollen is one of the most interesting. 9As a honeybee collects nectar      from a flower, the pollen from the flower collects in the hair on its hind legs, for example. 10Then, as the bee flies from flower to flower, the pollen is transferred to other flowers. 11But why would a honeybee do this? 12To make flowers reproduce? 13Hardly! 14They do it because they need the nectar. 15Nectar provides the bees with the nutrition it need to survive. 16So, they travel from flower to flower, collecting nectar. 17Later, they will convert the nectar to honey. 18Tracing the entire process from beginning to end reveals fascinating details.

In which sentence does Benji succeed?

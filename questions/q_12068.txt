An audit partner is considering going concern for a client. The client's business has suffered due to COVID 19 lockdowns and general economic conditions in its industry, and analysts believe that the industry will not fully recover for the next 18-24 months. As a result, the client is unable to meet all of its financial obligations, and the future of the company is in doubt. The company has been an audit client for the last six years, and the partner has developed a strong professional and personal relationship with its CEO over this period. The company has received "clean" audit opinions on its financial statements for the past six years. At the end of the current year audit engagement, the partner consulted with the audit firm's quality control partner on the audit about the need to include a going-concern explanatory paragraph in the audit report on the client's current year financial statements. The partner discussed the issue with the client's CEO, who objected and said that a going-concern modification to the audit report would become a "self-fulfilling prophecy" that would ultimately damage the company, leading to its failure and the loss of numerous jobs. The partner is now considering the next steps in the process. Required: Answer the following questions in detail. Be as specific as possible.  What are the audit partner's options at this point? What does the client CEO mean by calling the going concern report modification a "self-fulfilling prophecy"? What are the implications to the audit partner, the audit firm, and the client if the partner decides not to include a going concern modification in this year's audit report? How is the audit partner's relationship with the client CEO relevant to this specific audit judgment issue?

You discover a new G-protein coupled receptor and a ligand for this receptor. You determine that this ligand/receptor pair stimulates Gas leading to cAMP accumulation and PKA activation in HEK-293 cells. You observe that this newly discovered receptor becomes phosphorylated on multiple serine residues in its carboxy-terminal tail. Provide an explanation for this finding and predict what would happen to the magnitude and timing of this receptor's signaling through Gas if you mutated these serine residues to alanines?

Who is the author of this passage?    Sept. 6. These troubles being over, and not all being compact together in one ship, they put to sea again with a prosperous wind. . . yet, according to the usual manner, many were afflicted with seasickness.

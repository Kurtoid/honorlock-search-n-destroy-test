The governmental agency that operates a city's airports institutes a new rule barring "any solicitation of funds in the airport by any individuals or organizations who - in soliciting funds - make negative comments about the city or aims to use their funds to criticize the city." The agency justifies its ban on the grounds that solicitation of funds can interfere with air travelers' ability to board their planes on time - and, although it can address this disruption taken by itself (by encouraging travelers to ignore solicitors), it will not tolerate the additional harm that might be done if solicitors engage in activities that "harm the city's tourism industry by portraying the city in a negative light." How will a court likely rule on the constitutionality of this solicitation ban if it applied existing First Amendment doctrine?

Both Type I and Type II osteogenesis imperfecta can be caused by mutations in the COL1A1 gene. Mutations causing the milder Type I OI are typically null mutations, whereas those causing the perinatal lethal Type II OI are usually missense mutations that allow synthesis of normal amounts of the altered collagen subunit. Which of the following provides the best explanation for the paradoxically greater phenotypic severity of Type II OI?        Type I OI Type II OI   A Reduced amount of procollagen triple helices that are structurally normal Typical amount of procollagen helices;  all are structurally abnormal   B Reduced amount of procollagen triple helices that are structurally normal Typical amount of procollagen helices;  some structurally normal, most abnormal   C Non-functional procollagen double helices  Typical amount of procollagen helices;  all are structurally abnormal   D Non-functional procollagen double helices  Typical amount of procollagen helices;  some structurally normal, most abnormal

Part 1 (25 points) A 12000 kg truck with 0.500 m radius tires travels at 15.0 m/s in a circular track with 200 m radius. A) What is the angular velocity of the rotating tires? (5 points) B) Calculate the centripetal acceleration on the truck. (5 points) C) Calculate the centripetal force on the truck. (5 points) D) Assuming an unbanked curve, find the static coefficient of friction, between the tires and the road, static friction being the reason that keeps the truck from slipping.

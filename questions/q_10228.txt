Consider the formation reaction shown using the metal Snapeium (symbol Sp) and monodentate ligand L: Sp+(aq)  + [n] L (aq)  SpL[n]+ (aq)  A solution initially has concentrations of Sp+ = 0.1[a]0 M and L = 0.[b] M. When concentrations become constant the concentration of SpL[n]+ was found to be 0.0[c]0 M.       Calculate the formation constant, Kf. You must show work for full credit in your upload.

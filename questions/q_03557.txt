5.  In the movie The Monolith Monsters, an asteroid crashes on Earth. When it rains, black rectangular slabs grow up from the ground, but when the rain stops, growth stops.  When the slabs get very tall, they topple over and shatter.  When it rains again, each shard begins growing into a new slab; consequently, over time, slabs spread out over an increasingly larger area.  If you touch a slab, your hand turns white, and you die.

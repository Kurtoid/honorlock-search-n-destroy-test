Buyer is a regular attendee at garage sales in her town. While attending a sale at the home of Seller, Buyer sees a rather dull and dirty landscape painting in a rather gaudy modern frame. Buyer, who thinks that the colors in the painting would go well in her living room (once the thing is cleaned up) offers $50, and after some negotiation she and Seller agree to a sale at $85. The painting is subsequently proved to be a lost painting by American luminist artist Sanford Robinson Gifford (1823-1880). The Sotheby's auction house appraises the painting at $100,000 to $130,000. At no time prior to the sale was Buyer aware that the painting was a Gifford. Immediately upon learning of the identification, Seller sues to rescind the contract.  (a) What are Seller's arguments that the contract should, in fact, be rescinded? (b) What are Buyer's arguments that the contract should be left as is?  Be sure to indicate in your answer which party's arguments you find to be stronger and why.

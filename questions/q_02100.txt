A kitchen design firm builds cabinets on a make-to-order basis for new-home construction. Both holding inventory and backorders are allowed. In June 2018, production was 360 cabinets and there is currently a backorder of 100 cabinets. The demand for July through December of 2018 is shown in the table below. The cost of increasing cabinet production (hiring extra carpenters, etc.) from one month to the next is $528 per cabinet, the cost of reducing cabinet production (layoff expenses, etc.) is $417 per cabinet, the cost of holding a cabinet in inventory is $384 per cabinet, and the cost of backordering a cabinet is $254 per cabinet. The number of cabinets in inventory at the end of December must be 0. The number of backordered cabinets may never decrease by more than 10% from one month to the next, and the number of backordered cabinets at the end of December must be 0. Build a linear programming model for the aggregate plan that will minimize the sum of backorder costs + inventory costs + production increase costs + production decrease costs for the six-month planning period.

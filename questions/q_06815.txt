The b-cells of the pancreas do not have a transporter for fructose. We know that the b-cells secrete insulin when glucose levels are high in part due to the import of glucose by the b-cell GLUT2 transporter. The imported glucose is metabolized to yield ATP which is the signal for insulin to be released by the b-cell. Among other effects, insulin directly activates the feeling of satiety (the feeling of having eaten enough, of being full). Therefore, a diet of HFCS may result in which of the following?

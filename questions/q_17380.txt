In the game Demolition Drake: Duck Squad, consider the AI agent, Sargent Snipe, moving in a 2D continuous space via steering behaviors. Sargent Snipe is currently at position (20.0, -10.0) m and traveling at her maximum speed with velocity (0.0, 5.0) m/s. In the current simulation frame, a Shrike Ray (collectable super weapon) randomly appears at position (15.0, -10) m. Sargent Snipe wants the Shrike Ray and immediately begins moving towards it at maximum acceleration (5 m/s2). She will continue to maximally accelerate (with velocity clamped to maximum speed) towards the Shrike Ray until it is collected. The collider radii of Sargent Snipe and the Shrike Ray are both 0.25 m, and a contact between the two colliders will register as a pick-up. The game simulation runs at 60 Hz. At what simulation time (in seconds) will Sargent Snipe collect the Shrike Ray? For this scenario, the moment the Shrike Ray appears is at time 0 s.

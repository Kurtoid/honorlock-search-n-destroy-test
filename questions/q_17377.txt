The standard mergesort algorithm we have seen works on inputs which use an array data structure. It is also possible to implement mergesort using linked lists - we will do part of this. Implement a method called merge that takes the heads of two singly linked sorted lists in as arguments, and produces a new sorted list created from merging the contents of both into the sorted order. Both the input and merged result will have the smallest element at the head. Example: Let s1 = (head) [1, 2, 3, 8] and s2 = (head) [4, 5, 6, 7], which produces result = (head) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. If needed, emptying the input lists is fine. A sample implementation for a node of a singly linked list is given below - your method must be in terms of it. public class IntNode { private IntNode next; private final int x; public IntNode(int x) { next = null; this.x = x; } public IntNode getNext() { return next; } public void setNext(IntNode node) { next = node; } public T getX() { return x; } } public static IntNode merge(IntNode headA, IntNode headB) { //TODO: write this code!

Considering the below chart, label the three trends of device failure rate based on the following descriptions: PCB - A printed circuit board suffers a brief wear in period followed by an extended period with a relatively constant failure rate as well as some wear out near the end of "life" due to environmental exposure SOFTWARE - A software program does not suffer wear out and use does not substantial contribute to failure rate; however, most failures occur due to "bugs" built-in to the software at the start of life PUMP - A mechanical pump is sold by a manufacturer that conducts burn-in tests at the factory before delivery to customers; however, failure mechanisms for the pump include part fatigue and corrosion (draw the failure rate from the customer's perspective)    Curve "a" = [Curve_a] Curve "b" = [Curve_b] Curve "c" = [Curve_c]

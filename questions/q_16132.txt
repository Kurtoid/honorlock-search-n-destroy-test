Short answer questions, write answers on blank paper. 1. (5 points) A plot of enzyme activity with and without an inhibitor present gave the following plot.    Without the inhibitor, what are the values of Vmax and Km? In the presence of the inhibitor, which of these items has changed and what is(are) the new value(s)? What type of inhibitor is present (explain why you have arrived at this conclusion)? Be sure to include units as necessary--answers that do not contain required units will be marked incorrect.  2. (4 points) The following curve shows typical hemoglobin-oxygen binding.  Draw this curve on your paper and properly label your axes, specifically the 100% degree of saturation on the y-axis. Draw and clearly label curves for hemoglobin-oxygen binding following (1) increased CO2 and (2) removal of 2,3-BPG.   3. (5 points) When ATP transfers a phosphate to another molecule, it often first transfers a phosphate to histidine, then leaves as ADP. Using the following structure of ATP (ADP with a phosphate on it), show the reaction with histidine and the resulting phosphohistidine intermediate.     Immediately before submitting your quiz, you must show your short answer section to your camera. We need to be able to clearly see your work so hold it about 12-18 inches away from your camera and slowly move your paper to capture the entire page. If you have multiple pages, make sure to show all pages. Please only show your short answer section, do not show scratch paper used for the multiple choice questions.

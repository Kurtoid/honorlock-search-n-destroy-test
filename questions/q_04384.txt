We are considering entering a derivatives transaction with a new counterparty. We believe that this company could potentially default at three times during the 3-year life of the proposed deal. The estimated probabilities of default are 1.9% at the end of year one, 2.2% at the end of year two, and 2.7% at the end of year three. We expect the value of the deal to be -$2.3 million (minus 2.3 million) at the end of year one, $1.9 million (positive 1.9 million) at the end of year two, and $3.8 million (positive 3.8 million) at the end of year three. We estimate the recovery rate to be 38%. If interest rates are assumed to be 3% compounded continuously, what is your estimate of this transaction's credit value adjustment (CVA)?

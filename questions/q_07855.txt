A transformer that is [L] cm long, [W] cm wide, and [H] cm high is to be cooled by attaching a [L]-cm x [W]-cm-wide polished aluminum heat sink (emissivity = [e]) to its top surface. The heat sink has [n] fins, which are [hf] cm high, [t] cm thick, and [L] cm long. A fan blows air at [Tinf]degC parallel to the passages between the fins. The heat sink is to dissipate [Qdot] W of heat and the base temperature of the heat sink is not to exceed [Ts]degC. Assuming the fins and the base plate to be nearly isothermal and the radiation heat transfer to be negligible, determine  thee heat transfer coefficient the minimum freestream velocity the fan needs to supply to avoid overheating. (use the box below to answer this part)  Assume the flow is laminar over the entire finned surface of the transformer.    Show all your work on the work upload (assumptions, schematics, analysis, etc.) document. Write down units in your equations. Solve symbolically and plug in numbers at the end.

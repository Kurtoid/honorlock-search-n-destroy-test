Use the picture, variables, and problem setup from here to answer this and the following three questions. The answer to part a is the answer to this question. The following parts are answered in questions 22 and 23. A solenoid of length  = [L] m, radius  = [R] cm, and total of number of wire turns  = [N] creates a field of magnitude  = [B] mT in the z-direction at its center.   (7 pts) What is the current in this solenoid? (7 pts, Q22) If we double , , , and , what would be the new field at the center? (7 pts, Q23) If we went back to the original values of , , and , choose ONE LOOP a distance  = [a] cm away from the center (the one shown in red in this image) and find its contribution to the field at the origin when carrying the current calculated in part a. Give the direction consistent with the coordinate system as well.  Enter the original current in the solenoid (part a) in units of A.

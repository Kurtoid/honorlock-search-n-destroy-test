Amy was born in Korea and spent the first year of her life with a Korean foster family. Birth records indicated a normal, full-term delivery. An American family adopted Amy when she was 14 months of age. Amy walked at 14 months, was toilet trained at 4 to 5 years of age, and had few words at 3 years of age. At 30 months of age, a bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss was identified. Audiologic records indicated that the loss was progressive in nature. At the time of her first evaluation, Amy's hearing loss was borderline normal sloping to profound bilaterally. Her family met with the audiologist and you are the Early Intervention SLP that has been assigned to her case. The parents are confused about what the audiogram means. Explain her audiogram to her family. Write this as a script of what you would say to them. Include the impacts of this hearing loss on speech and language development without amplification. What amplification options based on only her audiometry does she have at this point in time with this audiogram?

Answer the multiple-choice questions over this conditional proof. Keep in mind that on the exam, you would have to construct the whole proof on your own. Use the html box in "Bonus" question 1 to write out the steps to the proof so you can refer back to it when answering the multiple-choice questions.   Note: To show indenting, I put "in 1", "in 2", "in 3" (So indenting three times). Then to step out (discharging the assumption), I put "out 3", "out 2", "out 1". That way we don't need to worry about moving lines in or trying to tab.   Line 14 should be this using line 13 and what rule?

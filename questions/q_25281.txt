The following is an assessment done on your patient. He underwent abdominal surgery 2 days ago and has been on morphine for pain.  Because of his surgery he has been non-ambulatory since.  He had been lethargic from the pain medicine so the physician lessened the morphine dose this morning.  Currently, his RR is 28 and shallow.  His SpO2 has dropped from 98% on 2 l/m NC to 90%.  A CXR has been obtained and it shows slight elevation of both hemidiaphragms and some opacities in the bases.  His BS are diminished in the bases.

You prepare bacterial cell extracts by lysing the cells and removing insoluble debris via centrifugation. These extracts provide the proteins required for DNA replication. Your DNA template is a small, double-stranded circular piece of DNA (a plasmid) with a single origin of replication and a single replication termination site. The termination site is on the opposite side of the plasmid from the origin. Figure 6-11      You decide to use different bacterial strains (each having one protein of the replication machinery mutated) in order to examine the role of individual proteins in the normal process of DNA replication.   QUESTION: What part of the DNA replication process would be most directly affected if a strain of bacteria lacking primase were used to make the cell extracts?

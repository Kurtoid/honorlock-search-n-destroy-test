The following question refers to this scenario. Two experienced railroad foremen died after entering a railroad tank car that had been involved in a derailment at another location. Both victims worked for a company that specialized in refurbishing and repairing railroad equipment. The empty railroad tank car had been filled with soybean oil, and the headspace (unfilled volume) inside the tank car was filled with a cover gas (in this case nitrogen) to prevent spoilage. At the time of the incident, the tank car did not have any permanent or temporary exterior warning signs or markings to alert workers that a hazardous atmosphere was present. The first victim was attempting to assess the extent of repairs from inside the tank car. He used a portable multi-gas meter to measure the air quality inside the car and reported to a co-worker accompanying him (attendant) that the air inside was okay. He then entered the tank car through the top hatch, while the attendant stayed just outside. Noticing the victim collapse a short time later, the attendant called 911 and radio-ed for help from the company. While emergency help (the confined space rescue crew) was en route (on the way), a second foreman (second victim) arrived at the scene. The second victim immediately asked the attendant about the air quality inside the tank car and was told by the attendant that the air inside was okay. The second victim then entered the tank car. Once inside the car, the second victim almost immediately collapsed. Emergency personnel arrived moments later. They first checked the air inside the tank car with their equipment and found little or no oxygen inside. Then rescuers donned appropriate respiratory protection and extracted both men, who had died from asphyxiation. In your judgement, in which of these steps was the first safety mistake made in this scenario?
A new breed of cattle called the Beefers has been discovered in Europe and an effort to bring them to the U.S. has been halted because of certain livestock diseases that are found in that country. A producer has decided to create the breed by purchasing semen and trying to develop the breed through grading up. The objective is to create animals that can be registered as purebreds with a new breed association. Indicate which animals are considered foundation animals and which can be registered. Use the following chart to show how this producer can perform this task. Assume the following:    One of the problems that you have in this breed development is that the females that you are using are homozygous for spots (SS) and you don't want the Beefers breed (ss) to have this gene in the population. You have learned that the gene for spots is dominant (S_). The only females you have to use are homozygous Spot females. Assume 100% conception each breeding, and you will get 50% males and 50% females exactly. Use as many females as possible in each mating. 200 Spot females (SS) will be used to start the process.

A graph of the electric field between two capacitor plates as a function of distance from the left plate is shown below. The distance between the plates is  d , the direction of the field is to the right, and a battery is connected to the plates.    1. Are the inserted slabs insulators, conductors, or dielectrics? 2. Which plate carries a positive charge? 3. How many slabs of material have been inserted between the plates? What is the thickness of the material in terms of d? 4. Sketch a graph of the electric field between the plates when the slabs between the plates are removed and the battery remains connected. Does the magnitude of the electric field change?

Pretend you are the Python interpreter and evaluate the expression below. Write down the value and data type that each evaluates to. If your answer is a string include quotes around your answer (i.e "hello"). If your answer is a float make sure you include the decimal (i.e 5.0). Write the word error in both fields if the expression causes an error.  {[ 1, 2, 3 ]: "f"}  Resulting Value of Expression: [value5] Data Type of Expression: [type5]
For a repeated-measures study comparing three treatment conditions with a sample of 4 participants, the participant totals (the P values) are 3, 6, 9, and 6, and the SS values within each treatment are SS1 = 2, SS2 = 2 and SS3 = 6.  What is the value for SSerror?

Problem #3 (25 points): For the Quantum Well below: L=60 A, and Ee1=20meV, Ee2=70meV, Eh1=10meV, Eh2=30meV are relative to their respective band edges.  Also Eg=0.8eV, mn = 0.052m0 and mh = 0.46m0.     A) Calculate the Density of States for the conduction band inside the well for the energy 10meV above Ee1. Give your answer in units of (# states)/(eV*cm2). B) Calculate the Density of States for the conduction band inside the well for the energy 80meV above Ee1. Give your answer in units of (# states)/(eV*cm2). C) If the electron fermi energy is 30meV above Ee1, calculate the total electron carrier density. Give your answer in units of # electrons/cm2.

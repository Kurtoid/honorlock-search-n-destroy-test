A 46-year-old male patient (IBW = 85 kg) who was injured in a motor vehicle crash has been receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for 24 hours. The patient is awake, alert, and looks comfortable on the following settings: VC-IMV with pressure support of 5 cm H2O; set rate = 8 breaths/min; set VT = 500 mL; FIO2 = 0.4; PEEP = 5 cm H2O. A 10-minute spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yields this information: f = 30 breaths/min, RSBI = 145, P0.1 = 10 cm H2O.

SCENARIO 4: Dr. Knowitall is concerned about possible pathologies affecting the patient, but he only knows the common terms for them and is getting them confused. You assist him by identifying the following pertinent pathologies and their meaning:
4. Briefly discuss applications of piezoelectric sensors (with diagrams): i) in traffic monitoring and ii) as a SAW (Surface Acoustic Wave) filter. Determine the force that is being applied to a 1cm x 1cm x 0.1cm quartz crystal if a voltage of 50volts is detected. The modulus of elasticity and the piezoelectric coefficient of quartz are 1.04x107 psi and 2.3x10-12 m/V respectively.
Ohm's law: Calculate the current through a 10.0-m long 22 gauge (having radius 0.321 mm) nichrome wire if it is connected to a 12.0-V battery. The resistivity of nichrome is 100 x 10-8 O [?] m.
I can earn bonus points toward my Chapter Assignments grade by completing the Chapter Discussion Boards. The original response to the discussion boards for each unit is due the day before each unit testing window begins. My response to a classmate's post for each unit's discussion boards is due the final day of the testing window. There are definite due dates for Discussion Boards and NO late submissions are accepted for any reason.

The image below illustrates directional terms utilized to describe locations on and movements of the human body. Match the numbers to the terms that best represent them.
Describe Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)   what are its functions?  what are its locations? how is it formed?
From what you learned in NS2002, match the listed areas to the description that fits best. NOTE! Not all listed areas can be matched. Tip: Take attention to what is described: (cerebral) cortex area - brain areas that makes up the surface of the brain brainstem area - everything that is located somewhere within the brainstem upper motor control - Everything that must send signals to local circuits to control movements. lower motor control (local circuits is the same thing) - located in the spinal cord or brainstem and make up the necessary final step because only they contain motor neurons the axons of which make synapses with muscle fibers.

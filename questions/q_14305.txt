Your cousin Vinny is a third-year dental student and he joined a research group interested in determining whiteness in teeth. Unfortunately, no one in his dental group knows how to conduct a study. So your cousin asks you to help them investigate three popular teeth whitening brands: (A1) Crest 3D White Strips, (A2) Rembrandt 2-Hour Whitening, and (A3) Opulence PF Teeth Whitening. Four clinical dentists will serve as judges and rate tooth color on a whiteness scale (range: zero - 100; dull gray to brilliant white) before and after treatments. Vinny's dental group would like you to plan and conduct the study, compute the appropriate statistical analyses, interpret the findings, and draw valid conclusions.        (a) List three steps involved in conducting this study including the experimental design, variability concerns, and statistical analysis.

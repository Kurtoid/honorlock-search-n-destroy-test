You are performing a carotid artery Doppler exam on a 75 year old male patient.  The right common carotid artery has a clinically significant stenosis.  You obtain Doppler information on the blood flow in the vessel before the stenosis, within the stenosis, and after the stenosis.   (A) How will the blood flow velocity and pressure be affected in the stenosis? (B) What physics principle explains the relationship between blood velocity and pressure? (C) When will turbulent flow be detected and how will this appear on your spectral Doppler display?

This question is extra credit. Be sure to answer the entire question for full credit. Origins-of-life researchers have hypothesized that a chemical reaction called phosphorylation may have been crucial for the assembly of three key ingredients in early life forms. What phosphorylating agent that was plausibly present on early Earth and could have produced these three classes of molecules side-by-side under the same realistic conditions was discovered in the article, Potential 'missing link' in chemistry that led to life on Earth discovered? (You can use the acronym)   What are the 3 classes of molecules that are able to be formed with this compound?

On September 30, 2005, Dart Co.'s bank statement showed a balance of $8,510.  When preparing the bank reconciliation it was determined that a deposit of $1,900 had been mailed to the bank by Dart Co. on September 29 and was not included in the September 30 bank statement.  It was further determined that $1,125 of outstanding checks had not been included in the September 30 bank statement.  Assuming that the bank had not made an error, what would be the Adjusted Balance for this bank reconciliation for the bank statement section?

Use the table below to answer the following question(s) using the standard Solver.A company makes standard 130-inch-wide rolls of thin sheet metal and slits them into smaller rolls to meet customer orders for widths of 10, 14, and 25 inches. Suppose that the company has proposed the following cutting patterns:      A B C D E   1 Cutting-Stock Problem           2             3 Data           4 Pattern 10-in rolls 14-in. rolls 25-in. rolls Scrap   5 1 0 8 0 10   6 2 0 2 3 10   7 3 3 0 3 4   8 4 10 0 0 10   9 5 3 2 2 4   10 6 8 2 0 4    Demands for the coming week are 950 10-inch rolls, 725 14-inch roles, and 640 25-inch rolls. Develop a model using the Analytic Solver Platform that will determine how many 130-inch rolls to cut into each of the six patterns in order to meet demand and minimize scrap.What is the total number of 14-inch rolls produced?

Block A of mass 5.0 kg and block X are attached to a rope which passes over a pulley, as shown in the figure. An 80-N force P is applied horizontally to block A, keeping it in contact with a rough vertical face. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the wall and block A are " role="presentation">ms = 0.40 and " role="presentation">mk = 0.30. The pulley is light and frictionless. The mass of block X is adjusted until block A moves upward with an acceleration of 1.6 m/s2. What is the mass of block X?

Later that day, we learned that it only takes 55 minutes to walk around the entire island, so the bus tour was a waste of time and money.The last day wasn't so bad. We saw a lot of birds and took hundreds of photos. We also found a restaurant where the food was great. We looked for souvenirs at the one store in town, but we didn't buy anything.

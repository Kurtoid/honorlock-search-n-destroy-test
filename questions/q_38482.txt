Carnosine (shown below) is a dipeptide molecule made up of the amino acids b-alanine and histidine bound together through an amide bond. It is highly concentrated in muscle and brain tissues and has been proven to scavenge reactive oxygen species, among other things.  Consider the different conformations of carnosine through the C2-C3 bond and answer the following questions. Which of the Newman structures below represents the conformation wherein the dihedral angle between the "Im" group and the "NH(b-Ala)" group is 180deg? [180deg] Which of the Newman structures below represents the conformation wherein the dihedral angle between the "Im" group and the "NH(b-Ala)" group is 0deg?

Palindrome word is a word that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam. Identify and fix all the mistakes in the following code snippet that counts the number of words in a sentence which are palindrome. For example, 'the radar shows rain at noon' has 2 words that are palindrome. You cannot add whole new lines of code. To write your response, mention the line number followed by the incorrect code in the line and then the correct code. For example: Line 2: for ii=1:1:5 should be for ii=2:1:10 (this is just an example!).    n = input('Enter the string: '); n(length(n)+1) = '   '; s = 1; count = 0; for ii = 1:1:length(n)         if isspace(n(ii)) == 0          if n(s:1:ii) == n(ii:-1:s)              count = count+1;           end           s = ii;        end  end fprintf('The number of palindrome numbers is %d', s)

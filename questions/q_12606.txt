This water pipe on a table top has a circular cross section, but it tapers from diameter [dd] m at point S to smaller diameter 0.0050 m at point B. The speed of water flow at point S is vS = 3.0 m/s, and the water pressure is 1.4 atmospheres.    Use this information, the continuity equation and the Bernoulli equation to calculate the speed of the water flow at point B. Type in your answer to the nearest 0.1 m/s of flow speed.  E.g., if your answer is 11.287 m/s, then type 11.3 in the answer box.

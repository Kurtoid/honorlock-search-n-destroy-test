Coal gas is produced at a gasworks. Pollutants in the gas are removed by scrubbers, which become less and less efficient as time goes on. The following measurements, made twice each month, show the rate at which pollutants are escaping (in tons/month) in the gas.

(b) Write an integral that represents the exact amount of pollutants (in tons) that escape during the three-month time period. (Do not evaluate this integral)

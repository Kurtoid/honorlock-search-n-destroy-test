A nutrition store in the mall is selling an herbal supplement intended to improve memory. To test the effectiveness (i.e., the influence on memory) of the herbal mixture, a skeptical researcher obtains a sample of n = 36 people and requests that each person take the suggested dosage each day for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4-week period, each individual takes a standardized memory test (large numbers indicate better memory). The scores from the sample produced a mean of M = 32. In the general population, the standardized memory test is known to have a mean of u = 30 and s = 6. Do the sample data support the conclusion that the herbal supplement improved memory? To answer this question, go through the 7 steps for hypothesis testing and use a = .05 (critical value = +-1.65). SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. 1) IV(s) and DV(s) and the number of tails: 2) State Hypotheses: 3) Describe where the critical region(s) would be on a distribution. 4) Calculate the z-score for the sample mean (if possible bold, underline, or indicate your final answer). 5) Decision: 6) Effect size: 7) Plain English interpretation and APA statistical information:

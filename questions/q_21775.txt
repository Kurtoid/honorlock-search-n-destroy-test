Instructions: The paragraphs of the following essay have been scrambled so that they are out of order. Read them and then answer the questions that follow. Evaluating a Web Site               (1) Next, find out more about the person or people who created the web site. (2) Scroll down to the bottom of the page to look for the author's name, or click on links such as "About Us," "Biography," or "Who Am I?" (3) These links will usually lead to more information about the individual or organization responsible. (4) Look for details about the author's credentials. (5) Is he or she an expert, with education, training, or experience in the subject matter? (6) If no information about the site's creator is provided or if that person offers no proof of authority, the information may not be reliable. (7) Remember that anyone can create an Internet web site; therefore, researchers should verify that the person who posted the information knows what he or she is talking about.               (8) First, begin by examining the URL, or Internet address, of the web site. (9) In particular, examine the last three letters of the address, which reveal the domain of a site as an educational institution, government agency, nonprofit organization, or commercial company. (10) Usually, the first three types of domains, which end in .edu, .gov, .mil, .us, and .org, tend to be reliable sources of information. (11) The primary purpose of sites that end in .com, on the other hand, may be to persuade viewers to buy something rather than provide them with accurate, unbiased information. (12) A .com web site could also be someone's personal web site, which may or may not offer reliable information.               (13) Using this procedure helps researchers get their facts straight. (14) Mining the Internet for information will almost always produce gold, but finding that gold often requires sifting through and discarding worthless rocks.               (15) Finally, in addition to finding out more about the site's creator, look for a few other indicators of quality information. (16) The date the page was last updated, for example, should be fairly recent. (17) In addition, note whether the author mentions the sources of his or her information. (18) Sources that are documented with footnotes or links, especially if they refer to scholarly or academic journals and books, are usually more reputable. (19) Also, don't forget to notice the overall look of the site. (20) Is the page crowded with advertisements? (21) If so, its main purpose may be selling rather than informing. (22) Is the text filled with grammatical or spelling errors? (23) These kinds of mistakes may indicate untrustworthy information.               (24) The Internet offers millions of web sites; however, they're not all created equal.  (25) Some of them contain accurate information, and some contain only opinions, inaccurate information, or information that's been manipulated in some way. (26) Therefore, people who use a search engine to look for web sites about a particular topic need to know how to distinguish a credible web site from a dud. (27) To evaluate the trustworthiness of a web site, online researchers can use a three-step procedure. In the reordered sequence, select the number of the topic sentence in the second paragraph.

A structure consists of springs with following stiffnesses: k1 = 105 N/m k2 = 2 x 105 N/m k3 = 3 x 105 N/m The springs are connected in series as shown in the figure below.  The ends of the system are fixed and an axial load of magnitude 1000 N is applied at node 2 as shown in the figure.      Write the stiffness matrices for each of the elements Using the assembly of elements, formulate the stiffness matrix of the structure WITHOUT CONSTRAINTS. Write the stiffness matrix of the CONSTRAINED structure with boundary conditions applied as indicated. Determine the displacement of node 2 and node 3?  (5-Points Each)

Extra credit 1: Which type of crystal is observed in the microscope found in the scaly leaves of an onion bulb?
Alma Home Products designs, manufactures and sells home cleaning products.  Alma creates trademarks to enhance the marketing of its products and many of the trademarks are illustrations that are intended to create familiarity with their products.  Alma began marketing a new line of garbage bags called "Fresh-scent" and it put a symbol on each garbage bag and on the box in which it sells the garbage bags that was identical to the "f" symbol used by Facebook (the well-known social media site and app).  The symbol (which is a registered trademark of Facebook) is familiar to all of us:                              Facebook has sued Alma alleging trademark infringement under the Trademark Dilution Revision Act which modified the Lanham Act.  Alma believes it has done nothing wrong because it and Facebook conduct business in completely different markets - home cleaning products versus social media - so there can't be any confusion in the marketplace.   Which of the following answers is correct?
Which of the following statements is true regarding depreciation methods?

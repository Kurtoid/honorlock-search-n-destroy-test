Please label your answers with the appropriate letter for each part of the question. (a) Under what circumstances do attitudes not predict behavior (2 pts)? (b) Describe a classic research study testing how well people's reported attitudes aligned with or matched their later behavior (2 pts).  (c) In class, we learned about 4 factors that you need to account for when trying to understand how attitudes and behavior correlate. Explain 2 of these (2 pts each). (d) List the term for or describe when behaviors predict our attitudes (1 pt). (e) Once we experience this type of mismatch between our behavior and our attitudes, how are we most likely to resolve that mismatch (1 pt)?

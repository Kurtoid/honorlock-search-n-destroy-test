Tanya and Sue are enrolled in a Biology 1406 course at Texas University. They are studying for an upcoming lab exam. Sue has purchased a lot of alcohol and has consumed about 3 cans of beer per hour. They have been studying for three hours. As Sue watches her friend consume large amounts of alcohol despite her warning, she decides to do her research project on the effects of alcohol consumption on student performance on exams. Tanya has seen many students consume large amounts of alcohol while studying for an exam and wonders if there is a correlation between the amount of alcohol consumed and exam performance. Which of the following would be a good hypothesis ?
Penicillium Eukaryote or prokaryote

Question 13:  The function  models the average time, , in hours that a new production team takes to assemble one TV where t is the number of days of training the team received. The graph of this function is shown below.      a) Use the graph to obtain a reasonable estimate of the average time it would take a production team to assemble one TV if the team received 3 days of training.   b) Using the graph, after how many days of training (or no training at all) is the length of time to assemble one TV the greatest?   c) Use the function's equation to determine how many hours it would take a production team to assemble a TV if they had 5 days of training. Round to the nearest tenth.   d) The asymptote of the function represents the time a production team takes to assemble one TV as the number of days of training increases. What is the equation of the horizontal asymptote associated with this function? Express as an equation.

Lol this really made me smile. (Written by Jason in your class!)  Cpt. Picard wonders about the courtship rituals of the Romulans. He assembles an away team with Lt. Cmdr. Data and Lt. Worf to beam down to the planet Romulus, cleverly disguised as Romulans themselves, to learn more about their courtship rituals. Knowing that Vulcans and Romulans share a common ancestry, he contacts Ambassador Spock on the Planet Vulcan and asks whether the Vulcans and Romulans share the mating ritual of Pon Farr. Spock advises Picard that they do not and that the best way to study the Romulans would be to simply observe and record their behavior. What type of research is Spock suggesting to Picard?

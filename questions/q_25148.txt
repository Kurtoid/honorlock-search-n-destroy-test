I promised you a question that was identically the same as on the sample questions; well, here is another! (I am definitely a nice guy, right?? :) ). The figure shows the demand curve for visits to the only health club in town. Assume that everyone has this same demand curve. Suppose the club's marginal cost curve is as shown in the figure. The health club knows this is the demand curve for its services and also knows its marginal cost curve. If the club hires you as a consultant, what price or pricing scheme would you suggest to the owners to maximize their profit?

A student releases a ball from a height of 100 cm above the ground. The ball bounces to a height of 80 cm. The diagram below shows the ball's position at five different times from its starting point to its maximum height after the first bounce. Use the diagram to address the questions below.  A. Explain why the ball has kinetic energy at positions 2 and 4. B. Describe the energy transformation that occurs from position 1 to position 2 and from position 4 to position 5. C. As the ball falls from position 1 to position 3, determine the height at which the ball has approximately equal amounts of kinetic energy and potential energy. Include units in your answer. D. Why doesn't the ball bounce back to the original position of 100 cm? Relate this to the Law of Conservation of Energy.

In a hypothetical situation, a certain species of flea feeds only on pronghorn antelopes. In the western United States, pronghorns and cattle often associate with one another in the same open rangeland. Some of these fleas develop a strong preference for cattle blood and mate only with other fleas that prefer cattle blood. The host mammal can be considered as the fleas' habitat. If this situation persists, and new species evolve, this would be an example of ________.

I certify that I understand that I am not allowed to use any outside help, I am not allowed to use my cellphone or hand held calculator.  I am not allowed to use any notes, books, hand outs or any other type of assistance.  I certify that I have performed a FULL 360 degree view of my surrounding space including the space on the surface around my lap/top or computer and I realize that if I must move to another seat I will need to perform the 360 scan again.  I certify that I have shown the front and back of my scratch paper (only 1 paper is allowed) I understand that any non adherence with this will result in a 0 on the exam and a possible write up for academic dishonesty which can lead up to termination from the nursing program.

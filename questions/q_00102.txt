After years of work for corporations, the firm decided that ERISA was no longer profitable and instead it believe that such practice brought much malpractice risk to the firm.  Thus, the firm informed the five ERISA lawyers that they were being fired.

All ERISA clients were informed about this decision and all of them chose to transfer all of the client files of past and present cases to the new small firm.

Use the following two half reactions using the fake metal element Koalum (Km) in this problem Km2+(aq) + 2 e-   Km(s)           Eo = 0.39 V Km(OH)2(s) + 2 e-  Km(s) + 2 OH- (aq)         Eo = 0.11 V Calculate the equilibrium constant for the following reaction: Km(OH)2(s)   Km2+(aq) + 2 OH- (aq).  The standard cell potential for this reaction = [a] V Then calculate the equilibrium constant = [b] You must USE E format for K, no units! Show your work on the uploaded pdf for full credit. Use correct sig figs. Don't round until the end.

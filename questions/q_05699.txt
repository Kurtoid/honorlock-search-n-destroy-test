Write a function named repeat_letter that takes a string and a character as parameters and that returns a new string obtained by replacing every instance of the character with two copies of that character. For example, repeat_letter("banana", 'n') should return the string bannanna. Below are more sample calls:    Function Call Value Returned   repeat_letter("odegaard", 'a') "odegaaaard"   repeat_letter("BAZ", 's') "baz"   repeat_letter("misIsippi", 'i') "miisiisiippii"   repeat_letter("caRRy", 'c') "ccarry"   repeat_letter("JUGLE", 'u') "juugle"   repeat_letter("little", 'l') "llittlle"   repeat_letter("oOps", 'o') "oooops"   repeat_letter("fObAr", 'o') "foobar"   repeat_letter("applep", 'p') "apppplepp"   repeat_letter("rrr", 'r') "rrrrrr"   repeat_letter("theses", 'r') "theses"   repeat_letter("") ""    You should double both lowercase and uppercase versions of the passed in character and always output the result in lowercase. Notice that the function might be passed an empty string, in which case it should return an empty string. You may not alter the string passed to your function. It is fine if you allocate more space for your string than you end up needing as long as other functions can tell where your string data ends.

Robots will probably never... Robot Teachers  If you think of the jobs robots could never do, you would probably put doctors and teachers at the top of the list. It's easy to imagine robot cleaners and factory workers, but some jobs need human connection and creativity. But are we underestimating what robots can do? In some cases, they already perform better than doctors at diagnosing illness. Also, some patients might feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than a person. Could there be a place for robots in education after all?  British education expert Anthony Seldon thinks so. And he even has a date for the robot takeover of the classroom: 2027. He predicts robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be like assistants. Intelligent robots will read students' faces, movements and maybe even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It's not a popular opinion and it's unlikely robots will ever have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans like another human can.   One thing is certain, though. A robot teacher is better than no teacher at all. In some parts of the world, there aren't enough teachers and 9-16 percent of children under the age of 14 don't go to school. That problem could be partly solved by robots because they can teach anywhere and won't get stressed, or tired, or move somewhere for an easier, higher-paid job.   Those negative aspects of teaching are something everyone agrees on. Teachers all over the world are leaving because it is a difficult job and they feel overworked. Perhaps the question is not 'Will robots replace teachers?' but 'How can robots help teachers?' Office workers can use software to do things like organize and answer emails, arrange meetings and update calendars. Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could cut the time teachers spend marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for the parts of the job humans do best.
A husband and wife have a combined income of $80,000. They attended 10 performances of opera in the previous year, and this number just exactly matched their individual demands for opera. Ignoring ticket prices, if their joint income rose to $100,000 and the husband and the wife individually based their demands for opera on their joint income, how many operas could they agree to attend if the husband's income elasticity of demand for opera is 2 and the wife's income elasticity of demand for opera is 0.5? (HINT: Both have to want to attend the opera for them to agree to go, and obviously you cannot attend a fraction of an opera.)

In the United States, an average of seventy-three people are killed by lightning strikes every year, but there are many things you can do to protect yourself. Indoors, the leading cause of lightning injury is from landline telephones, since the electrical charge can travel a long distance through telephone wires.  So get off the phone, and stay away from major appliances, because metal pipes, electrical wires, and dryer vents can all conduct current into the home.  Don't take a bath or shower.  Water conducts electricity particularly well.  Being outdoors is much more dangerous than being indoors.  Swimming is a bad idea. You never want to be the tallest object in the area, or directly underneath the tallest object.  Don't take shelter under a tall tree, or in a small structure such as those on golf courses or near athletic fields. They will protect against wind and rain but not against lightning. Take precautions even when the storm seems safely far away, as lightning can travel as far as ten  miles, and a strike can come out of a clear blue sky. If your hair starts to stand on end in a thunderstorm, this is a bad sign, as it could mean positive charges are rising through you, seeking the negative charge in the air. Move quickly to a safe place!     Which of the following sentences is the main ide?

In addition, it should have the following public methods:   A one-argument constructor that takes a value for the maximum number of movies, initializes the array to the proper size, and initializes the number of movies to zero.  Getters (no setters!) for the maximum number of movies and the actual number of movies.  A void member function called addMovie that takes a Movie, stores it in the next open spot in the array, and increments the number of movies. This should throw a TooManyMoviesException if the array is full (assume that the TooManyMoviesException class has already been defined).  A void member function called display that displays each movie in the collection on a separate line.

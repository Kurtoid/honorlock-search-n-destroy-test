10.  Examine the diagram below.  This diagram shows a small segment of DNA at which the two "parental" (original, template) DNA polynucleotide strands have been separated.  These strands are labeled "upper parental/template strand" and "lower parental/template strand".  An origin of replication is on the left-hand side of the diagram and is indicated by arrows.  The hatched boxes are primers.  I have lettered (in red) each primer "W", "X", Y", or "Z" for reference.  Lastly, I have indicated the 3' and 5' ends of the parental (original, template) DNA and of the primers.        a.  Which parental strand, the "upper strand" or the "lower strand", will serve as the template for the leading strand during DNA replication?  How do you know?  (2.5)      b.  From which end of the primer labeled "X" will replication occur?  In which direction "left-to-right" or "right-to-left", will replication occur from the primer labeled "X"?  (2.5)

A woman accused comedian Aziz Ansari of sexual misconduct after a date in 2018. This is an account from Aziz:  In September of last year, I met a woman at a party. We exchanged numbers. We texted back and forth and eventually went on a date. We went out to dinner, and afterwards we ended up engaging in sexual activity, which by all indications was completely consensual. The next day, I got a text from her saying that although "it may have seemed okay," upon further reflection, she felt uncomfortable. It was true that everything did seem okay to me, so when I heard that it was not the case for her, I was surprised and concerned. I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said. I continue to support the movement that is happening in our culture. It is necessary and long overdue. Evaluate this account by first identifying and describing what type of account this is (be specific). Then argue whether this could have been better by identifying and describing another account OR that it could have been worse by identifying and describing another account.

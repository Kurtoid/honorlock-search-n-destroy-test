Question 1 Consider the following sequence: 11 ; 7 ; 3 ; -1 ; - 5 ; ...    1.1  If this pattern continues consistently, determine the   term of the sequence.  (3)   1.2  Show that - 293 is a term of the sequence.  (2)    1.3   Using the given sequence above, a new sequence is formed as follows: The first term is the same as the first term of the given sequence. The second term equals the sum of the first 2 terms of the given sequence. The third term is the sum of the first 3 terms of the given sequence. The fourth term is the sum of the first 4 terms of the given sequence and so on. Write down the first 4 terms of the new sequence.

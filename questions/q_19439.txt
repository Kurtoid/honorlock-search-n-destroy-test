Long pipes in industrial facilities can undergo significant thermal expansion, especially when they carry hot fluids/gases. Valves and gauges placed at the end of a pipe should have enough clearance from any nearby objects (e.g., the wall of the building) to ensure no collisions occur.  Typical steels used for these pipes have a thermal expansion coefficient of about 10 ppm/degC.  Assuming at an installed temperature of 25 degC a pipe is 100 m long, how much could the pipe expand in total if it operates up to a temperature of 125 degC?

In the course of studying plant communities living on an elevational gradient in Rocky Mountain National Park, researchers observed that a plant species growing in the park appears to actually be three species. The low elevation (LE) species is more clearly distinct from the high elevation (HE) species, but the middle elevation (ME) species has characteristics of both. After taking seeds from all three populations back to their greenhouse for a reproductive study, the researchers discovered that ME plants could not successfully pollinate HE plants, but ME did produce sterile seeds with the LE plants. Which statement best describes the reproductive isolating mechanisms between these populations?

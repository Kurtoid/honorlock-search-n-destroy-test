Use the standard reduction potential data in the table below to answer the question:     Calculate the standard cell potential for the following galvanic cell: Cr(s) | Cr3+(aq) || Fe2+(aq) | Fe(s)   Standard cell potential (Edeg{"version":"1.1","math":"deg"}cell) is calculated with the following equation:   Edeg{"version":"1.1","math":"deg"}cell = Edeg{"version":"1.1","math":"deg"}cathode - Edeg{"version":"1.1","math":"deg"}anode -OR- Edeg{"version":"1.1","math":"deg"}cell = Edeg{"version":"1.1","math":"deg"}reduction + Edeg{"version":"1.1","math":"deg"}oxidation   (Hint: remember that the voltages listed in the reference table are reduction potentials; oxidation potentials for the reverse half-reactions would have the opposite sign.)

Article I of the Texas Constitution discusses the _________________.
When 2-bromo-2-methylbutane is treated with a base, a mixture of 2-methyl-2-butene and 2-methyl-1-butene is produced when potassium hydroxide is the base, 2-methyl-1-butene accounts for 45% of the product mixture. However, when potassium tert-butoxide is the base, 2-methyl-1-butene accounts for 70% of the product mixture. What percent of 2-methyl-1-butene would be in the mixture if potassium propoxide were the base?

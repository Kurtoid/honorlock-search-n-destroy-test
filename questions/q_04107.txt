FULL SOLUTION PROBLEM:  Answer the question here (enter the answers in the text box), but you must submit a full solution including Given, Find, EQU, all mathematical steps, and include units.  Work on this problem should be submitted to the Test #3 work submission link on Canvas Text #3 Module no more than 15 minutes after the completion of this Quiz.   A spring/block system is kept in a vertical orientation as shown in the figure.  At the beginning, the spring is squeezed and the system is at rest. When the system is released the block start moving up with an acceleration. Take d = 4.60 cm, m = 1.70 kg and k = 1050 N/m. Take gravitational and spring potential energy as zero for y = 0. Answer the following questions. A) Find the speed of the block when the spring has returned to its equilibrium position. B) Find the maximum height (in m) the block reaches from y=0 position on the scale. C) Determine the value of y (in cm) for which the kinetic energy of the system is a maximum.

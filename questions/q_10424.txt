On June 27th last year, a crew of five workers began partial demolition of an abandoned city hall building in Belfry, Kentucky.  One truck driver who hauled the debris to the dump, four workers who helped the driver haul and dump the debris, and two people who had washed the building assisted them.  At the time of demolition, a colony of bats had been observed in the vicinity of the building, and an approximately 2-foot deep pile of debris covered with bat guano had accumulated in the building.  During demolition, none of the workers wore personal protective equipment (i.e. respirators, eye protection, gloves, or protective clothing).  Within 3 weeks, six of these workers required treatment for acute respiratory illnesses, and three had been hospitalized.  Their symptoms included chills, fever, cough, and headache.  Several had substernal discomfort.  Crackles were heard in the lungs upon auscultation.

All of the men recovered without complications after receiving the anti-fungal medication amphotericin B.  Which is the most likely causative agent?

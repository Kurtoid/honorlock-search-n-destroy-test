Fertile Ground The nitrogen cycle describes the fluxes of nitrogen atoms among air, land, and water. Nitrogen enters the atmosphere in the form of N2O or N2 gas when people burn fossil fuels. Nitrogen enters soil as bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen to NO3-, which can be absorbed by plants. Water contacting soil will pick up nitrogen and carry it to a lake or ocean. In recent decades, the use of fertilizers containing nitrogen has increased the amount of nitrogen that flows into lakes and oceans, causing blooms of algal referred to as eutrophication.    Use this information and your knowledge about biology to answer questions 16-20.   16. All of the nitrogen in fertilizers will end up in bodies of water.

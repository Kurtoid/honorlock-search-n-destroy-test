The diagrams above depict rigid containers composed of two aqueous chambers, A and B, each containing an Na+ solution and separated by a Na+ permeable membrane. The panel on the left represents the distribution of Na+ ions at rest in the absence of any electrical potential. In this scenario, the concentration of Na+ ions in chamber A equals the concentration of Na+ ions in chamber B. The panel on the right illustrates the effect of a +60-millivolt potential applied across the membrane (chamber B relative to chamber A). Assuming a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, which of the following expressions best describes the resulting distribution of x ions between the two chambers?

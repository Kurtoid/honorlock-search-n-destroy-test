THIS QUESTION IS EXTRA CREDIT   Two water storage tanks are separated by a fluid control gate (supported at pin joint H). The intended purpose of the gate is to allow water to move between the tanks if the water level difference becomes too large. The interface between the top and bottom of the gate is smooth and frictionless, but would allow water to move across the tanks if the gate rotated away from the position shown. The gate extends into the page a distance of 1 m and is a distance of L high. If the depth z2 is never less than the height of the gate, L, what is the largest depth z1 allowable before the control gate will begin to leak and pass water across the boundary? Neglect the width of the gate in this problem for simplicity.

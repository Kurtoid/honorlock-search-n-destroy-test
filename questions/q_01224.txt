Upload your work when you are finished with the exam. The reaction shown below is at equilibrium. PeO4(g)  +  2 N2(g)  =  PeN2(g)  +  2 NO2(g)      Kp = 6.48 x 10-5 a.  Write the equilibrium expression for Kp for this reaction on your paper.  You do not need to type anything into Canvas for part a. b.  A flask is filled with 0.341 atm of PeO4 and 0.379 atm of N2.  Determine the partial pressures of PeN2 and NO2 at equilibrium.  You may assume that the change in concentration is very small relative to the starting pressures. partial pressure PeN2 [PeN2] partial pressure NO2 [NO2]

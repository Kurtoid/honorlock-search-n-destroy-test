The Department of Transportation would like to test the hypothesis that the average age of cars on the road is greater than or equal to 12 years.  A random sample of 45 cars had an average age of 10.6 years.  It is believed that the population standard deviation for the age of cars is 4.1 years.  The Department of Transportation would like to set a=0.05. What is the conclusion of the hypothesis test?

Paul uses the analogy of a Roman soldier's uniform to depict  spiritual ________ in his letter to the Ephesians.
In an experiment, we mixed a halogen with a halide. The halogen is a diatomic molecule, with a preference for the solvent, hexane. The halide is a single anion, with a preference for the solvent, water. When we mix a halogen, a halide (in aqueous solution), and hexane together, we can determine whether a reaction occurred or not by observing the hexane layer. In order to do this, we establish a color chart by mixing each halogen with hexane and note the color that is present. All halides are colorless and in aqueous solution to begin with. In hexane:A2 is blueB2 is greenC2 is redD2 is yellow{"version":"1.1","math":"In hexane:A2 is blueB2 is greenC2 is redD2 is yellow"} 1) When A2 is mixed with C-, the hexane layer appears to be blue. Did a reaction occur? 2) When A2 is mixed with D-, the hexane layer appears to be yellow. Did a reaction occur? (yes or no) 3) When X2 reacts with Y- (different set) a reaction does occur. Write the balanced net ionic equation for this reaction.

Mechanics of Breathing Hybrid. Use the answer bank below and type in a letter only, nothing else. Answers can be used more than once. While not breathing the pressure inside the lungs is equal to the pressure in the [1](1). In order for resting inspiration to occur the [2](2) muscle contracts leading to a [3](3) in the volume of the lungs  which leads to a [4](4: A or B) in the pressure  of the lungs.  Now the pressure in the atmosphere is [5](5: O or P) than the pressure in the lungs and this leads to air flowing [6](6: Q or R) the lungs. In order for forced or active expiration to occur the [7](7: choose any expiratory muscle) muscle  contracts leading to a [8](8: A or B) in the volume of the lungs  which leads to a [9](9: A or B) in the pressure  of the lungs.  Now the pressure in the atmosphere is [10](10: O or P) than the pressure in the lungs and this leads to air flowing [11](11: Q or R) the lungs. These changes in pressure and volume are all happening according to [12] (12: a gas law) law.     A. Increase   E. Diaphragm   I. Sternocleidomastoid   M. Boyle's   Q. Into     B. Decrease   F.

Problem 4c) FSM combinatorial part ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner. The tool bar has indent functions.  In problem 4c) write the Combinatorial code for this FSM using the state transition table defined below continuing the code from 4a) and 4b) A state transition table (which contains the same information as a state diagram) is supplied, below. This should be done by instantiating the 4:1 multiplexer from problem 1 caseMUX41 for nextstate and for Z. For maximum credit your code should carefully follow the specification, and your grade will depend that. Use the minimum number of lines to accomplish this specification. Use System Verilog, always_ff, and always_comb, and don't use reg datatype. Also use proper indentation for organization.   ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate

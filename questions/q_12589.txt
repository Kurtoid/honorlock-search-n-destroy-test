A distribution of point charges is placed on the coordinate system shown below. The axis is marked in meters. Assume the potential infinitely far from the origin is zero.   a) Calculate the electric potential due to the distribution of charges at point P, which is located at the origin. b) Find the electric potential at r= 8mi+4mj (8m, 4m) labeled as P' in the figure. c) A charge qc = -1.965x10-3 C is placed at the origin and is moved infinitely far away. What is the change in potential energy for qc. d) First of all, qc is removed from the origin. Then a charge of qd=8.65x10-7 C is placed at P'. What is the change in potential energy in moving this charge to the origin? part a) 3. Find the contribution to the electric potential from charge q1 at the origin. Write your answer in scientific notation, and enter the coefficient, rounding to 3 decimal places. Do not include units, and put a minus sign if negative.. V1 =         x107 V

Your patient is a 21-year-old football player who was struck in the lateral aspect of the left knee by another player's shoulder. The patient is in extreme pain, and the knee is significantly deformed and swollen. The pedal pulse is weak, but present, and capillary refill is less than 2 seconds. The patient is screaming at you to "fix" his knee. You are 10 minutes from the emergency department. You should:

Johnny's Shop-and-Pay is a regional grocery chain, and their marketing manager is trying to determine the profit-maximizing coupon program for the store's laundry detergent brand.  Coupon users at the store have an elasticity of demand for this product that equals -3, and the elasticity of demand for non-users of the coupon for the store brand equals -1.5.  If the full retail (undiscounted) price of the detergent is $10 per box, what is the optimal discount to provide for coupon users?

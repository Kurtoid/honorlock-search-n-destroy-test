You will write a  SIX Paragraph Argument Essay:  Obviously, most people wouldn't think to deny any child, regardless of his/her nationality, the opportunity to have a loving home. However, as you can see from these articles, there are opponents of international adoptions who feel strongly that a child should not be adopted by someone of a different nationality even if that means that the child remains in the foster care system.  Which side of the argument do you agree with and why?  Discuss your views with relevant examples and support from the articles. Make sure that you have clear plan/strategy about the development of your essay and STICK TO IT. You do not need to submit an outline, BUT you should create one on your scrap paper to help you with the organization of your ideas as you will be graded on organization. No matter which topic or style you choose, it should be crystal clear to your audience. (It does not have to be true; it just has to be realistic, structurally correct - according to the criteria and examples we discussed in class - and don't forget creative!) Since you do not have access to the articles, the Internet, or the dictionary; it should be evident that you are not being graded on content. HOWEVER, your arguments should still be reasonable and logical. You can make up statistical data or even quotes as long as whatever you write is BELIEVABLE. No matter what, you need to give a thorough defense of your argument.

Tu dudas que nosotros _______ (terminar) la tarea a tiempo, pero yo no.
Question 2 - Spreadsheets     A spreadsheet is used to administer the results of your school's athletics day.     Open the 2Results spreadsheet and work in the Times worksheet.     2.1   Change the formatting as follows:         2.1.1   Change the width of column A to 12.   (1)     2.1.2   Format cells A1: F2 to look like in the example (do not change any colors): Right click: Open in new tab - to see the example:     (2)     2.2   Find the chart on the Times worksheet. Modify the graph to look similar to the example in the spreadsheet by following the instructions below.  Do the following:  Remove the vertical axis. Add the title 'Event' for the horizontal axis. Display the graph's legend at the top. Add data labels for all the columns. Fill the background with the picture 2Olympics and set the transparency to 10%. Make sure each data series is displayed in a different color.    (6)     2.3   The function in cell G8 is supposed to calculate the average points total of the athletes who participated, but there is something wrong with the function.  Correct the error in the function. Also use a function to round off the answer so that the answer appears as 4.13.    (3)     2.4   The points total for track items are stored in columns B and C and the points for field items in Columns D-F. Insert a formula in cell G10 to determine how many more points were awarded for track items than for field items.   (3)      Work in the Javelin worksheet.         2.5   Use the Subtotal function to determine the highest distance in each grade.   (3)         Work in the Participants worksheet.         2.6   An attempt was made to calculate the number of athletes who participated in javelin throwing in cell M7. The wrong result is given. Correct the function in cell M7 so that it displays the correct answer.   (1)     2.7   Use the existing function in cell M10 to create a formula to calculate the percentage of athletes who have a fine (column G). Format the answer as a percentage.   (4)     2.8   Insert a function in cell M17 to calculate the third lowest 'Points Score' (column I)   (3)     2.9   Insert a function in cell L22 to calculate the total of the Grade 10 learners' fines. The function must work when copied to cells M22: N22 to calculate the fines of the Grade 11 and 12 learners correctly.   (5)     2.10   Athletes whose distance is 40 or higher are eligible to participate in a lucky draw. Insert a function in cell N24 to generate a random number from 1 to the number of athletes eligible for the lucky draw.   (5)     2.11   Insert a function in cell N27 to determine how many Team leaders have fines. Clue: Follow the 'building blocks' approach using the blank columns to the right of the worksheet as follows: Step 1:                Insert a counting function in the blank column P to determine if the athlete is a 'Team Leader'. Step 2:    Insert a count function in the blank column Q to determine if the athlete has a fine. Step 3:    Insert a formula or a function in the blank column R to determine if the learner is a 'team leader' and has a fine. Step 4:  Insert a function in cell N27, using the results of Step 3, to display the answer   (4)         Save the 2Results spreadsheet and SAVE it on your computer as MS Excel (.xlsx) file.   [40]

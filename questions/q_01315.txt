DIRECTIONS: Read the passage. Complete the notes using words from the reading.Aiming High [A] Yuri Gagarin had worked hard all of his life. He had often told himself that one day his efforts would lead to something special. Sitting in a spacecraft, minutes away from being rocketed miles above the Earth, he realized that he would soon have the most special experience anyone could imagine. Yuri Gagarin was about to become the first man to visit space. [B] Gagarin was born on March 9, 1934 in the Soviet Union (present-day Russia). He grew up in a very ordinary family. His father was a carpenter,1 and his mother was a milkmaid.2 The young Gagarin, however, had bigger dreams. He studied very hard in his early school days and received scholarships to study at a technological academy.[C] Gagarin's real intention, however, was to become a pilot. While he was studying at the academy, he volunteered as a junior member of a local flying club. Eventually, after countless weekends, he learned to fly. Because of his incredible focus and attention to detail, he became a very good pilot. [D] For other young Soviet men, being called into the national armed forces was a scary moment. This was not the case for Gagarin. This was because it gave him the chance to improve his piloting skills as a member of the air force. Gagarin did more than simply improve. Over time, associates in the air force considered him to be one of the best pilots in the entire country.[E] When the Soviet Union commenced its space program in the late 1950s, Gagarin was included in a list of 20 possible astronauts for the country's, and the world's, first space flight. Those in senior positions at the space program admired Gagarin for the incredible amount of work he did in training. Psychologists3 also perceived that he had the right state of mind to be sent into space. As a result, Gagarin was chosen for the mission.[F] When his Vostok spacecraft lifted off on April 12, 1961, Gagarin could not hide his excitement. Although he did not usually speak in an informal way, he shouted "Poyekhali!" ("Let's go!") as the rocket sent him into space. After making one full orbit4 of the Earth, Gagarin landed safely and immediately became a hero in his country. Sadly, Gagarin died in a plane crash in March 1968. However, more than 50 years after his flight to space, people around the world still admire him for his bravery.1 A carpenter is someone who makes things from wood.2 A milkmaid is a term used in the past to describe a woman who gets milk from cows on a farm. 3 A psychologist is someone who studies the human mind. 4 An orbit is the path taken by an object around another object in space. Gagarin's mother worked as a ____________________.

Suppose that a decision maker faced with four decision alternatives and five states of nature develops the following profit payoff table:     s1 s2 s3 s4 s5   d1 11 13 8 15 20   d2 14 20 13 6 17   d3 7 16 18 13 11   d4 19 10 11 21 7    If the prior probabilities for the five states of nature are p(s1) = 0.1, p(s2) = 0.3, p(s3) = 0.3, p(s4) = 0.2, and p(s5) = 0.1, then what is the expected value of perfect information.

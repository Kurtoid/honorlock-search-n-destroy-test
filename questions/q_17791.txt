An 18-year-old boy with Kallmann syndrome enters your clinic.... Discuss his symptoms and the mechanism of why they are occurring (focusing on the GnRH neuron). You decide to treat this patient with GnRH. Discuss how GnRH must be administered (dose, frequency, route). After a month of GnRH treatment, you decide to assay for testosterone. Describe how this hormone assay would be conducted.

4. Decision Trees (12 points)  We have used a greedy one-step lookahead for growing decision trees: we pick a new node to add by looking at the remaining attributes and choosing the one with the greatest information gain. Let's call Gain(a,d) the information gain function, where a is an attribute and d our data set. Imagine that we instead used a two-step lookahead. Rather than pick a single node to add to our tree we are allowed to choose a node and its children simultaneously. We define a new information gain measure, Gain2(a,l,r,d), that computes the information gain of the attribute combined with the information gain of the best children that could follow it. In other words, we find a, l, and r that maximize Gain2(a,l,r,d) = Gain(a,d) + Gain(l,pos(d,a)) + Gain(r,neg(d,a)). Here pos(d,a) and neg(d,a) return the subset of data in d where attribute a is positive and negative, respectively, and Gain2 is reasonably defined when a, l, r and/or d are empty. This defines a mini tree (much like class Hs2 except that the children of a maybe different) that we then add to our decision tree. (a) Is this a richer hypothesis class? Why or why not? (b) What are some advantages and disadvantages of this alternate approach? Clearly mark your answers with (a) and (b).

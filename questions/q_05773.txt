A group of students has been trained to increase their score on the math segment of the S.A.T.  For the general population, S.A.T.-Math scores are distributed N (495,105). It is reasonable to assume that the shape of the distribution is unchanged by training effects, but is shifted, hopefully to the right. It follows that we assume that s =105. For a random sample, of size n = 100 the sample mean (Ms) S.A.T.-math score is 519.    Test  Ho: =495  vs. Ha: >495 at the a =.05 level of significance. The following triple (z-score, p-value, Your Conclusion) is produced when the data is properly input into your calculator

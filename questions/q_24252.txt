Air traffic controllers have the crucial task of ensuring that aircraft don't collide. To do this, they must quickly discern when two planes are about to enter the same air space at the same time. They are aided by video display panels that track the aircraft in their sector and alert the controller when two flight paths are about to converge. The display panel currently in use has a mean "alert time" of 15 seconds. (The alert time is the time elapsing between the instant when two aircraft enter into a collision course and when a controller initiates a call to reroute the planes.) According to Ralph Rudd, a supervisor of air traffic controllers at the Greater Cincinnati International Airport, a new display panel has been developed that uses artificial intelligence to project a plane's current flight path into the future. This new panel provides air traffic controllers with an earlier warning that a collision is likely. It is hoped that the mean "alert time," m, for the new panel is less than 8 seconds. In order to test the new panel, 15 randomly selected air traffic controllers are trained to use the panel and their alert times for a simulated collision course are recorded. The sample alert times (in seconds) are: 7.2, 7.5, 8.0, 6.8, 7.2, 8.4, 5.3, 7.3, 7.6, 7.1, 9.4, 6.4, 7.9, 6.2, 8.7. Hint: Formulas below remind you how to calculate confidence interval. You need to plug in some of the numbers in the Excel output to do the calculation for Q3.    This is output by Excel. Using the output to answer the following questions.    Q1: What is the point estimation of the population mean alert time? Q2: What is the level of significance? (Hint: a) Q3: Please find the confidence interval for the population mean alert time, m, for the new panel. (Please show your work and round your answers to 3 decimal places.)

Suzanne received 20 ISOs (each option gives her the right to purchase 20 shares of stock for $12 per share) at the time she started working when the stock price was $13 per share. Three years later, when the share price was $23 per share, she exercised all of her options. If Suzanne holds the shares for two additional years and sells them when the market price is $30, how much gain will Suzanne recognize on the sale and how much tax will she pay assuming her marginal tax rate is 37 percent and her preferential tax rate is 20%?

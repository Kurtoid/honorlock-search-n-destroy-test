An 80-year-old male who has been a long-term nursing home resident with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was admitted to the hospital by his primary care physician with shortness of breath, elevated white blood count, and bibasilar infiltrates. A pulmonary disease consultant agreed with the attending physician that the patient had aspiration pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, both present on admission. In addition, the pulmonologist describes the man's COPD as obstructive chronic bronchitis. The patient had an Advance Directive that indicated he did not want to be placed on a ventilator. Intravenous antibiotics were administered, and the patient agreed to be placed on intermittent positive airway pressure breathing for 48 hours. Fortunately, appropriate treatment was able to control the conditions quickly, and the patient was taken to a skilled nursing facility for extended recovery from the aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. Given the patient had symptoms of three conditions ( chronic lung disease, aspiration pneumonia, and respiratory failure) all present on admission, and any could have been the reason after study for the admission to the hospital, the coder asked the attending physician's assistance in identifying the principal diagnosis as determined by the circumstances of admission, the diagnostic workup, and therapy provided. The physician chose the aspiration pneumonia as patient's principal diagnosis, as it was one of the main reasons for the admission and required the greatest intensity of care and use of resources. According to the physician, the respiratory failure was suspected to have resulted from either the aspiration pneumonia or the worsening chronic lung disease affected by the aspiration pneumonia.

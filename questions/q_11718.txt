Review the following example of the Elicit-Provide-Elicit Technique: Patient: I think I'm going to try a juice cleanse diet for two weeks to lose this extra 10 pounds I can't seem to shed. My friend saw a documentary that said it's a great, healthy way to lose stubborn weight quickly. Counselor: I can see that you're determined to continue your weight loss journey and try new things to reach your health goals. Why do you think a juice cleanse would be a good idea for you? Patient: Well, I don't know much about the details, but I keep hearing that fruit and vegetable juices are really healthy, and they help you lose weight when you've hit a plateau. I have been eating well and working out for almost a year, and I've been losing weight steadily. I'm so close to my goal, but I just can't seem to shake these last ten pounds! I feel like my body needs something different. Counselor: It sounds like you are frustrated with how your progress has slowed recently and you want to try something a bit more drastic to see a bigger result. But, in my professional opinion, you have been doing all the right things to lose weight, and a juice cleanse is probably not necessary for you. While it is true that a lot of people lose some weight initially, they often gain it back again as soon as they return to solid foods. Juice cleanses are not sustainable, they don't provide all the essential nutrients, and you will likely not see any lasting benefits from trying one. What are your thoughts now? What are 2 things the counselor should have done differently?

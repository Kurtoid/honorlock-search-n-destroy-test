You are a dairy farmer and interested in boosting milk production from your herd of 1000 milk-producing cows. You classify your cows as low, and high milk producers based on monthly records that you've kept over the last 10 months. You decide to genotype all of them, and find the following haplotypes on 1 mega-base regions on three different chromosomes that appear to be significant in terms of milk production in your stock.                   A            C             T         T     haplotype 1 Chr1 ____________________________                  G            C             A         G    haplotype 2                C               A         A        haplotype 3 Chr5_______________________                C               G         C        haplotype 4                             C     T                haplotype 5 Chr 18_____________________                            A     A                haplotype 6 You find that all of the low milk producers have haplotype 2, 3 and 5 on Chromosomes 1, 5 and 18. 60% of the high milk producers have haplotypes 1, 3 and 6 and the other 40% have haplotypes 1, 4 and 5. Which 1 mega-base region(s) would you sequence to find the genes involved in milk production?

A crucible is placed on a balance and is found to have a mass of 26.639 grams a sample of Na2SO4*xH2O is added to the crucible and the total mass is found to be 27.085 grams. The crucible is then placed on a ring stand and gently heated to remove to remove the bound water molecules. The final mass after heating was found to be 26.915 grams. What is the value for x in Na2SO4*xH2O?

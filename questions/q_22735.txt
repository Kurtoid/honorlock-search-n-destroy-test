It looks like goodwill, but it is really a money-making trade because the business gets profit and a good name, too. Which side of the argument do you agree with?  Discuss your views with relevant examples and support. *You have the option of which essay to write, but I believe that the argument essay is the easiest in this situation.* Make sure that you have clear plan/strategy about the development of your essay and STICK TO IT.

Since you do not have access to the articles, the Internet, or the dictionary; it should be evident that you are not being graded on content. HOWEVER, your arguments should still be reasonable and logical. You can make up statistical data or even quotes as long as whatever you write is BELIEVABLE. No matter what, you need to give a thorough defense of your argument.

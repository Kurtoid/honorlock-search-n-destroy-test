VRAAG  5         TEKS 5                       "OUERS DREIG MET REGSTAPPE NA BAKLEIERY MET ONNIE."         Robin het nie sy huiswerk gedoen nie. Die onderwyseres ruk die boek uit sy hand en vra hard: "Wat gaan jou verskoning vandag wees?" Hy laat sy pen val omdat hy so bang is en die ink maak 'n merk op die onderwyseres se rok. Hy moet voor die hele klas verskoning vra. Sy ouers weier; Robin is al genoeg verneder en sy ouers dreig met regstappe. Sy straf is toe om 'n opstel te skryf. Ek sal graag die opstel wil lees om Robin se kant van die saak te hoor!         Ons weet almal dat dit vandag nie (speel) is om skool te hou nie. In party skole is daar totale anargie. Kinders leer van (kind+regte), dat dit onderwysers teen die mure wil (uitdryf/uitdruif). Wat dit nog moeiliker maak, is dat ouers hul "onskuldige bloedjies" ten volle ondersteun.         Om dissipline in die skool te behou, moet daar ook gesag in die ouerhuis wees. Dit is elke ouer se plig om (elke dag) gesag oor hulle kinders uit te oefen en om hulle maniere te leer en om ander te respekteer. 181 woorde [Brief verwerk en aangepas uit Die Burger, 20 Augustus 2008]

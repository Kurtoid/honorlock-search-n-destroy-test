A patient's arterial blood gas results are pH = 7.30; PCO2 = 40; HCO3 = 19 mEq/L; PO2 = 80. What would be an appropriate nursing diagnosis for the patient?
Question #1 on the exam will be a link to the periodic table sheets.  Click on link to open the sheets. Do not write an answer for this question.  The exam will tell you that you have missed answering 1 question - ignore it.   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wH2hYr7MAJyRv4HGxA5Ek6PI5N-VOSkJ/view To toggle between the exam and the periodic table sheets, CTRL key 1 to open exam page, CTRL 2 to open periodic table pages.      The exam will tell you that you have forgotten to answer question #1.  Please ignore the alert.  Question #1 is worth 0 points. Go to questions 14-21 the SHOW WORK problems FIRST and do those problems first because you can get partial credit.

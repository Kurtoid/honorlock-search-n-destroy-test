For Questions 17-20, consider the following situation: Alcohol abuse researchers wanted to determine if the number of alcoholic drinks per week drunk by a successful college student had any impact on his/her studies (and in particular, on his/her GPA).  Sixty graduating seniors were selected at random and asked what their GPA was and how many drinks they had, per week, throughout their college career.  Here are the results of the analysis of the least squares regression line for this data:      The regression equation is:                                           GPA = 3.45140 - 0.0592606 DRINKS                                                                                S = 0.386810      R2 = 31.8 %      R2 (adj) = 30.6 %    How would we interpret the slope of this equation?     For each one additional drink per week, the student's GPA should increase by .059     points, on average. For each one additional drink per week, the student's GPA should decrease by .059 points, on average. For each 3.45 additional drinks per week, the student's GPA should decrease by .059 points, on average It is inappropriate to interpret the slope for this equation, since R2 is so small.

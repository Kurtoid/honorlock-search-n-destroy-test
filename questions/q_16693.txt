You've been a teacher, so you can imagine what it does to students when they have no food to eat for an entire day. The school day here at Fremont is eight hours long."From:Kozol, Jonathan. The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America. Crown Publishing Group, 2005. The passage appears on page 176.

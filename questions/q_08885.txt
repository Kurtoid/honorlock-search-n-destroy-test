Your girlfriend just won the Florida lottery. She has the choice of $15,900,000 today or a [t]-year annuity of $1,050,000, with the first payment coming one year from today. What rate of return is built into the annuity? Disregard taxes.   Think about it. Given that she can choose between these two options, we can assume that the price (present value) of the 20-year annuity is $15,900,000 (hence, this is the PV), 20 is the number of years (N), $1,050,000 is the yearly payment and there is no future value (it is zero). **Round your answer to the nearest three decimals if needed. Do not type the % symbol. Type your solution as a percentage and not as a decimal (i.e. 4.2 and not 0.042).

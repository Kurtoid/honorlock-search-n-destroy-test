In a hypothetical scenario, imagine that you have discovered a rare species of bird on a remote Pacific island. You spend some time studying their ecology and habitation and discover that although these birds look alike, they are indeed two distinct populations with very different mating calls.

A girl causes a merry-go-round, which is is initially at rest, to start turning by pulling with a force F=110 N while running on the ground at its edge. She pulls either by grabbing a railing at the edge (a distance R=1.80 m from the center) and pulling sideways, or by grabbing a railing closer the the merry-go-round's center (a distance 3R/4 from the center) and pulling at an angle of th=50deg to the radial direction. Assume the merry-go-round is a uniform solid disk with mass M =155 kg. a) What is the magnitude of the torque applied to the merry-go-round by the girl when she pulls on the outer railing? b) What is the magnitude of the torque applied to the merry-go-round by the girl when she pulls on the inner railing? c) What is the angular acceleration of the merry-go-round when the girl pulls on the outer railing? d) What is the final angular velocity of the merry-go-round after the girl pulls on the outer railing for 5.50 s? e) What is the final angular momentum of the merry-go-round after the girl pulls on the outer railing for 5.50 s?

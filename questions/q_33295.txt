Boxcar interactions You observe three boxcars interact in a freight yard outside Kansas City.    Boxcar X initially has speed [vv] m/s as it moves to the right toward the other two boxcars.  Its mass is [mx] kg. The other two boxcars, U and H, are hooked together and initially at rest, and they are loaded identically, each with mass [mg] kg.  Boxcar X slams into the boxcar U, latches to U, and the three boxcars move off together, to the right at a new speed, vnew. Calculate the new speed, vnew. Type in the numeric part of your answer to the nearest 0.01 m/s of rightward speed.  E.g., if your new speed is 22.387 m/s, then type 22.39 in the answer box.

Chapter 6 The MS-DRG payment includes reimbursement for all the following inpatient services except:
A variable force of magnitude F(x) moves a body of mass m along the x-axis from x1 to x2. The net work done by the force in moving the body from x1 to x2 is  where v1 and v2 are the body's velocities at  x1 and x2. Knowing that the work done by the force equals the change in the body's kinetic energy, solve the problem.A 2-oz tennis ball was served at 80 ft/sec about (55 mph). How much work was done on the ball to make it go this fast? (To find the ball's mass from its weight, express the weight in pounds and divide by  the acceleration of gravity.)

Consider two receptors, one inhibitory and one activating, on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells: KIR receptors that interact with certain class I MHC proteins, and special Fc receptors that recognize the tail region of IgG antibodies. When NK cells are incubated with an immortalized (i.e. cancerous) B cell line derived by infection of human B cells with Epstein-Barr Virus, the B cells are killed by NK cells. Normal B cells, by contrast, are not efficiently killed by NK cells. In each of the following scenarios, indicate whether the described changes are expected to enhance, suppress or have no effect on the cytotoxicity (killing activity) of the NK cells in this system. Match the prompt with one of these choices. Some may be used more than once or not at all.

A local hardware store claims that the mean waiting time in line is less than 3.5 minutes. A random sample of 20 customers has a mean of 3.2 minutes with a standard deviation of 0.8 minute. If a = 0.10, test the store's claim. H0:  = 3.5 Ha:  [response1]  Test statistic: [response2] p-Value = [response3] Decision: [response4] Conclusion: There is [response5] sufficient evidence to make the conclusion that the mean waiting time at this hardware store is less than 3.5 minutes.

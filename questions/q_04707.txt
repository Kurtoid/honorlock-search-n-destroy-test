The figure below represents the frequency of the D1 allele in a population of fruit flies raised under controlled conditions in the lab. There are two alleles for the genene (D1, D2).  There are no known differences in reproductive success associated with the D1 or D2 allele, and neither the D1 or D2 alleles are transformed by mutation.  The population size has been 100 flies over the last 10 generations.  a) What evolutionary mechanism is likely acting on this population (2 pts)? b) If this mechanism acts on the population long enough, what will eventually happen to the frequency of the D1 allele in this population (4 pts)? c) What will eventually happen to the frequency of the D1D2 genotype within the population (2 pts)? d) How would this evolutionary mechanism affect allele frequencies if the population size was increased to 10,000 flies (2 pts)?

The following table contains the probability distribution for the number of cars sold by a salesperson during a single shift at a car dealership in a large city.  Number of Cars Sold by a Salesperson   x 0 1 2 3 4 5   P(x) 0.27 0.28 0.20 0.15 0.08 0.02    Use the given distribution to determine the following probabilities. Round probabilities to the nearest hundredth.    What is the probability that an salesperson will sell exactly two cars in a shift? [prob1]    What is the probability that an salesperson will sell more than one car in a shift? [prob2]    What is the probability that an salesperson will sell at most one car in a shift? [prob3]    What is the probability that an salesperson will sell at least one car in a shift?

State and describe one piece of evidence (that we discussed in class) supporting the theory of evolution.  (Explaining evolution is NOT evidence.)
It is the prevailing scientific viewpoint (PSV) that our Solar System developed out of a huge cloud of interstellar material. In this first stage, this eventually evolved into a very thin disk of material with a massive developing star at it center, and all moving in a very distinctive way. A. In your own words, describe all of the relevant properties of this interstellar cloud.  B. Describe how the (PSV) explains the cloud making the transformation to that "very thin disk-like region centered on the star and moving in a very distinctive way". (remember to provide a clear, complete discussion!)  C. Describe the relevant general properties of the proto-star/proto-planetary disk that formed from this cloud.

A quality improvement team at a clinic randomly selected 11 patients and recorded their wait times after implementing a new check-in system. Before the new check-in system, the mean wait time was 22 minutes, and the standard deviation was 8 minutes.  Here are the measurements for the wait times from the sample:       10,    15,   20,   17,   30,   25,   15,   12,   12,   15,   17  The type of graph being used to display wait times is called a [a]. The shape of the distribution of wait times is [b]. The team conducting the study want to estimate the mean wait time using the new check-in system using these 11 randomly selected wait times.  To do so, they should use a(n) [c].
Based on Dr. Ayleen's lecture, what is NOT the criteria for comparing media systems?

There are 4 on-off switches in a row. a. Construct a tree diagram to model this scenario of possible configurations of on and off. b. Write out the sample space. c. Find the number of possible settings if there are no restrictions.  [c] d. Find the number of possible settings if the first and fourth switch must be on.  [d] e. Find the number of possible settings if the first and forth must be the same.  [e] f. Find the number of possible settings if no two adjacent switches can both be off.  [f] g. Find the number of possible settings if no two adjacent switches can be the same.  [g] h. Find the number of possible settings if at least two switches must be on.  [h] [Each part is worth 3 points.]

You went hiking in a famous park in Tanzania with a friend.  The friend wanders off the path and gets bitten by a poisonous snake.  The venom is known to cause severe bleeding in the internal organs which may kill your friend in just  a few minutes.  Luckily, the part ranger says he is prepared to inject your friend with a life-saving preparation.  What do you expect is in this preparation?
On December 31 of last year, the balance sheet of Union Company had accounts receivable of $74,500 and a credit balance in Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts of $5,075.  During the current year, Union's financial records included the following selected activities:  Sales on account, $298,750 Sales returns and allowances, $18,250 Collection from customers, $287,500 Accounts written off as worthless, $4,000  1. Using solely the information above, what is the ending balance for Accounts Receivable?   2. Using solely the information above, what is the ending balance for Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts?   Now, the company estimates uncollectible accounts expense for this accounting period using the accounts receivable aging method. Assume that an aging of the accounts receivable shows that $5,000 may be uncollectible. 3. What is the amount of uncollectible accounts expense?   4. What is the ending balance for Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts?   5. What is the amount of Accounts Receivable, Net?

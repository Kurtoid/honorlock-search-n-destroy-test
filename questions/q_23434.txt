3.1. A researcher is studying the effects of regional integration on income inequality using a panel data set composed of 12 Western European nations across 4 years. He hypothesizes that regional integration will increase income equality. The dependent variable is the Gini coefficient which ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 perfect inequality. Regional integration is measured by two variables: political integration and economic integration. More specifically, political integration is measured as "the number of cases referred from national courts to the European Court of Justice,'' and economic integration is measured as "the percentage of a country's total exports that go to EU countries.'' The analysis also includes controls for year, real GDP per capita, social security transfers, and outflow of foreign direct investment per worker. What are the likely consequences if this researcher uses OLS to estimate the above regression coefficients, in terms of the unbiasedness, efficiency and consistency of the estimates of the coefficients and the unbiasedness of the standard errors?

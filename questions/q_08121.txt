All parts refer to the function (-3x3+8x2-9x+15){"version":"1.1","math":"(-3x3+8x2-9x+15)"}. a. Use the Rational Root Test to list the possible roots of the function. b. Are there any rational roots of the function? Yes or No. If yes, list them here. otherwise put no. Find this graphically, algebraically will take too long. c. Use long division or synthetic division to fin the quotient (-3x3+8x2-9x+15){"version":"1.1","math":"(-3x3+8x2-9x+15)"}/ (x-2){"version":"1.1","math":"/ (x-2)"}. d. How can you check your answer from part c graphically? (Hint: Remainder Theorem, but the word theorem should not be part of this answer.)

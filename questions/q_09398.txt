(Marquardt) A middle aged female spayed dog presents to you on an emergency basis for seizures. During triage, serum glucose is found to be severely low (40 mg/dl, normal range is 75-125). After stabilization, gathering a thorough history, and a CBC/chemistry/UA, you are able to rule out many causes of hypoglycemia. You remain suspicious of an insulinoma, so you send out for a paired glucose/insulin test.     Results are:  Serum glucose: 40 mg/dl (reference range 75-125)  Serum insulin: 22.5 ulU/ml (reference range 5.2 - 41.4)  Which of the following is true?

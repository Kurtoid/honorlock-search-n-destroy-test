Pure Vapor pressure at 25degC    benzene (C6H6)  94.4 torr    chloroform (CHCl3)  172.0 torr     Using the above data, calculate the vapor pressure of chloroform over a chloroform-benzene solution at 25degC, which contains 48.2 g CHCl3 (molar mass = 119.369 g/mol) and 48.2 g C6H6 (molar mass = 78.114 g/mol) Assume the solution behaves ideally.

Short answer questions, you must show your work for all questions. Partial credit will be given where warranted but work must be shown to receive credit. Make sure to include units in those answers that need them! 1. (5 points) Below are the reduction reactions for oxygen and FAD.  1/2  O2 + 2 e- + 2 H+  H2O                   Edeg' =  0.83 V FAD + 2 e- + 2 H+  FADH2             Edeg' =  -0.22 V                         What is the potential (Edeg') for the oxidation of FADH2 by oxygen? What is the [?]Gdeg' for the oxidation of FADH2 by oxygen? If we assume that the pumping of protons in conjunction with the oxidation of FADH2 requires 120 kJ, what percentage of the energy from FADH2 oxidation is stored in the proton gradient?   2. (10 points) Sucrose is a disaccharide that is hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose. Let's consider the complete oxidation in the skeletal muscle of the resulting glucose and fructose from one molecule of sucrose. It is strongly suggested that you use a table to keep track of the metabolic pathways involved.  If both glucose and fructose are substrates for hexokinase, how many NADH, FADH2, and ATP (from substrate level phosphorylations) are produced during the complete oxidation to CO2?  If the resulting NADH and FADH2 enter electron transport, how many protons are pumped into the intermembrane space? Keep in mind that this is occurring in skeletal muscle.  Using the total number of protons pumped, what is the maximum yield of ATP in the mitochondria?   3. (10 points) Consider the production of one molecule of glucose by a C4 plant. How many molecules of CO2, NADPH, and ATP are required for its production? How many photons are required by each photosystem to produce the NADPH? If the chloroplast ATP synthase has 15 c subunits, how many protons are needed for synthesis of the required ATP?   Immediately before submitting your quiz, you must show your short answer section to your camera. We need to be able to clearly see your work so hold it about 12-18 inches away from your camera and slowly move your paper to capture the entire page. If you have multiple pages, make sure to show all pages. Please only show your short answer section, do not show scratch paper used for the multiple choice questions.

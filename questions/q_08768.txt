Which of the following is a strong base?
Use the following to answer the next two questions.  Elizabeth Booth makes occasional investments in small to medium-sized firms.  She is currently looking at a local company. The value of the company over time will depend critically on whether it receives a favorable tax treatment from its local government.  The government will decide on the tax treatment over the next year.  Elizabeth's forecast is that there is a 60% chance that the company will receive the favorable tax treatment, in which case the company will be worth $2,400,000 one year from now (at t = 1).  At the same time, there is a 40% chance that the company will not receive the favorable tax treatment, in which case the company will be worth only $1,350,000 one year from now (at t = 1). Elizabeth assumes that a 10% WACC is appropriate.  Consequently, she estimates that the company's current value at t = 0 is $1,800,000 ([0.60 x $2,400,000 + 0.40 x $1,350,000]/1.10). Given this scenario, Elizabeth is also thinking about purchasing an option to buy the company for $1,630,000 one year from now.  In other words, the exercise price on the option is $1,630,000.  She is interested in calculating the value of the option today.

Given a vertical curve 100 feet in length with the PVI at station = 3 + 75.00, elevation = 49.10 ft. The incoming grade is -0.500% and the exiting grade is +1.000%. What is the station of the low point of this curve? Formulas:          y = yBVC + G1*x + [ (G2 - G1) / (2*L) ] * x2                            xhigh/low  =  G1*L  / (G1 - G2)

After reading the paragraphs below, answer the questions that follow.Bipedalism is one of the most important characteristics of hominin evolution. The appearance of bipedalism led to anatomical changes that are considered to be distinguishing characteristics of hominin fossils. The evidence for bipedalism is supported by fossil evidence from more than 4 million years ago and 3.6-million-year-old footprints in volcanic ash.Recently, however, scientists have focused on the link between tooth structure and diet in the evolution of the early hominins, specifically in Australopithecus species. Detailed studies of hominin dental features have provided evidence of an important dietary shift that led to adaptive radiation within this genus. Most of the evidence comes from analyses of tooth size and shape, microscopic wear patterns on teeth, and jaw structure. The evidence suggests that fibrous plant materials became more important through the Pliocene, perhaps as critical components in the diet of some species.What is the most likely evolutionary link between bipedalism and changes in the diet of early hominids?

Humans have neural stem cells in two regions of the brain, the hippocampus, and the ventricular zone. Ventricular zone neural stem cells rely on various signals. One of these signals activates the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for maintaining this population of cells in an undifferentiated stage. Notch, a transmembrane receptor on the neural stem cells is activated by the binding of Jag1, a transmembrane protein that is present on endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier. The maintenance of neural stem cells through this mechanism is an example of ____.

Reading Comprehension: Read the article below and answer the questions that follow. Cat Watching 1          A spine-chilling howl comes from the backyard. I open the back door to look outside. My cat, Arthur, is staring intently at a spot in the hedge. Following his gaze, I can just make out his foe: a ginger tabby that I have not seen before. 2           Arthur watches menacingly, growling quietly, tail twitching. From the way he is poised, I sense that he is about to charge.  The ginger cat seems to be holding his ground. 3           Suddenly, Arthur pricks up his ears as a van rumbles down the street. With a final snarl, the ginger sees his chance and retreats. Arthur turns and heads towards me to be petted, reverting in an instant to the affectionate pussycat that he is. 4           For cat lovers like me, the Jekyll-and-Hyde-like nature of our pets causes endless fascination. Indeed, the two-faced nature of the cat may be one reason that so many stories in so many different cultures are about cats. Tame and affectionate during the day, cats turn into silent, menacing hunters at night. In Europe in the Middle Ages, cats were not trusted. People believed that they were associated with witchcraft, and many cats were cruelly killed. 5           Maybe that's why Arthur is always on his guard. When I disturb him during one of his frequent naps, he opens one eye and watches me silently. His pupils narrow to tiny slits when the light is bright but get much larger when it is dark to let more light in and so see more clearly. In the backyard at night, Arthur can see about six times better than I can. His eyes open even wider and turn almost completely dark when he spots a potential victim. 6          Like all cats, Arthur loves to hunt. Butterflies and moths are his favorite prey--an easy catch--but he has been known to bring me a mouse or two, and once he brought me a large rat. He stalks his prey for a long time, remaining low to the ground and motionless until he is ready to pounce. The slaughter is mainly bloodless. I was glad of that when Arthur brought the rat into the living room! 7          All cats have more highly developed senses than we do as well as an additional sense called the "taste-smell" sense that humans do not have. This, as you might imagine, is a combination of taste and smell. When Arthur rejects the new cat food (always the cheaper brand, of course!) he is rejecting the smell as much as the taste. His formidable hearing is another advantage. Designed to help him identify the smallest movement of prey in the wild, it now lets him know when a can of cat food is being opened two blocks away. 8           One of Arthur's most prominent features is his majestic whiskers. A cat's whiskers are extremely sensitive, with tiny nerve endings. These allow Arthur to feel his way into dark corners and crannies, to squeeze in the cat door at night, and to hide under the blankets at the bottom of my bed. 9          The evening is Arthur's favorite time. Refreshed from his nap on the sofa, he heads outside to check on his territory. In general, he is protective of his space, with one exception. He has a cordial relationship with his next-door neighbor Pickles, who shows up in my kitchen every now and then for food. Whenever Pickles shows up, the two cats circle each other, moving sideways. Pickles reaches out a tentative paw to see how close he can get. Arthur often pretends to be interested in something else, but the tenseness of his body indicates that he is aware of every move the other cat makes. If he decides to be friendly, he might roll over on its back to show submission. The two cats also rub heads to show friendliness and to share each other's scent. 10        Humans' love affair with the cat has lasted for at least 5,000 years. Long ago, cultures appreciated them for the same reasons that I do--for the role they play in keeping away rats and mice. The Egyptians considered cats sacred, however. Cats show up in Egyptian tomb paintings, carvings, and jewelry. I think Arthur would like that. He is clearly the king in my house.

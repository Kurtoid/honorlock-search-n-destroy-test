(30 points) Annual demand for pencils at a store is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 250. The store purchases the pencils for 6 cents each and sells them for 20 cents each. There is a two-month lead time from the initiation to the receipt of an order. The store accountant estimates that the cost to initiate and receive an order is $20, and recommends a 22 percent annual interest rate for determining holding cost. The cost of a stock-out is the cost of lost profit plus an additional 20 cents per pencil, which represents the cost of loss of goodwill.  a) (25 pts) Find the simultaneous optimal values of Q and R. b) (5 pts) What is the safety stock for this item at the optimal solution?

For questions 2-4 we are going to use the abalone dataset. All questions are independent to each other. You do not have to use code for the following questions. We will build a linear regression model using the Length (in mm) as the response variable and the Sex (Infant, Male, Female) and Height (in mm) as predicting variables. Using Sex = Female as the base case, we create 2 indicator (or dummy) variables SexInfant and SexMale for Sex = Infant and Sex = Male, re spectively. Then, we fit the model and we obtain the output provided below. Use this output to answer questions 2 & 3.
For each factor in the first column, determine whether it will increase or decrease blood pressure.

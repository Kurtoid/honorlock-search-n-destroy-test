Mis padres vinieron aqui de Italia en 1960 y construyeron (built) una casa pequena en el pueblo. Mi padre abrio un restaurante italiano pero luego decidio especializarse en comida Mexicana. Despues de muchos anos, mis padres construyeron una casa mucho mas grande y elegante en el campo. Es alli donde yo vivo con mi esposa, Elena, y mis dos hijos, Samuel y Carmelita. Mi trabajo en el estaurante es muy duro; las horas son larguisimas, pero somos felices aqui. Cuando cocino, me gusta cantar, especialmente opera. Mi especialidad es la cocina mexicana: arroz, frijoles, carne...pero a veces cocino algo diferente, como la tortilla espanola. No uso receta porque la tortilla no es muy complicada: huevos, aceite, cebollas, papas y un poco de sal. Mi amigo Tono cena aqui mucho porque la comida es buena y barata, y a Tono no le gusta cocinar. Ayer le cocine arroz con pollo y se lo servi con una ensalada. A ver (let's see) que pide hoy...   El padre de Manolo abrio un restaurante mexicano.

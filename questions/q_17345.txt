A doctoral student had been using a smartphone before her program began, but is finding it limiting in her ability to create and access information quickly. She does not want to carry her laptop everywhere she goes, particularly as it is not always useful in taking notes in a class like Statistics. There is so much to do and keep track of; she needs a better system.  How should she improve management of her Core 4?
Factor out the GCF from the polynomial. Note: To input an exponent, like , type x^3 by using the carat (^) to indicate the exponent. Do not use spaces! Enter your answer as an expression. Example: 3x^2+1, x/5, (a+b)/c. Make sure your variables match those in the question.

Chapter 11: You're studying cellular signaling through G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, you're working on a pair of newly identified GPCRs, GPCR-A and GPCR-B. Each binds the same small ligand but activates different heterotrimeric G-proteins that act on adenylyl cyclase.    A (3 points). Your grad student mentor explains that both the receptors and the Ga and Gbg subunits of the heterotrimeric G-proteins are membrane-associated. You're puzzled because although you find obvious transmembrane domains in the receptor, you find none in Ga or Gbg. How are G-proteins specifically the Ga and Gbg subunits associated with the membrane (be specific)?      You find that the binding of ligand has opposite effects on adenylyl cyclase activity for each receptor. GPCR-A causes an increase in adenylyl cyclase activity, while GPCR-B causes a decrease in adenylyl cyclase activity. B (1 points). Based on the above-stated effects on adenylyl cyclase activity, what type of G-protein is activated by each receptor?

You have two true-breeding fruit fly stocks in your lab: Stock 1: thread (th) shaped antennae, scarlet (st) colored eyes Stock 2: ebony (e) colored body All three mutant phenotypes are recessive. You cross these two stocks and collect female F1 progeny.  You then perform a test cross. All three genes are linked.   A. What is the genotype of the F1 females and the males in your test cross? B. Below is the map for these three genes. You perform your test cross, and count 1000 F2 progeny. Identify all possible phenotype classes in the F2 generation, and the number you would expect for each genotype, given the distances between these genes. Assume no chromosomal interference.
SA1 - BlueJack Jackets Suppose BluJack is a monopolist producer of a brand of jackets with a marginal cost of $8 and no fixed costs. The company sells these jackets both in the United States of America and in the European Union with the following yearly demand curves for jackets:  If BluJack chooses to sell jackets in the USA, it faces an American demand of P=100-Q with Marginal revenue = 100-2Q. If BluJack chooses to sell jackets in the EU, it faces a  European demand of P= 200-3Q with Marginal revenue = 100-6Q. If BluJack must sell jackets to both markets at the same price, it faces a total demand of P=125-0.75Q with Marginal revenue = 125-1.5Q  a) If BluJack cannot price discriminate, how much will it produce, how much will it charge, and what would be its profit? (Show your work) b) What price would BlueJack charge per jacket if it was operating under perfect competition?

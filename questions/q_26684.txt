A student set up an experiment to show the effect of light color on photosynthesis in Elodea plants. She filled three test tubes with distilled water and placed a piece of Elodea in each of the tubes. She added a drop of phenol red, which turns red in a basic solution and yellow in an acidic solution. She blew in each tube to add carbon dioxide, which caused the distilled water to become more acidic so the phenol red turned yellow. She exposed: Tube A to white light Tube B to green light Tube C no light (wrapped in aluminum foil) Which of the tubes should she expect to turn red the fastest?

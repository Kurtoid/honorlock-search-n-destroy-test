The absorbance vs wavelength profile of four different solutions is given below. The four solutions contain the identical solute but differ in solute concentration: 0.100 M, 0.150 M, 0.200 M and 0.250 M. All analyses are conducted in a 2.00-cm diameter cuvette.  Report your answer to each question or problem below. Make sure you reference your answers by numbering them according to the question or problem. You do not need to show calculations. 1. What is the value of lamda-max for the solution containing 0.150 M of the solute? (2 pts) 2. Use the plotting application made available to you at the link below and construct a calibration plot for a Beer's Law analysis performed at 700 nm. Report the value of the slope associated with the line of best fit. https://www.desmos.com/calculator/2rnqgoa6a4 (4 pts) 3. If a solution of the solute has an absorbance reading of 0.682 at a wavelength of 700 nm, what is the molar concentration of the solute? (2 pts) 4. Report the value (including correct units) of the solute's molar absorptivity at 700 nm. (2 pts)

27) Diana is a research psychologist. She arranged for four different women (of similar appearance) to attend a college class a certain number of times throughout the semester. One woman attended zero lectures, one attended five times, one attended ten times, and the last woman attended fifteen times. These women didn't interact with anyone; they just sat in on the lecture. At the end of the semester, Diana showed the other students in the class pictures of each of the women and asked the students to rate all four women in terms of physical attractiveness.  On average, the students evaluated the woman who they had seen 15 different times much more positively than the woman they hadn't seen at all. The scenario above is most consistent with what phenomenon in psychology?

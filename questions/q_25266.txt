Two phenotypically normal sisters with teratoma and gonadoblastoma underwent laboratory investigations to determine the reason for their observed phenotypes.  RT-PCR was performed on mRNA isolated from gonadal tissue to determine the mRNA expression of SRY (Panel A), DAX-1 (Panel B), SOX9 (Panel C), and SF1 (Panel E) in the sisters (1 & 2) and a normal 46, XY individual as a control (C).  The results were normalized to the expression of 18S rRNA in the sample. FISH revealed that the patients had a 46,XY SRY+ karyotype. Comparative genomic hybridization revealed that the genetic dose of SOX9, SF-1, and SRY was normal, and the dose of DAX-1 exons was duplicated. Which of the following options best explains the phenotype in these sisters?         A Increased DAX-1 expression resulted in gonadal dysgenesis and 46, XY female phenotype   B Increased SRY expression resulted in gonadal dysgenesis and 46, XY female phenotype   C Decreased SOX9 levels resulted in gonadal dysgenesis and 46, XY development   D Decreased SF1 levels resulted in gonadal dysgenesis and 46, XY development

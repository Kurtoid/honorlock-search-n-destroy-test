Please use the following information to answer the question(s) below.Big Bend National Park in Texas is mostly Chihuahuan desert where rainfall averages about 10 inches per year. Yet when hiking in this bone-dry desert it is not uncommon to encounter mosses and ferns. One such plant is called "flower of stone." It is not a flowering plant, nor does it produce seeds. Under arid conditions, its leaflike structures curl up. However, when it rains, it unfurls its leaves, which form a bright green rosette on the desert floor. Consequently, it is sometimes called the "resurrection plant."Upon closer inspection of the leaves of flower of stone, one can observe tiny, cone-like structures. Each cone-like structure emits spores of two different sizes. Further investigation also reveals that the roots of flower of stone branch only at the growing tip of the root, forming a Y-shaped structure. Consequently, flower of stone should be expected to possess which other characteristics?1. a gametophyte generation that is dominant2. lignified vascular tissues3. microphylls4. spores that are diploid when mature

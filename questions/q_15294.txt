Senario QusestionsPlease use the following information to answer the question(s) below.Placozoan evolutionary relationships to other animals are currently unclear, and different phylogenies can be created, depending on the characters used to infer relatedness. Placozoans are multicellular invertebrates with a simple structure of only two tissue layers and only four cell types. They have the smallest amount of DNA measured in any animal. In comparison, sponges have no tissues but about 20 cell types. One species of placozoans, Tp (Trichoplax adhaerens), produces a neuropeptide almost identical to one found in cnidarians. The genome of Tp, although the smallest of any known animal, shares many features of complex eumetazoan (even human!) genomes. The next three questions refer to the phylogenetic trees that follow. In the trees, the outgroup is a taxon that is outside the group of interest; members of the group of interest are more closely related to one another than to the outgroup.Which tree(s) has (have) been created by emphasizing the structural simplicity of placozoans?

Octavius's parents own a garage where they service a variety of cars. They are looking at reviewing contracts with their suppliers for car parts. In order to do so, they want to see the distribution of the different types car parts they have used over the past year. This will allow them to identify the parts that they order most frequently within each month. What chart would be appropriate for them to plot the number of parts sold (or used) within each of the categories (engine, transmission, chassis etc.) over the past 12 months? (Hint: Single Variable over a long period of time)

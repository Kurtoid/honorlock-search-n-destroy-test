The process used to verify attendance is determined by instructional method (traditional, online, or hybrid):  If I am in a traditional course, I understand I am expected to attend each class and must attend at least one live, face-to-face class before the "deadline to report never attends" as indicated in the student calendar, or I will be dropped. Completion of the syllabus quiz does not verify attendance in traditional courses. If I am enrolled in a hybrid or online class, I will meet weekly assignment and/or test due dates. Completion of the syllabus quiz verifies attendance in a hybrid or online course. If I fail to submit this syllabus quiz, I may be dropped from this online or hybrid course.

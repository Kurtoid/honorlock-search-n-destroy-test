Use this information and graphs for the next two questions: Dr. Jane Lubchenco looked at effects of the herbivorous snail Littorina littorea on diversity of macroalgae (seaweed) on the New England (MA) coast. She studied tidepools in the upper intertidal zone and on surfaces of very large (immovable) rocks lower down in the low intertidal zone. (The intertidal zone is the zone between highest and lowest tides).      The research began from visual observations. In the tidepools, Lubchenco noticed that algal diversity was different from pool to pool. Some were dominated by one species (such as the green alga, Enteromorpha intestinalis) while others supported 10 or more seaweed species. Snail density also differed between pools. In the field, Lubchenco manipulated snail density (abundance) in studies lasting several years. She measured diversity of seaweed in the pools and on the rock surface and compared the relationship between snail density and algal diversity in the two habitats. In this study, Lubchenco examined the diversity of algae in a disturbed area such as a rock surface in the low intertidal compared to an undisturbed tidepool in the high intertidal zone. Interpret the results and answer the questions below.

Your client, who is wealthy and in the top marginal income tax bracket, is interested in purchasing a franchise with some of his friends. After carefully reviewing the proposal, you have determined that apart from a large up-front investment, the business will not need to retain income and income generated in future years will be paid out to the investors.

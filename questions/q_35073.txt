Many songbirds breed in North America in the spring and summer, and then migrate to Central and South America in the fall. They spend the winter in these warmer areas where they feed and prepare for the spring migration north and another breeding season. Two hypothetical species of sparrow, A and B, overwinter together in mixed flocks in Costa Rica. In spring, species A goes to the east coast of North America, and species B goes to the west coast. What can you say about the isolating mechanisms of these two species?

Now suppose you decided to use your expertise to synthesize two different types of copolymers, still made out of the same MMA and VDF monomers as in the prior problem, but now comparing the free radical polymerization to a "living" anionic polymerization that enables you to synthesize a block copolymer.  Given that the properties weren't too good for your prior copolymer, you decided to compare these two reactions at an 70:30 composition of MMA:VDF.  The first analysis you did was run some DMTA curves to compare the properties of the block versus random copolymers.      - Which curve corresponds to the 70:30 copolymer of poly(methyl methacrylate-block-vinylidene fluoride)?  (red or blue)  [1] - Which curve corresponds to the 70:30 copolymer of poly(methyl methacrylate-statistical-vinylidene fluoride)?  (red or blue) [2] - Which copolymer would you expect to have the highest Young's modulus at room temperature? (red or blue) [3] - Which copolymer would you expect to have the best damping behavior at room temperature? (red or blue) [4] - Which of the following best describes the physical state of the red copolymer at room temperature?  Choose from A - E.  [5]               (A)  Viscous "melt" (sticky gooey)               (B)  Rubbery elastomer               (C)  Highly flexible and tough               (D)  Moderately rigid with some toughness               (E)  Glassy and brittle - Which of the following best describes the physical state of the blue copolymer at room temperature?  Choose from A - E.  [6]               (A)  Viscous "melt" (sticky gooey)               (B)  Rubbery elastomer               (C)  Highly flexible and tough               (D)  Moderately rigid with some toughness               (E)  Glassy and brittle

Nurse Joan is working in the ICU at University Hospital. She is carrying out Dr. Jones' order for a medication prescribed to one of her patients. She has received the medication and is preparing to administer it to the patient. Upon entering the patient's room, she asks the patient his name and date of birth, and compares this information to the label on the medication. Joan then administers the medication to the patient. This scenario is an example of __________.
Evaluate 8!A) 40320      B) 44440        C) 4032           D) 80000

Extra Credit:  The above questions asked about Epi-Pens, commonly carried these days by patients with very severe allergies and other problems.  However, the technology for Epi-Pens came from the military; during the 1970s the US military developed a form of the AtroPen(r), a self-injecting pen containing atropine.  Why would Army soldiers and Marines need to carry injectible atropine more than the average American civilian?

SBA TAAK 004 - AFDELING A  VRAAG 3: OPSOMMING TEKS C     Druk op die onderstaande knoppie om die Opsomming Teks in 'n ander bladsy oop te maak.   In die resensie uit Boeke - Beeld lewer die resensent kommentaar oor die jeugboek Droomvangers. Lees die resensie aandagtig deur en voer die instruksies hieronder uit.  1.            Som die kommentaar oor hierdie jeugboek op in SEWE sinne. 2.            Jou opsomming mag nie langer as 80 woorde wees nie. 3.            Gebruik jou EIE woorde en skryf die kommentaar in VOLSINNE neer. 4.            Dui die getal woorde aan wat jy in die opsomming gebruik het.   Lekker om weer 'n Preller-jeugboek te lees.  1. Dit is altyd lekker om 'n nuwe boek van Martie Preller, een van die voorste, en gelukkig ook produktiefste, Afrikaanse kinder- en jeugboekskrywers te lees. 2. Sy skryf vir verskillende ouderdomsgroepe en wissel haar aanslag gedurig. 3. Of sy fantasie, wetenskapfiksie, kies-jou-eie-avontuur of allerdaagse realistiese fiksie skryf, sy doen dit altyd met genoeg humor en in 'n lekker leesstyl. 4. 'n Droomvanger hang jy voor jou venster en dit laat goeie drome deur. Freddie, die hoofkarakter in die boek, raak moedeloos en gooi sy droomvanger weg. Sy droom om gou ryk te word, word dan tog skielik waar, maar met onaangename nagevolge. 5. Hy verloor goeie vriende in die proses en wie hy gedink het sy nuwe groot vriend is, bring hom in groot moeilikheid. 6. Ondanks die voorspelbaarheid van die verhaal (die leser weet lank voor Freddie, eintlik reg van die begin af, dat hy bedrieg word en vind dit vreemd dat hy dit nie ook kan insien nie) lees dit lekker. 7. Martie Preller slaag daarin om alles nie soos 'n les te laat klink nie, iets wat Afrikaanse kinder- en jeugboekskrywers dikwels baie moeilik vind.   Aantal woorde 196.

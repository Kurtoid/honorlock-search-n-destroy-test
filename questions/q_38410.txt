Denny studied the relationships between postural change on cardiovascular reactivity in a sample of healthy men and women.  Change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from supine to standing position was used as the measure of cardiac reactivity in a sample of 842 adults.  Supine measurement of blood pressure was taken after participants had lain on an examination table for 15 minutes. Participants then stood up and an additional measurement was made at the 1 minute mark. A p value was set at 0.05 prior to the study. A Pearsons r of 0.52 (p = 0.02) was calculated to determine the relationship between standing position and the SBP. Below is a table describing the characteristics of Denny's sample. Table 1.

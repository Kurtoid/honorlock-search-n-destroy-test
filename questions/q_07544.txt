There are nine restaurants in the hotel, but we didn't eat in all of them.During our trip, we went to the Burj Khalifa, one of the tallest buildings in the world.

We could see the city, the desert, and the ocean!And of course, the shopping was fantastic--we bought some nice clothes. There are many modern shopping malls in Dubai, but I liked the old markets the best because I liked the traditional shops and buildings. We bought lots of souvenirs there.

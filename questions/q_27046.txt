A uniform solid cylinder of mass 10 kg can rotate about a frictionless axle through its center O, as shown in the cross-sectional view in the figure. A rope wrapped around the outer radius R1 = 1.0 m exerts a force of magnitude F1 = 5.0 N to the right. A second rope wrapped around another section of radius R2 = 0.50 m exerts a force of magnitude F2 = 6.0 N downward. What is the angular acceleration of the cylinder? The moment of inertia of the solid cylinder is 1/2 (MR 2 ).

A sheet of metal with a length of 1.5 m and width of 2 m is placed on the surface of a wooden table. A 0.0015 m thick dielectric cotton tablecloth with a permittivity of 4.8x10-11 C2/Nm2 is laid on top of the metal sheet and another identical metal plate is placed on the first piece of metal. Each plate is hooked up to opposite terminals of a 12 V car battery.    a) What is the charge that develops on the capacitor plates? b) How much energy is stored by the capacitor? c) Calculate the strength of the electric field between the capacitor plates.   Suddenly a large punch bowl is spilled on the table soaking the tablecloth and changing the permittivity of the cloth to 7.7x10-10 C2/Nm2. Answer the following questions assuming the cloth is soaked as described. d)How much charge is on the plates now. e) Find the energy stored by the capacitor when the tablecloth is soaked. f) Now the metal plates are disconnected from the battery. If the cloth dries overnight returning the tablecloth to its original condition, then calculate the energy stored in the capacitor the next day. g)What is the new potential difference the next day?   part a) Co =1.77x10-8 F

A social media influencer decided to monetize her popularity by opening a pop-up nightclub for three nights only. She offered a position at the club to an up-and-coming DJ. During negotiations, the influencer agreed to pay the DJ$1,000 to perform per night, but insisted that if the DJ quit during the club's run, he would have to pay a "penalty" of$500 per night for each night that he did not perform, because it would cost the influencer several thousand dollars to hire a replacement DJ at the last minute. The parties agreed in writing to those terms. The DJ performed the first night to very low attendance. Not wanting to hurt his own reputation by being associated with an unpopular nightclub, the DJ refused to perform the rest of his contract. Fortunately for the influencer, the DJ's replacement had great success on the second night the club was open, and attendance at the nightclub skyrocketed the third and final night, making profits that greatly exceeded anyone's expectations. If the influencer brings a lawsuit against the DJ to recover $1,000, the amount due under the "penalty" provision, is the influencer likely to prevail?

An electronics manufacturer produces three models of mp3 players, model A, model B, and model C.  The company knows how much assembly and testing time is needed for each model.  Model A requires 0.4 hours of assembly and 0.2 hours being tested.  Model B requires 0.5 hours of assembly and 0.3 hours being tested.  Model C requires 0.8 hours of assembly and 0.6 hours being tested.  The company decides it should produce three times as many model B players as model C players.  If the company has allocated 600 hours for assembly, and 370 hours for testing, how many of each model should the company produce if it wants to use all the time allocated for each phase of the process?

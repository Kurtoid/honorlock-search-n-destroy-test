Choose the tone that applies to the passage. Laws should be passed to limit the personal wealth of overly rich Americans. One percent of American families control more than 40 percent of the nation's wealth. Many of them play and prosper while everyday folks struggle to survive. More than three million Americans are homeless, and many poor children suffer from malnutrition. Middle-class families, too, are affected by America's unequal distribution of wealth, with many parents unable to afford to send their children to college. We must join the many ordinary, hard-working Americans all across the country that are speaking out in favor of a more just and appropriate system of distribution of wealth. After all, the spoiled rich don't deserve to be rich.
In a controlled laboratory environment, a random sample of 10 adults and a random sample of 10 children were tested by a psychologist to determine the room temperature that each person finds most comfortable. The data are summarized below: __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________Sample Mean_________Sample Variance__________________ Adults (1)                                                                                 77.5F                                          4.5 Children (2)                                                                             74.5F                                          2.5                                                       Suppose that the psychologist decides to construct a 99% confidence interval for the difference in mean comfortable room temperatures instead of proceeding with a test of hypothesis. The 99% confidence interval turns out to be (-2.9, 3.1). Select the correct statement.

The energy of the hydrogen atom in the ground state (n = l) is 2.18x10-18 J. A particle strikes a hydrogen atom and excites the electron to its 4th energy level (n = 4) with energy of 1.36x10-19 J. If the electron returns to the ground state in one step,  the energy of the photon emitted  is [answer1] x 10[answer2] J. [?]E = RH(1/m2  - 1/n2) Both m and n represent different shells. RH = 2.18 x 10-18 J/photon

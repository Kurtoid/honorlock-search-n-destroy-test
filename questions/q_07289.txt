Title of essay: "Letter from Birmingham Jail"Author: Martin Luther King, Jr.  I would agree with St. Augustine that "an unjust law is no law at all." . . . How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? . . . An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas [a thirteenth-century Christian theologian]: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and changes the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an "I-it" relationship for an "I-thou" relationship and ends relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically, and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation and existential expression of man's tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right, and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.King's assumption, based in part on Augustine's observation that "an unjust law is no law at all," can be paraphrased correctly to mean that

An instructional resources company claims to have a method to train students which will increase their scores on any standardized test. Concerned that their admission process would be adversely affected, a large university decides to test this claim. The registrar selects, using a method which is independent and random, a group of n=150 high school students. This group is randomly divided in two, n1 =75 students are sent to be trained to increase their test scores and n2 =75 students are shown an inspirational movie to act as a control group.               After training both groups are administered an old I.Q. test, the following results are obtained Ms1=107 and Ms2=102.Any changes due to training represent a change in the location of the mean rather the shape of the distribution, hence s1 = s2.= 15   Compute a 95% confidence interval for u1-u2, the difference in mean I.Q. scores for trained and untrained populations.

Q1 of 4: Use this information for this question and the next three questions:A geneticist is mapping the chromosomes of the newly identified species, with the common name gremlins. An individual called Stripe has been captured and  is being bred in order to understand gremlin genetics. Stripe is heterozygous for three linked genes with alleles Bb, Ee, and Hh, that determine if gremlins have biting teeth (B), are evil (E), and have hair (H). In order to determine if the three genes are linked, a standard testcross was done to another captive gremlin that is homozygous recessive for alleles at all three genes. One thousand offspring were collected and found to have the following genotypes:    48 ee Hh bb       36 ee hh Bb       400 ee Hh Bb       4 Ee Hh Bb       426 Ee hh bb       46 Ee hh Bb       38 Ee Hh bb       2 ee hh bb    Disregarding the gene order, which may or may not be correct as shown, which of the below best represents the arrangement (configuration) of the alleles on Stripes' chromosomes?

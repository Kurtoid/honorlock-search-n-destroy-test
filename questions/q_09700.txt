Intravenous fluid bags are filled by an automated filling machine. Assume that the fill volumes of the bags are independent, normal random variables with a standard deviation of 0.08 fluid ounces.  This question is part of a quiz or exam given at Arizona State University, copywritten by Dr. L. Chattin.  It may not be reproduced, posted or distributed without permission of Arizona State University and L. Chattin. The standard error of the sample mean of n = 25 bags is [x][y].  The population mean fill volume should be set equal to [z] fluid ounces so that the probability that the average of these 25 bags is below 6.0 ounces is 0.001.

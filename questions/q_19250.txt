Which heart defect produces a systolic ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border with a thrill palpated at the upper left sternal border?
A female patient who is 5'7" tall and weighs 68 kg is being mechanically ventilated with volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation (VC-CMV), set rate 12, patient trigger rate 25 bpm, tidal volume (VT) 500 mL, set flow rate 60 L/min, fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) 40%, positive-end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cm H2O. The patient is currently in distress using accessory muscles of inspiration. A patient-ventilator system check is performed by the respiratory therapist. The flow-time waveform shows a failure of the expiratory flow to return to zero before the next breath is triggered. The most appropriate action for the respiratory therapist to take includes which of the following?

On January 1, 2020, Thor Co. issued a 4-year, $750,000, 6% fixed interest note at par, with interest payable semiannually on June 30 and December 31.  Thor now wants to change the note to a variable rate note.  As a result, on January 1, 2021, Thor enters into an interest rate swap where it agrees to receive 6% fixed and pay the LIBOR rate on a notional amount of $750,000.  At each 6-month period, the variable rate will be reset and will be used to determine the variable rate to be paid for the following six-month period.  The LIBOR rate is 6.6% on January 1, 2021 and 5.6% on June 30, 2021.  The fair value of the swap was $0 on January 1, 2021 and $30,000 on June 30, 2021.  The fair value of the note was $750,000 on January 1, 2021 and $780,000 on June 30, 2021. Required:  Answer the following questions based on the information above.  In your response, be sure to specify which question you are answering by numbering your responses (1, 2, or 3).  Assuming that all requirements for hedge accounting are met, what is the correct hedging classification (type) for this internet rate swap?

This diagram below shows a transverse plane view of someone performing the up phase of a bench press. Inverse dynamics have been performed to analyze the first segment (the hand) so that the joint reaction force and the joint moment acting AT THE WRIST ON THE HAND have been determined (RWH and MWH). Use the information in the table below to move up the kinetic change and perform a dynamic equilibrium analysis of the forearm to solve for the joint reaction force at the elbow acting on the forearm.     Joint Reaction Force at the Wrist on the Hand  RWH = 20 x + 280 y (N)   Mass of Forearm  m = 3 kg   Linear Acceleration of the Forearm  a = -0.1 x + 0.6 y

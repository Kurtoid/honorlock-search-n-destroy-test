In a forensic case, the investigators are trying to assign a newborn in the hospital to the parents. If the sizes of PCR amplicons for a single STR site in the genome were obtained from the individuals indicated, which couple would most likely be the parents of the newborn? (Each peak indicates a different size of the STR region amplified with PCR).

Recall that energy from passing high-energy electrons down the "steps" of the electron transport chain is harnessed to move protons (via active transport) into the mitochondrial intermembrane space. How does this help the mitochondrion to produce energy?

People running IT (information technology) departments have a persistent problem: many users do not use good security procedures. They open attachments from strangers, visit risky websites, and generally do things that are bad for their devices. The real problem, though is an incentive problem: When I do something that gets my computer infected with malware, I hurt myself, but I also endanger everyone else using the same network.

Parasitism B. Suppose the researchers conducted an experiment to investigate whether other species of defensive symbionts can protect fruit flies from the nematode parasite (Howardula). In the first experiment, they screened for beneficial symbiotic bacteria by searching for species similar to Spiroplasma bacteria.  They established a large population of fruit flies and exposed them to a nematode parasite. Then they separated the fruit fly individuals into two treatment groups: those without parasite (Howardula) and those with parasite (Howardula). They screened (looked) one of seven species of symbionts (A-G). The results are shown in Table 1 below.  Table 1. Percentage of Fruit Fly Individuals with Different Species of Symbionts         Bacterial Species       Treatment   A   B   C   D   E   F   G     Howardula absent   50   40   80   30   50   95   30     Howardula present   50   90   10   30   75   95   96     B. How many bacterial species appear to be a defensive symbiont species? Explain (what evidence do you have). (3pts)

Question 1 - Data Exploration (20 Points) A. Use appropriate graphical analytics techniques to evaluate the nature of the change time series data (*-Pct for each of the four time series) as well as their respective first and second differences. B. On the first difference of each change time series, fit a different kind of exploratory modelling technique from Unit 1 (your choice but all three must differ). For each model, perform graphical analysis on the residuals to evaluate serial correlation, and variance consistency. How you choose to select and implement models is left up to you; there is no one "right" way to complete this task. C. Citing the relevant theory provided in the description of the data, comment on the potential viability of the following modeling techniques if applied to the first difference of the data: ARIMA, ARIMA-GARCH, Unrestricted VAR, Sine-Cosine Harmonic.

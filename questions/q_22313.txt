Bonus) ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner. The tool bar has indent functions. Write a System Verilog test bench named counterMV_tb that tests the counter in problem 2. Instantiate counterMV to count clock edges up to 11 and then start over at 0, that is 0-11,0-11,.... Set Size in this instance appropriate to facilitate this action but no greater. The test bench should create a clock signal with 20 positive clock edges. You can use a loop. Include a $display or $monitor which writes out the value of count and carry on each of these positive clock edges. For maximum credit your code should carefully follow the specification. Use the minimum number of lines to accomplish this specification. Also use proper indentation for organization. Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables. Do not use compiler directives except perhaps `timescale. ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate

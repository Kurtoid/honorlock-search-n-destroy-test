You are working in a histopathology laboratory for transmission electron microscopy.  One of the fixatives your investigator is using is osmium tetroxide.  You must transfer the material to a secondary container and make a solution from it with acetone.  The manufacturer is Chemicals-R-Us.  The solute you are going to use is 10% acetone from the same company.  It is flammable, volatile, moderately toxic, and not corrosive. Please fill out the OSHA label for Osmium tetroxide 10%.  It is not corrosive, highly flammable, moderately reactive, and classified as both a reproductive and central nervous system toxin.  It can be absorbed across skin and mucous membranes. It also has a low volatility point. What other precautions should you take with storage of this substance?

Essay Set 1: Essay 1. Identify differences and similarities between transcription in prokaryotes with that in eukaryotes. Address differences/similarities in transcriptional initiation, promoter elements, cellular location, possible regulatory mechanisms, and enzymes and key accessory proteins. Essay 2.  There are two major classes of membrane transport proteins:  pumps/transporters/carriers and channels. Compare and contrast these two groups of proteins (regulation, localization, activity, etc.). Provide a specific example of a transport protein for each of these two broad categories making sure to include their function and subcellular localization. Essay 3.  For proteins >60kD in size, transport across the nuclear envelope is a 'receptor' mediated process. Describe in detail this bidirectional transport process making sure to touch on proteins involved in both import and export processes and how the differential localization of Ran-GAP and Ran-GEF influences this process.

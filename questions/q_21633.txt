The experiment shown below uses two strains of mice that differ in their MHC genes. Strain A is H-2a and Strain B is H-2b. Mice of each strain are infected with the virus LCMV, and T cells are isolated at day 8 post-infection. These T cells are mixed with target cells that express either H-2a or H-2b; in each case, the target cells are either uninfected or infected with LCMV. After a four-hour incubation of T cells with target cells, the percentage of target cells lysed by the T cells is shown in the graph. What immunological process is demonstrated by this experiment and explain how it does so: (10 sentences max).
Please use the information below to answer questions 3-5. When there are not sufficient comparable sales for the appraisers to estimate the value of a vacant land parcel, normally the appraisers would apply the fundamental land residual analysis to determine the highest and best use of the vacant land parcel and its highest land value. Suppose the screening process produces three potential uses for a vacant site. For each of those potential uses, the development costs, expected annual income generated from the property under each use, the expected rate of return (discount rate) are shown in the table below.      Potential Uses     Office  Retail  Hotel    Annual Income  $                    300,000  $                   250,000  $                   600,000   Expected Rate of Return  9% 10% 15%   Development Cost (Value of the Improvements)  $                2,000,000  $                1,400,000  $                2,500,000   Value of the Property (Land & Improvements)         Land Residual Value            3.  What is the estimated land residual value under the use of office applying the fundamental land residual analysis?

A piston-cylinder device contains 2 kg of air initially at 120 kPa and 27oC before heat is transferred in through the cylinder wall until its volume is tripled.  The weight of the piston is such that it allows the air to expand at constant pressure during the process.  Assume air as ideal gas with variable specific heat, determine:  the work done by the air, in kJ; the total heat transferred to the air, in kJ;    Does the level of disorganization of the air energy increased or decreased during this process? Please properly justify your answer from the perspective of entropy change and entropy balance relationship.  Note: Rair = 0.287 kJ/(kgxK) Please do NOT type.  Please write your detailed solutions on the exam paper.  Thank you.

Counterfeit luxury goods are a major problem in some Asian countries. Women that purchase counterfeit bags feel a thrill when they are able to fool others into believing they own a luxury brand. However, the major reason for the deception is that people in those cultures place high value on luxury brands. By showing off the brand, these women are demonstrating that they can afford the best. The emphasis and value placed on status is an example of a(n) _________________.

Below is an excerpt from an appellate brief  The blanks represent spots for citations In the case, the Court ruled that contracts could not be enforced if there was no proof of reasonable consideration.   A. __________________________.   However, the decision did not give any guidance as to what "reasonable" monetary consideration is, simply stating that it be more than ten dollars. B.___________________.   The Court did specify that consideration could include "refraining" from an activating. C. ____________________.     The blank following #A above is the first cite of our brief, and it comes from Pg. 69 of the Plunkett case (already referenced in another question).  Thus, the blank A should be filled with the full citation from the Plunkett v. Hotard  case (the same citation you selected in the prior question)). Blank B is also from the Plunkett v. Hotard case, but on page 71.   Blank C is from the Plunkett v. Hotard case on page 71.  Write the appropriate citations for blanks A, B and C.  (use the short form, if appropriate).

16. Suppose the mass of a fully loaded module in which astronauts take off from the Moon is 12,000 kg. The thrust of its engines is 120,000 N. Calculate its acceleration in a vertical takeoff from the Moon. Remember to use gravity on the moon (1/6 of earth) and that the sum of the forces = mass x acceleration = FThrust - wmoon.
The goal of reinforcement learning is to find a  balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).
For any event E, the probability of E, , must always be between:
[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).] A box weighing 654-N is sliding down an inclined ramp.  Ms. Strong grabs at a rope on the box and tries to stop the sliding.   Shortly after grabbing the rope, the is sliding down the ramp at an angle  = 33 degrees from horizontal.  The woman is applying a force, F1, directed parallel to the ramp in the direction towards the top of the ramp, such that the box is now moving down the ramp and slowing down at a rate of 2 m/s2.  The coefficient of static friction between the ramp and the box is 0.900 and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the ramp and the box is 0.600.      a. (4 pts) Draw an FBD of the box during the time described and choose/label an appropriate coordinate system.   b. (12 pts) Determine the size of the woman's force, F1.  Enter your answer in the box below.  Write out your calculations on paper (blank paper or a blank problem-solving template). c. (4 pts) If the angle were changed to 45 degrees, what would happen to each force acting on the box- increase, decrease, or stay the same size?  Give your answers and explanation in the box below.  Your Answer:
The function of this organic molecule is to store the hereditary information of an organism; it gets passed on to the offspring.

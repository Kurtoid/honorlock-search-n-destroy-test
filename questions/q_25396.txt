9)  The two spectra below are both of Nylon-66.  Predict which was from infrared versus Raman.  Note, the top one is just plotted upside-down for comparison of the peak intensities (it does not mean it is transmittance mode).  Match the following marked peaks with their corresponding vibrational modes, and also match which spectrum corresponds to infrared versus Raman.  Top spectrum (Infrared / Raman) [1] Bottom spectrum (Infrared / Raman) [2]

B) Use the codon table provided to write the amino acid sequence of the translated polypeptide. Indicate the N-terminus and C-terminus of this small part. C) Classify the following substitution mutation based on the change in amino acid sequence: 3' TACACCAAATTGATCGTA 5' D) Classify the following substitution mutation based on the change in amino acid sequence: 3' TACACCAATTTGATGGTA 5' E) Classify the following substitution mutation based on the change in amino acid sequence: 3' TACACCAAATTAATGGTA 5'   Bonus points: The codon table includes the 3-letter abbreviations for each amino acid.   1/2  point will be given for each full name and 1-letter abbreviation you can write for each amino acid.

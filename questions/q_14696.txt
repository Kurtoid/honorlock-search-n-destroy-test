Pulmonary capillary beds are the site of _____; while systemic capillary beds are the site of ________.
An ideal silicon PN junction is uniformly doped and has a band diagram is shown below.  Calculate the electron current density (JN) at a position where it is 2 times hole diffusion length (2Lp) from the depletion edge of the n-type quasi-neutral region.  For simplicity, use the electron mobility = 1000 cm2/V-s, the hole mobility  = 450 cm2/V-s, and the minority carrier lifetime is 2x10-6 s (for both electrons and holes.) Your answer should be in the units of A/cm2.      Enter your final answer here:

Fathers:
"The education of women has, of late, been attended to than formerly; yet they are still reckoned a frivolous sex and ridiculed or pitied by the writers who endeavor by satire or instruction to improve them. It is acknowledged that they spend many of the first years of their lives in a smattering of accomplishments; meanwhile strength of body and mind are sacrificed to libertine notion of beauty [...]."

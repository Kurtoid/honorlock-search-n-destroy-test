DIRECTIONS: Choose the correct answer for each question.Cities Beneath the Sea[A] For uncounted generations, trillions upon trillions of coral polyps have lived and died, leaving behind a material called limestone. Prized throughout history, limestone was used to construct the Great Pyramids of Egypt, as well as many churches and castles. Yet the greatest limestone structures in the world are built underwater, by the coral polyps themselves. We call them reefs. They can be even larger in scale than the most impressive buildings and structures made by humans.A Variety of Life[B] Indeed, a living coral reef is remarkable, a "city beneath the sea" filled with a rich variety of life. Most coral reefs can be found in warm, shallow oceans. They occupy just a small part of the ocean floor, but host 25 percent of all ocean life. [C] Coral reefs display nature's most brilliant colors. Each reef is full of colorful fish as well as coral that form wonderful patterns. In addition to their beauty, the reefs are an important food source for fish, and for humans. In fact, reef fish make up a significant percentage of the global fish catch.Threats to Coral Reefs[D] Various human activities can cause great harm to the world's coral reefs. For example, reefs can be damaged when the coral is taken for use in building materials, jewelry-making, or to fill aquariums. [E] Illegal fishing methods like blast and cyanide fishing also harm the reefs. These methods can help fishermen get a good catch, but their negative effects on the reefs are significant. Blast fishing involves setting off bombs in the water to kill as many fish as possible. This kills most living things nearby and causes damage to the reef's structure.[F] In cyanide fishing, fishermen release liquid cyanide - a very dangerous and deadly chemical - into the reef. As a result, the fish become stunned, which makes them easy to collect. Meanwhile, the reef is damaged by the cyanide, which kills large numbers of coral polyps. The reef is also damaged by the fishermen who break it apart looking for the stunned fish. [G] Another threat is water pollution. When floods in Australia covered the Great Barrier Reef with dirty freshwater, the quality of the water changed and chemicals killed the reef life. This is happening to many reefs around the world.[H] In addition, global warming has caused many reefs to become sick. Warmer temperatures have turned them white, in a process known as coral bleaching. A 2018 UN Report predicted that up to 99 percent of the world's coral reefs may decline if global warming continues.Reasons for Hope[I] These threats to coral reefs are very serious, but there is reason to hope that they will survive. If we take steps toward coral reef conservation, it is likely that these tiny creatures - which survived natural threats for millions of years - will be able to rebuild. As conservationist Robert Richmond says, "Given a chance, they can come back." Which is NOT a threat to the coral reefs?

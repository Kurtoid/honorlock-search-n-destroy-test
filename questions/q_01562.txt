Consider a task set t composed of the following three periodic tasks: t1(r0 = 0,C = 5, T = 30) t2(r0 = 0,C = 10, T = 50) t3(r0 = 0,C = 25, T = 75) where r0 is the task release (arrival) time, C is execution time in cycles, and T is the period (also the deadline). Compute the major cycle of the task set. Using the rate monotonic (RM) algorithm, build the schedule and verify the schedulability. (Hint: create the schedule on scratch paper and then specify the schedule information for each task from there)

Microbiota-generated short chain fatty acids (SCFA) have important function in host immune system and are required for gut tissue homeostasis. The data below shows that SCFA could potentiate Foxp3+ Treg cell differentiation.    Figure legend: a) Effect of fecal extracts from SPF, antibiotic-treated (AVNM), or germ-free (GF) mice on in vitro induction of Foxp3 expression in naive CD4+ T cells stimulated with CD3 antibody in the presence of Flt3L-elicited DC and TGF-b. b) HPLC fractionation of 2-nitrophenylhydrazine-HCl derivatized SCFA present in indicated fecal extracts. Red and yellow arrows indicate peaks corresponding to propionate and butyrate, respectively. Internal standard peak is indicated with a star. c) Effect of indicated purified SCFA on in vitro induction of Foxp3 expression in naive CD4+ T cells isolated from B6 or Foxp3GFP mice as described in (a). d) Effect of butyrate on Foxp3 induction in CNS1-sufficient and -deficient naive CD4+ T cells from Foxp3GFP and Foxp3DCNS1 as described in (a). A.  Briefly describe a hypothesis to explain the result showing that CNS1 deletion Tregs failed to respond to SCFA, and how you could test this hypothesis experimentally (focus on the mechanisms covered in the lecture).  (5 points) B.  In addition to their effect on immune cells, SCFA can also affect gut epithelial cells. Please name a human disease due to lack of SCFA in the colon, and briefly explain the disease pathogenesis.  (2 points)

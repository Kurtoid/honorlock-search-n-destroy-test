Define a new type called ClockTime that can be used for storing an amount of time in hours and minutes (both whole numbers). It should also include data about whether the time is AM or PM. The user should be able to construct a ClockTime representing 10:30 AM by writing: ClockTime amount = {10, 30, true}. Write a function called time_after that takes a pointer to a ClockTime and two ints as parameters and returns a pointer to a new ClockTime containing the time it will be if the number of hours (value stored in the first int parameter) and the number of minutes (value stored in the second int parameter) are added to the time in the passed in ClockTime. You can assume the passed in ClockTime will contain a valid time on a 12 hour clock (hours 1 - 12, minutes 0 - 59). Your returned ClockTime should also contain a valid time on a 12 hour clock. You can assume the passed in int representing minutes will be between 0 and 59 and the passed in int representing hours will be between 0 and 24. The passed in hours and minutes summed together will be no more than 24 hours. ClockTime start = {10, 25, true}; ClockTime* end = time_until(&start, 2, 20);  After the above call the variable end should store 12:45 PM ({12, 45, false}). ClockTime start = {10, 25, true}; ClockTime* end = time_until(&start, 10, 45);  After the above call the variable end should store 9:10 PM ({9, 10, false}). ClockTime start = {10, 25, true}; ClockTime* end = time_until(&start, 22, 45);  After the above call the variable end should store 9:10 AM ({9, 10, true}). You may not alter the passed in ClockTime. Remember that 12 PM comes after 11 AM and 12 AM comes after 11 PM.

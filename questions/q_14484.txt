EXHIBIT 3 A craft brewery is planning its production for the summer season. It has assessed demand data for the next three months (see table below). With its current equipment, the company can brew between 18,000 and 26,000 gallons beer per month. The brewery has storage space that can hold maximum 10,000 gallons of beer. The cost of storing beer is $1.10 per gallon per month. The inventory is empty at the beginning and end of the planning period. The brewing cost is estimated at $3.20 per gallon. The brewery wants to find the optimal production schedule that minimizes its total cost. The decision variables are given as: B1 = Number of gallons brewed in Month 1 B2 = Number of gallons brewed in Month 2 B3 = Number of gallons brewed in Month 3 S1 = Number of gallons in inventory at end of Month 1 S2 = Number of gallons in inventory at end of Month 2      Demand Month 1 15,000 gallons   Demand Month 2 21,000 gallons   Demand Month 3 36,000 gallons   Minimum brewing per month 18,000 gallons   Maximum brewing per month 26,000 gallons   Maximum storage capacity per month 10,000 gallons   Brewing cost per gallon 3.20 $/gallon   Storage cost per gallon 1.10 $/gallon      Please solve the problem described in this Exhibit using the Excel Solver.

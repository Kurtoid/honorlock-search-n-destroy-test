We would like to choose the best regression model that predicts violent crime in the U.S.  Models 1, 2, and 3 are shown in the data description file. Use the SAS output provided (below and in the data description) to answer the question.  Mode 3: Crime = b0 + b1 murder + b2 single + b3 pctmetro + b4 poverty + e  Choose the option that best answers the question. I. Model 3 is the best model (among the three models presented) because it is in accordance with all classical assumptions (linearity, endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, and normality of the errors). II. Model 3 should be used because it has higher Adj-R2, lower Se (when compared to models 1 and 2), and all variables are statistically significant at a 5% level.  III. Model 3 should not be used and one of the reasons is that the variable poverty does not explain the variation in crimes.  IV.  The independent variable murder should be transformed to the natural log (of murder) to fix linearity.

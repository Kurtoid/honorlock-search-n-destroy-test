When Mr. Suzuki was 18 years old, he emigrated from his native Japan to accept a scholarship to the University. His culture places a high value on education, and has great respect for teachers, so Mr. Suzuki became a high school math teacher. He retired 6 years ago. Mr. Suzuki values his health and has always kept himself fit, even as he has aged. At 71 years old he is still healthy, even though he does not hear as well as he once did, and sometimes misses auditory cues. One day at the fitness center, he stepped onto a treadmill without realizing that its user had left it running and gone to the bathroom. Mr. Suzuki fell and broke his left hip. He was admitted to Lewis and Clark Hospital for a total hip replacement. The hospital uses a critical care pathway for hip replacements, which calls for a 3 to 4 day length of stay, with specific interventions for each discipline. Yesterday he was evaluated by the supervising OTR. This is day 2 of the critical care pathway. Mr. Suzuki has always been proud of his fitness, and is embarrassed by the idea of being seen using a walker. He places great value on saving face, and does not want friends to see him limping. He is motivated to work hard to avoid re-injury. Mr. Suzuki is unable to dress his lower body because he is not allowed to bend past 70 degrees, internally rotate his right leg, or abduct his thigh after his total hip replacement earlier this week. He does not remember all 3 of his hip precautions, and while he is learning to use adaptive equipment to dress, it is new to him and he is not yet proficient in its use.  The OT has identified two primary problem areas for Mr. Suzuki to be addressed in the intervention plan: He doesn't remember his 3 hip precautions and he still doesn't completely understand how to use the adaptive equipment he was given yesterday.  A third problem might be safety in transitional movements and functional mobility, such as transferring to the toilet, tub, or car. In a short length of stay, there probably wouldn't be more than 2 or 3 problems identified. Mr. Suzuki does not have a memory deficit, nor is he forgetful. This is a man in his 70s just out of hip surgery, trying to master new skills. He would not be expected to get everything 100% correct on his second try. As a payment issue, a third-party payer would be much more interested in paying for additional instruction for something unfamiliar, which could easily be learned with practice, than in trying to combat memory deficits in an older client. 1. What other personal or instrumental ADL tasks (besides dressing) will Mr. Suzuki need to master in order to be safe at home

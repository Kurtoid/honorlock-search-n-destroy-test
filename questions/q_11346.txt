The hypothesis that men in high stress jobs have an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease was tested during an 18-year follow-up study from 2000-2017 of a group of 8,000 men of Japanese ancestry in Hawaii.  Of the 4,500 men with higher stress jobs, 3,000 of them developed CHD; of the 3,500 men with lower stress jobs, 1,800 of them developed CHD.

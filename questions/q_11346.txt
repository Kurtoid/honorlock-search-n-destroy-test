Re: Xia, a social worker, is interested in studying access to mental health care of Hmong refugee older adults. She initiated the translation of a survey instrument designed for English speakers into Hmong.  Afterwards, the instrument was translated back into English by a bilingual student. She also consulted with five bilingual Hmong-American students and asked them what they believe the measure is designed to study and if the questions in the instrument have the same general meaning for Hmong as they would for Americans.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ At the completion of this study, Xia found and reported that the rate of depression is much higher among the Hmong elders relative to the general population of the same age. In the same study, Xia also documented the reluctance of many Hmong adults to seek out help from 'western' mental health professionals, preferring instead to engage in culturally salient rituals. A reviewer of the paper Xia submitted for publication suggested that she should draw a direct link between the "refusal" to access western mental health and depression rates among the Hmong and that she should also recommend ways to encourage the Hmong population to seek help in outpatient mental health clinics. In response, Xia insisted that this would not be a culturally appropriate way to interpret the findings.  Which of the following ethical problems with the reviewer's data interpretation are evident?

Case study #4 Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent causative agent of malaria. This parasite has a trophozoite form that must undergo a life cycle within the gut of the female Anopheles mosquito to be naturally transmitted to the next host. The parasite also has separate trophozoite forms in the liver and blood of humans. If the malaria parasite is introduced into a pregnant woman, it can cross the placental barrier and infect the developing fetus. People at increased risk for malaria infection are children under 5 years old, pregnant women, and people with AIDS (active HIV infection).   True/False: Chloramphenicol, which binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit, would be effective at treating a P. falciparum infection.

As a part of your responsibilities at a research I institution after the doctoral program, you routinely review manuscripts for various journals, conferences, and so forth. One day you came across a manuscript in your review folder that compares the standardized path coefficients of the mediation model using data collected in the US and China. You further noticed that for the measurement model, it used CFA. And then, it switched to the OLS regression analysis to test for the moderation effects. Although the current statistical analysis is acceptable, you believe the moderating effects may be better assessed using an SEM-based multigroup analysis.  Please prepare a constructive comment by describing the assessment procedure of measurement invariance first. Using Steenkamp and Baumgartner (1998), identify all needed steps in carrying out the measurement invariance tests for the study including what to look for in each step according to the authors. (10 points) Please explain the procedure in details to evaluate the significance of the moderating effect on a path coefficient using a multigroup analysis including what to look for by the authors. (10 points) Illustrate potential moderated mediation or mediated moderation including the condition(s) required for one over the other. Please use a simple example in answering this question.

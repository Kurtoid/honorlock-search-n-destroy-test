Assume the operating system for LC-3 has had new service routines added to it. Consider the following code fragment that requests one of those new service routines:  LD R2, B LOOP TRAP x32 ADD R2, R2, #-1  Also consider the following partial service routine jump table:       ADDRESS       CONTENTS      x0031 x0709   x0032 x0527   x0033 x0913   x0034 x0957    A. What address is used by the code above to access the service routine jump table?  [trpaddr]B. What is the starting address of the service routine called by the code above?  [srvaddr]C. If the symbol table shows LOOP is address x320F, what is the return address from the service routine?  [retaddr]D. What is the machine code for the instruction the service routine uses to return to the code above?  [mc] Enter the addresses and the machine code as 4-digit hex values in LC-3 format like the following: x01F3

A population of dark-eyed junco birds became established near the California coastline, many miles from the junco's normal habitat in the mixed-coniferous temperate forests in the mountains. Juncos have white outer tail feathers that the males display during aggressive interactions and during courtship displays. Males with more white in their tail are more likely to win aggressive interactions, and females prefer to mate with males with more white in their tails. The coastal male junco population tails were, on average, 36% white; whereas the tails of males from the mountain populations averaged 40-45% white. Which of the following factors is the most likely original cause of the difference between the populations if the trait is inherited?

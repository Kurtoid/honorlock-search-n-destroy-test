Humans and Animals: An Ancient Partnership 1    The partnership between humans and animals goes back to ancient times. There is evidence that dogs first became companions to humans thousands of years ago. Dogs have always given protection and warmth to people. Sheep, cattle, and pigs were later domesticated as a source of food. Cattle were also used to help with work. It was an important step when humans started to keep horses because they could use the animals for both work and transportation. Thousands of years later, not only does the relationship between humans and animals continue, but it is thriving and developing in new ways. 2    Companionship is, of course, one of the main aspects of this relationship. Almost 50 million households in the United States have dogs as pets. More than 60 million have cats. And then there are all the other types of pets such as birds, fish, and other small animals. It's not surprising that pet ownership is so widespread, since research shows it has clear health benefits. Studies have shown that pets can improve your mood, encourage more exercise, reduce stress, and even lower blood pressure. 3    In addition to keeping humans company, animals play a role in helping people with special needs. Guide dogs for blind people are one of the most well-known examples. During World War I, an American woman named Dorothy Harrison Eustis saw dogs guiding blind veterans in Germany. After that, she decided to start a training school for guide dogs in the U.S. At first, all guide dogs were German shepherds, but now many different breeds are used. 4    This is only one way that dogs assist people with disabilities or special needs. Dogs are also used to help people who can't walk or move easily. The dogs might be trained to pick things up, open or close doors, or turn lights on and off. Dogs can also be trained to accommodate people with many other special needs or medical problems. They can help people who have difficulty socializing. For example, one very shy woman dresses her dog in a costume, which encourages other people to start conversations with her. 5    Many dogs seem to know almost instinctively how to help people, but people also use cats, pigs, miniature horses, and even monkeys as assistance animals. One man uses a bird that talks to him and calms him down when he feels extreme anxiety. There are people who feel suspicion about the range of animals being used. There are even lawsuits about this, but it is unlikely that we will stop using animals to help people. 6    Scientists are also studying how animals behave and interact. They want to understand more about animal intelligence, and possibly learn more about human intelligence too. Research has shown some surprising results. Animals may not be geniuses, but many are more intelligent than people believed. 7    Studies have shown that a variety of animals have some ability to solve problems, use tools, and teach new behaviors to other animals. Elephants and even dolphins have been shown to use tools. Primates such as chimpanzees and gorillas use sticks and stones to hunt for food. Many kinds of birds use tools, too. For example, some birds use sticks to get insects out of trees or stones to crush nuts for food. Crows and seagulls are even more creative. They drop nuts at intersections on the street and wait for cars to run over them and open the nuts. 8    These are only some examples of how animals play a role in human life. There are many other ways that animals contribute to our world. Many see this animal human partnership as a privilege. However, there are factors, such as environmental problems, threatening many animal species these days. Many people think that we humans have an obligation to help animals to protect the special relationship that began thousands of years ago.

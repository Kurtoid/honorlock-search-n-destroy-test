EXTRA CREDIT: You have about 50 potato plants, which are distributed between two greenhouses.  This year, you notice that the potato plants are growing poorly. Upon closer inspection, you notice aphids, which are small insects, crawling all over your plants. While there are several different ways to deal with an aphid infestation, you decide to "experiment" with a biocontrol approach. Biocontrol, or biological control, is an approach to controlling pests using other organisms.  Ladybugs are a known predator of aphids. You go to your favorite nursery and purchase some ladybugs. The next evening you release the ladybugs in both greenhouses.  Some fly away, but the majority take up residence on your plants.  One week later you notice that your plants seem to be much healthier, and there are far fewer aphids on them. Given your experimental set up, is it safe to conclude that ladybugs did the trick and solved your aphid problem? Explain.

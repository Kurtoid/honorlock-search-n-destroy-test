The aquifer that South Florida relies on is a(n) _______ aquifer. This type of aquifer is particularly vulnerable to pollution because its upper surface is not sealed off by an impermeable layer, and thus it can easily be contaminated by runoff or leaks on the Earth's surface.

Which of these given arguments uses the fallacy of affirming the consequent?  [Answer] Argument A:    Proving:  For every real number x, x < x + 1.   Let x be an arbitrary real number. We know that 0 < 1. Adding x to both sides, gives x + 0 < x + 1.    And that gives the equivalent inequality x < x + 1. So for every real number x, x < x + 1.  Argument B:   Proving:  For integers x and y, if xy is a multiple of 5, then x is a multiple of 5 and y is a multiple of 5.  Let x and y be integers with xy a multiple of 5. x is a multiple of 5 means x = 5k, for some integer k. Similarly, y is a multiple of 5 means y = 5j for some integer j. Substituting for x and y, we get xy = (5k)(5j) = 5(5kj).  Since 5kj is an integer, the product xy, which equals 5(5kj), is a multiple of 5. So xy is a multiple of 5, when x is a multiple of 5 and y is a multiple of 5.  Argument C:    Proving: For every positive real number x, x + 1/x >= 2.  Let x be a positive real number with x + 1/x >= 2. Multiplying both sides by x, we have x2 + 1 >= 2x. So by algebra, we get x2 - 2x + 1 >= 0, or (x-1)2 >= 0. Since it is true that the square of any real number is positive, (x-1)2 >= 0 confirms that x + 1/x >= 2, for every positive real number x.  Argument D:  Proving:  For all integers m and n, if m and n are odd, then (m+n) is odd.  Let m and n be integers. We know that when m and n are even, then (m+n) is even. So if m and n are odd, (m+n) is odd.

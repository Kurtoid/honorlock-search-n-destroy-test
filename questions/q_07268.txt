The Soiled Bloomers Venture is a start-up website that will sell potted plants.  They are not sure how well their plants will be received online.  If they get a good market reception in terms of volume, they figure they can sell 100,000 plants per year.  If they get a good market reception in term of price, they will average $10 each.  If they get only moderate reception, they will sell only 75,000 plants and $9.50, respectively.  If they get poor reception, they will sell only 50,000 plants and $9.00 respectively.  They give each scenario an equally likely chance and consider all to be independent of each other.  They know they will have fixed costs of $200,000 per year but are unsure of their variable costs.  If all goes well and their costs are low, the average cost to them per plant will be $5.50.  The most likely cost will be $6.50, but if things go bad, the cost will be $7.50 per plant.   They give each of these possible costs an equally likely chance.

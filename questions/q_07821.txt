A FMS consists of three stations plus a load/unload station. Station 1 loads and unloads parts using one server (material handling worker). Station 2 performs horizontal milling operations with two servers (identical CNC horizontal milling machines). Station 3 performs vertical milling operations with three servers (identical CNC vertical milling machines). Station 4 performs drilling operations with four servers (identical CNC drilling machines). The machines are connected by a part handling system that has four work carriers and a mean transport time of 3.5 min. The FMS produces two parts, A and B, whose part mix fractions and process routings are presented in the table below. The operation frequency fijk = 1.0 for all operations. Find (a) (5 pt) workload (in minutes) for each station (including the material handling), (b) (5 pt) WLi/si ratio for each station (including material handling), (c) (5 pt) the bottleneck station, (d) (5 pt) maximum production rate of the FMS (pc/hr), and (e) (5 pt) utilization (%) of each machine (station) in the system, including material handling.

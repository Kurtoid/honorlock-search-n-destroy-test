A normal distribution with a mean of 25 and standard deviation of 5. What is the corresponding Z score for a case having a value of 10? Z = x your score  - minus m mean / divided by  s standard deviation Example, let's say you have a test score of 190. The test has a mean (m) of 150 and a standard deviation. (s) of 25. Assuming a normal distribution, your z score would be:z = (x - m) / sz = 190 - 150 / 25 = 1.6.

After reading the paragraph below, answer the questions that follow.Desert pupfish live in springs of the American Southwest. Today, there are about 30 species of pupfish, but they all evolved from a common Pleistocene ancestor. The southwestern United States was once much wetter than it is now, and the Pleistocene pupfish flourished over a wide geographic area. Over thousands of years, however, the Sierra Nevada mountain range was pushed upward by geological forces, blocking rainfall from the Pacific Ocean. As the large lakes dried up, small groups of pupfish remained in springs and pools fed by groundwater seepage. Now, although many of these small springs still have pupfish, each population, through evolution, has become very different from populations of pupfish in other springs.Which of the following statements represents a probable explanation for differences among pupfish populations?

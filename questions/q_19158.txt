The physician has ordered Lasix (furosemide) 40mg IVP.  Your patient has D5NS infusing.  The D-R-C for this medication is:  (See following pages from IV med book)      Dilution:  Rate:  Compatibility:               Furosemide  (fur-OH-seh-myd) Lasix Diuretic (loop) pH 8 to 9.3 Usual dose Adjust dose and dose schedule to individual patient needs. Reserve parenteral therapy for emergent situations or for patients unable to take oral therapy. Switch to oral therapy as soon as practical.   Edema: 20 to 40 mg. May be repeated in 2 hours. If necessary, increase dosage by 20-mg increments (under close medical supervision and no sooner than 2 hours after previous dose) until desired diuresis is obtained. ACC/AHA 2009 guidelines for heart failure recommend a maximum single dose of 160 to 200 mg. If larger doses are required, may be given as an infusion at a rate not to exceed 4 mg/min. When high-dose parenteral therapy is elected for CHF, the ACC/AHA 2009 guidelines recommend a 40-mg IV loading dose followed by an infusion of 10 to 40 mg/hr. After the initial diuresis the minimum effective dose may be given once or twice every 24 hours as required for maintenance.   Dose adjustments Higher doses may be required in renal insufficiency and acute or chronic renal failure. # Reduced dose or extended intervals may be appropriate in the elderly. # Extend dosing intervals in neonates because half-life is prolonged.   Dilution May be given undiluted. May be given through Y-tube or three-way stopcock of infusion set. Not usually added to IV solutions, but large doses may be added to NS, LR, D5W, D5NS and given as an infusion. pH of solution must be over 5.5. Some sources recommend protecting diluted solutions from light to prevent photodegradation (minimized at pH 7).   Rate of administration IV injection: Each 40 mg or fraction thereof should be given over 1 to 2 minutes.  Infusion for Adults: 0.1 mg/kg/hr.

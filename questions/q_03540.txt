Order the steps involved in a possible semi supervised training iteration with cross-view/ augmentation assuming we do everything sequentially   Train the model on labelled set of examples Initialize a model with random weights.  Predict using the model on a weakly augmented unlabelled sample with class scores P1 Predict using the model on a strongly augmented unlabelled sample with class scores P2 Using P1 as the true distribution and P2 as the predicted distribution, use a KL divergence loss to train the model.  Using P2 as the true distribution and P1 as the predicted distribution, use a KL divergence loss to train the model.

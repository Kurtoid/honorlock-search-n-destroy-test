Write a function called springBreak() that takes in one parameter: a dictionary of activities. Each key is a spring break activity (str) that maps to a list of people (str) who want to do the activity. The function should return a tuple with the most popular activity (str) as the first element and the number of people who signed up for that activity (int) as the second element. Popularity is determined by how many people signed up for each activity. Note: Two activities will never have the same number of people signed up.   Example Output #1: >>> actDict = {"sleepover": ["Peter", "Raj"], "beach day": ["Michael", "Caitlin", "Arushi"], "cook out": ["Parul", "Alexa", "Craig", "Fareeda"]}>>> springBreak(actDict)("cook out", 4)  Example Output #2: >>> actDict = {"escape room": ["Arvin", "Anthony"],"ultimate frisbee": ["Arvin", "Alex", "Brian"], "mario kart": ["Alexa"]}>>> springBreak(actDict)("ultimate frisbee", 3)

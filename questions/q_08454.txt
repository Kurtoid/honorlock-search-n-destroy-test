This same study from the last question is for this question: Canadian and Swiss researchers wanted to know if the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was important to the productivity of grasslands (M.G.A. van der Heijden, J. N. Klironomos, M. Ursic, P. Moutoglis, R. Streitwolf-Engel, T. Boler, A. Wiemken, and I. R. Sanders. 1998. Mycorrhizal fungal diversity determines plant biodiversity, ecosystem variability, and productivity. Nature 396:69-72). Specifically, they wanted to know if it mattered which specific AMF species were present, or just that some type of AMF was present. They grew various plants in combination with one of four AMF species (A, B, C, and D), no AMF species (O), or all four AMF species together (A + B + C + D); and they measured plant growth under each set of conditions. All plant species were grown in each plot, so they always competed with each other, with the only difference being which AMF species were present. On the graphs below, the x-axis labels indicate the number and identity of AMF species (bar 0 = no fungi; bars A - D = individual AMF species; bar A + B + C + D = all AMF species together). The y-axis indicates the amount (grams) of plant biomass for the species shown in italics above each graph.  Examine the effect of AMF species on Sanguisorba officinalis. Which of the following conclusions can be correctly drawn from the data?

On May 1, Bob the Barkeep places an order by telephone for 2000 cases of various dry beers at $17/case for immediate delivery.  The sales manager at Larry's Liquors takes the order.  Bob follows up on the phone call by filling out a written order form, confirming the sale that had been negotiated over the phone.  He faxes the form to Larry's Liquors. On May 3, Larry himself writes back to Bob.  Larry is sorry to have to report that all of his dry beer stocks are already committed to other customers, and so he would have to order more.  It will take at least two months for a delivery, and because demand for dry beer is spiking, it will cost more like $25/case. Assume now that Larry forgot to write back to Bob but instead had left it on his to-do list for three weeks. In the meantime, Bob has been buying dry beer from other distributors for $32/case. If Bob were to sue Larry for breach of contract, what result?
10.  Which of the following questions should not be asked in a job interview?
Some marine snails (species L) produce large numbers of small eggs that are shed into the sea, hatch at an early stage of development, and feed on microscopic plants. Other marine snails (species S) produce few eggs that are retained for a long time within the body of the mother snail in a brood pouch, hatch at an advanced stage of development, and immediately begin to feed on the surfaces of large plants like the adults. A biologist discovers approximately equal numbers of adults of species L and S in the same area over many generations. While studying the two species of snails, the biologist hypothesizes that the two species expend approximately the same amount of energy producing young. What assumption is the biologist making?

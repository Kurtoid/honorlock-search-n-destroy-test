In distributed systems, clients and services run on different nodes and access control decisions require that sources of requests present verifiable statements that show that their requests do satisfy desired access control. Assume that a system has three principals, Alice, Bob and Charlie, and a service S. For this system, answer the following questions.    First, consider the process of setting up a secure communication channel C having a shared key K. This channel is set up between Alice's node and the node where S runs. A node is principal M as OS, where M is the machine and it is booted with operating system OS. Assume messages sent over C are encrypted with key K. If S can successfully decrypt a message R  it receives with key K, it can be concluded that M as OS says R, where R is the statement contained in the message that comes over C.  Give examples of two protocols discussed in class and the statements generated when they are executed which allow S to conclude that the request does come from Alice's node. (10 pts.)  Service S provides access to files and a certain file F can be read by principal (Alice [?] Bob). If Charlie wants to read F, what credentials (statements and evidence that allows S to verify their validity) must Charlie provide to S?  (5 pts.)  (a) Alice and Bob do not want Charlie to access files other than F that are accessible to (Alice [?] Bob). Is this the case with the credentials that Charlie presents to S in 2.2 (previous question)?  (5 pts.) (b) If your answer is no, is there another way to specify access control rules for F such that credentials issued for accessing it do not grant access to other files that can be accessed by (Alice [?] Bob)? In this case, describe both the access rule for F and the credentials that Charlie will now require to gain access to F. (5 pts.)  A malicious principal Eve is able to convince service S to grant its request to access F when access control is defined as in 2.2. List at least two attacks that would allow Eve to do this successfully. For full credit, describe the targets of attack and what happens as the result of these attacks (e.g., stolen keys, compromised system etc.). If any information is stolen by Eve as a result of these attacks, explain what it is and how it is used to gain access to F? (10 pts.)

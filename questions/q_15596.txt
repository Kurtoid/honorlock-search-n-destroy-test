Does spending time online lead to greater unhappiness and if so, are these effects different for men and women? To investigate this question, a researcher administers a depression inventory to a group of 60 individuals. The researcher divides these participants into three groups of low, medium, and high screen time based on data collected from their smartphones and compares the data from the male and female participants. The appropriate statistical test is a(n):

The sumabs() function below returns the sum of the absolute values of the two arguments.  Assume that there exists an abs() function that returns the absolute value of the argument it receives.  Translate the sumabs() function to MIPS assembly, where the first three lines of the translation are given below.  Your code should follow the MIPS calling conventions presented in class. Consider the following MIPS calling convention issues when translating the sumabs() function to MIPS assembly. (a) Which registers are used to pass arguments? (b) Which registers need to be used so their values are guaranteed to be preserved across calls?  For instance, the value of y needs to be preserved across the first call to abs() and the value of a needs to be preserved across the second call to abs(). (c) Which register is used to hold the return value? (d) Which register is used to hold the return address? int subabs(int x, int y){ int a, b; a = abs(x); b = abs(y); return a+b;} .text .globl sumabssumabs:

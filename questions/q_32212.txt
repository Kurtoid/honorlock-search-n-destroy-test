Gerard Yoder believes that every time he picks up his daughter, Penny, from school, it brings him good luck. The last time he picked her up from school, he won a lottery ticket. Today, after he received her from school, he reached his office and found out that he has been promoted. Which of the following concepts best describes Yoder's belief?
Which cranial nerves are responsible for normal eye movements (i.e. physiologic nystagmus)?
You have just finished the design of the steel cables for a suspension bridge, when your UGA project manager comes into your office and informs you that he forgot to account for the vehicles.  Now the weight requirement for the bridge has increased by 2x and the cables you initially chose will plastically deform under the load.  Which of the following could be done to fix your design?  i. Choose a cable with a smaller diameter. ii. Use the same cable size but choose a material with a higher elastic modulus. iii. Use the same cable size but choose a material with a higher yield strength.
The following is a picture of what type of circuit?

To switch from membrane bound antibodies to secreted antibodies, _______________________
The total free-energy change for a chemically related series of reactions equals the:
Expression of adenylate cyclase (encoded by the cya gene) and CAP (encoded by the crp gene) is essential for expression of all catabolite-sensitive operons. In your studies, you are interested in isolating strains containing mutations in either cya or crp. To do so, you utilize the tetrazolium salt selection method in which bacterial colonies only appear red when they cannot ferment the carbon source supplied in the plate. Your assistant mutagenizes some bacteria and spreads them on plates containing maltose as a carbon source and tetrazolium salts. He identifies red colonies which he thinks likely have mutations in cya or crp genes. Given your infinite wisdom in bacterial genetics, you tell him you aren't so sure. Explain 1) what one alternative explanation for what his red colonies could be, if it isn't due to cya or crp mutations? Also, 2) what should he do to enrich for cya or crp mutants and how can he be certain they are cya or crp mutants once he selects colonies?
What determines whether blood is bright red or a dull, dark red?

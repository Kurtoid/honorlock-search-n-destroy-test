For the following questions, you can either type your solution below (in the textbox) or write it on a number of papers, take pictures of the papers at the end of the exam and upload it through the link provided below.   (5 points) Consider a raster system with resolution of 1680 by 1050. What size frame buffer (in bytes) is needed if the full RGBA system is used to store the color of each pixel? (15 points) In the following image, the background is white (first layer). The second layer is the circle which is colored by blue color with alpha = 0.5. The third layer is the square which is colored by green color with alpha = 0.3. Finally, the fourth layer is a heart shape colored by red with alpha = 0.6.

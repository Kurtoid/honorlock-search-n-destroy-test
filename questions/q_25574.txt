The Weissman Corporation is a medical lab in Tampa, Florida that is considering entering into a contract with the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) to test people for COVID -19. If they are to enter into this contract, they will have to purchase additional equipment that will be depreciated using a five-year MACRS schedule.  Based on the guidelines as proposed by the CDC, the following estimates were generated.  Cost of the equipment: $4,000,000 Revenues: $2,100,000 for the first year, then decreasing by $50,000 per year for the five-year evaluation period. Operations will cease at the end of the five-year period. The equipment will be depreciated using a MACRS over a five-year period with no salvage value. The five-year MACRS is as follows:      Year   0   1   2   3   4   5     Depreciation   20%   32%   19.2%   11.52%   11.52%   5.76%      Variable costs, including supplies, technicians, maintenance etc. is expected to be 45% of revenues. Weissman's tax rate is 40%. Prior to beginning operations as a testing facility, working capital in the amount of $50,000 will be invested into supplies of PPE and other supplies to keep the labs operational. There will be NO additional working capital needs during the five-year project, however, the $50,000 in working capital will be returned at the end of the five-year project.  Weissman's cost of capital is estimated to be 8%. Based on this, what is the project's NPV?

Re: A study seeks to understand the impact of a stigmatized label (i.e. ADHD) on children's social behavior.  For this study, the following laboratory research situation was set up:  Researchers recruited a total of 40 fifth grade students who were told to complete a task together with another peer. All of the participants were told that the focus of observation was to examine their task performance. One half of the participants were randomly assigned to Condition A which involved students being told that a "peer" (Alex) has been diagnosed with ADHD in the past year (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder--a stigmatizing condition). The other half of participants in Condition B were told that Alex has had an appendix surgery in the past year (a non-stigmatizing condition). Alex, a 5th grader who was actually part of the research team, was instructed to behave in the same way with each participant (Alex was unaware of the purpose of the research). Based on Labeling Theory, the study hypothesis was that children who think that their play partner has ADHD would be less friendly and less cooperative toward their play-partner relative to peers told that the play partner had appendix surgery. Three research assistants were trained on a coding system (codes with definitions) to assess the children's level of friendliness and cooperativeness. Then, they were asked to independently observe the behavior of child participants behind a one-way mirror and code in the following way: Friendliness: (1) friendly (2) somewhat friendly and (3) unfriendly Cooperativeness: (1) cooperative (2) somewhat cooperative and (3) uncooperative ---------------------------------------------------------------- This study involved some deception of the 5th grade participants. When research requires deception, all of the following are typically required of researchers EXCEPT:

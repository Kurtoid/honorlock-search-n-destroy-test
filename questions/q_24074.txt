Directions:  There are seven errors in this paragraph where the verbs do not agree with their subjects.  Type the problematic verb in the box provided and then fix the verb in the box that asks you to fix it.  You do NOT need to retype the entire sentence.  Simply supply the corrected verb.   Paragraph:        There is either thoughtlessness or cruelty in hurting someone's feelings.  Spite, jealousy, and anger often prompt a person to lash out at another.  Such behavior is deliberate and open.  Children, who are less skilled in handling their emotions than adults are, can be cruel to another child.  There is times when one four-year-old may call another "stupid" or "disgusting" while both children plays a game on the street.  The speaker is simply venting his or her rage and soon forgets, but the victim shamed in front of other children may not forget.  Adult cruelty are more sophisticated.  This cruelty can be the critical remark a box make to an employee or the constant sarcasm of a wife speaking to her husband.  Habitual cruelty often turns into thoughtless cruelty.  When on person constantly belittles another, the victim suffer with every repetition of the meanness, but the attacker feels very little.  Another kind of thoughtless cruelty is the assignment of a nickname.  A man often cringes for years because some childhood "buddies" was too eager to call him "Moose" or "Skinny," and the nickname stuck.  Although adults may try to laugh about their nicknames, neither the intentionally cruel names or a thoughtlessly assigned name is a person's choice.  In all stages of life, people need to show a little kindness and restraint.  Not only the child on the playground, but also adults in all their interactions deserves some of that kindness.

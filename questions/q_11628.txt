In the absence of a catalyst, a reaction has an activation energy of [kJ] kJ/mole. In the absence of the catalyst, the reaction has an activation energy of 22.5 kJ/mole. Calculate the n-fold increase in reaction rate achieved by this catalyst (i.e. the catalytic power) at a physiological temperature of 37o C (or 310 K). Express your answer in decimal notation rounded to three significant figures (write zeros after the number you would underline as the last significant figure). HINT: pay attention to the activation energy units!

Read the lab description and answer questions 1-7 Jack was tasked with determining which brand of pen is most likely to attract a termite. He selected 5 brands of black ink pen, Bic, Precision V5, Sharpie, Papermate, Pilot, plus a pencil. Jack knows from previous experience that the termites are attracted to ink from a black Bic pen and are not attracted to lead from a pencil. To complete the experiment Jack drew a 7 cm diameter circle with each pen and placed a termite 0.25 cm from each circle. He then gave the termite 60 seconds to find the circle and travel around the circle. Jack defined positive results as a termite finding the circle within 60 seconds and then following the circle at least half way around. A negative result would be a termite that was unable to find the circle within 60 seconds or a termite that found the circle but followed it for less than half the circle. Jack tested ten termites on each brand of pen for a total of sixty termites. The results of Jack's experiment are found in the table below. Table 1: Number of termites that found the black 7 cm diameter circle within 60 seconds and then followed the circle for at least half the total distance.

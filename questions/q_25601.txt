You wish to detect when the mouse is moved into a graphical component. Which methods of the MouseListener interface will provide this information?
In the dark zone of the germinal center, __________________.
The nurse is discussing effectiveness rates of different contraceptives with a group of young women. In order to provide the best information, the nurse should include:
Two boxes are connected by a cord running over a pulley. Box 1 has a mass of 7.0 kg and box 2 has a mass of 4.0 kg. The coefficient of kinetic friction between box 1 and the table is 0.25. We ignore the mass of the cord and the pulley and any friction of the pulley and the cord does not stretch. What is the tension of the cords (which is the same for both boxes)?
In a cost-volume-profit graph,

You are cell biologist interested in the regulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, whose pathway components are frequently mutated in cancer cells. EGF stimulates the EGF Receptor (EGFR), which is a receptor tyrosine kinase. You compare how skin cells cultured from a healthy skin sample versus those derived from a skin tumor respond to long term stimulation with the EGF ligand. You lyse the cells at the indicated time points, with and without EGF stimulation, and western blot with antibodies reacting with phosphorylated EGFR, pan-EGFR or Actin. From the below figure, in the box provided  please succinctly answer (1-5 sentences each) : A. What is the likely mechanism of regulation of normal EGFR in response to long-term EGF stimulation? B. Propose a hypothesis as to the molecular basis of why the mutant EGFR behaves differently and why this behavior may contribute to the tumorigenesis.

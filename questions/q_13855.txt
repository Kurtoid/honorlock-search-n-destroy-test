Dr. Alexander is working on a study to see if Dr. Rodriguez's famous Sunshine pills cure Netflix addiction. With an alpha of 0.05, her null hypothesis is that there is no difference between those taking and not taking Sunshine pills (control group) on Netflix addiction. Her alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference between the two groups in Netflix addiction. To assess Netflix addiction, she employed the Rose Netflix Addiction (RNA) test. There were 20 participants in the Sunshine pills group and 21 participants in the control group. Her results were t=2.123. Based on the critical value for this test, what would you conclude? Note that to get any credit on this item you have to know what the appropriate test is, what the appropriate alternative hypothesis is for selecting the appropriate critical value. You have to know what degrees of freedom to use. We are not using the complicated equation to calculate the degrees of freedom. Thus there is only one correct answer.
Which of the following gives the polar form of the equation above?

For a sample of 40 eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, duration time in seconds and height of the eruptions in feet were recorded.     A. Assume that the graph duration/height seems linear and the correlation coefficient is r = - 0.687. Check at the 0.05 significance level if there is actually a linear correlation between the duration and the height of the eruptions?      B. In the same situation, if the correlation coefficient is r=0.321,  is there a linear correlation between the duration  and the height of the eruptions?  Perform the same test for a 0.01 level of significance.

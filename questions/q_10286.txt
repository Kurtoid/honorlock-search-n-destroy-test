Answer one only of the essays in this last section. Remember to map out the argument you intend to pursue, and support your claims therein with specific references to the examples that verify your thesis. Take note: the quotes below are here to suggest themes or issues, not to serve as the only thing about which you write. -------------------------- Essay Question 1 "O believers, fear Allah as he should be feared...Hold on firmly together to the rope of God, and be not divided among yourselves, and remember the favors God bestowed on you when you were one another's foe and he reconciled your hearts, and you turned into brethren through his grace...So let there be one community among you who may call to the good, enjoin what is esteemed and forbid what is odious...--Qur'an, S. 2: 142-3 The Actual Question: From its inception, Islam has assumed and mandated the umma, the united community of believers, as a legitimization of Muhammad's message and an indictment of other, fractured faiths. What was the historical nature (and reality) of this community in the early days of Islam?  In other words, have we seen historical evidence that verifies or problematizes this picture of the umma? --------------------------- Essay Question 2   "By relying on the Qur'an and the traditions of the Prophet, along with our understanding of the cultural milieu in which Muhammad was born and in which his message was formed, we can more reasonably reconstruct the origins and evolution of Islam. This is no easy task, though it is made somewhat easier by the fact that Muhammad appears to have lived "in the full view of history," to quote Ernst Renan, and died an enormously successful prophet." --Reza Aslan The Actual Question: One of the issues we have repeatedly brushed up against is the very historicity of Islam's foundation stories, as preserved for us in the Qur'an and various hadith.  With reference to specific events, people, or other phenomena, how confident are you that we can read through religious and miraculous texts to get at underlying historical realities of Islam's early days?  Remember: build your argument on specific evidence.

A [m]-kg box travels to the left with a constant speed v0 = [v0] m/s over a section or rollers. It contacts the spring (with k = [k] N/m), where it is also now subject to friction between the box and the surface. The kinetic friction force has a constant magnitude of [fk] N. After first contacting the spring, how far will the box travel before it comes to rest? Write your numerical answer below and show all of your work (with final units) on your written work.

Desert pupfish live in springs of the American Southwest. Today there are about 30 species of pupfish, but they all evolved from a common Pleistocene ancestor. The southwestern United States was once much wetter than it is now, and the Pleistocene pupfish flourished over a wide geographic area. Over thousands of years, however, the Sierra Nevada mountain range was pushed upward by geological forces, blocking rainfall from the Pacific Ocean. As the large lakes dried up, small groups of pupfish remained in springs and pools fed by groundwater seepage. Now, although many of these small springs still have pupfish, each population, through evolution, has become very different from populations of pupfish in other springs.

At a given point in a capillary bed, you find the following values: Blood hydrostatic pressure = 32mmHg Interstitial hydrostatic pressure = 0mmHg Blood colloid osmotic pressure = 14mmHg Interstitial colloid osmotic pressure is 7mmHg   Based on these values, you determine that the net hydrostatic pressure is [blank1]. The net colloid osmotic pressure is [blank2]. Therefore, [blank3] is occurring at a pressure of [blank4]. This point in the capillary bed is most likely closer to the [blank5] end of the capillary bed

"Ain't I A Woman" by Sojourner Truth  Well, children, where there is so much racket there must be something out of kilter. I think that 'twixt the negroes of the South and the women at the North, all talking about rights, the white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what's all this here talking about? That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place. And ain't I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain't I a women? I could work as much and eat as much as a man - when I could get it - and bear the lash as well! And ain't I a woman? I have borne thirteen children, and seen most sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain't I a woman? Then they talk about this thing in the head; what's this they call it? ["intellect," someone whispers.] That's it, honey. What's that got to do with women's rights or negro's rights? If my cup won't hold but a pint, and yours holds a quart, wouldn't you be mean not to let me have my little half measure full? Then that little man in black there, he says women can't have as much rights as men, 'cause Christ wasn't a woman! Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him. If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back, and get it right side up again! And now they is asking to do it, the men better let them. Obliged to you for hearing me, and now old Sojourner ain't got nothing more to say.   From where do the allusions in the passage come?

Application Question 1:  Background The area of Painted Paradise Resort and Spa that generates the most revenue is the hotel. The hotel has rooms that range from nice individual rooms to an exclusive grand villa suite. Hotel management must track all aspects of a reservation including special requests for items such as a crib. The hotel also has to track room charges that guests have made. Room rates vary according to size, season, demand, and discount. The hotel has discounts for typical groups, such as AARP. You have been asked to create several queries that will help management with decision making.   Download and save the file below. Question1.accdb   Steps to Perform: Step 1. (0.5 points) Save the file as Question1_FirstLast using your first and last name.  Step 2. (6 points) Use the data in tblReservations and tblRoomCharges to create a query that lists all reservations, the guest's room service and restaurant charges, and calculates a mandatory gratuity. The query results should display ReservationID, CheckInDate, ChargeCategory, ChargeAmount, and a calculated field named TotalCharge in that order. Sort in Ascending order by CheckInDate. TotalCharge should be calculated using the ChargeAmount field and a gratuity of 18% of ChargeAmount. Format the TotalCharge field as Currency. Save the query as qryStep2. Step 3. (12 points) Use the data in tblReservations and tblGuests to create a query that lists the guests who reside in AK, MT, or IA, and who will be paying between $300 and $400 for their room. The query results should display GuestFirstName, GuestLastName, Address, City, State, ZipCode, CheckInDate, and RoomRate in that order. Sort in Ascending order by CheckInDate. The front desk employees would like to be able to see which customers will be arriving in two weeks so they can call the guest and confirm the reservation. Create a new field named RSVPCallDate that calculates the date that is 14 days before the scheduled CheckInDate (use a function). Save the query as qryStep3. Step 4. (6 points) Create a query based on the tblGuest table that will display the GuestFirstName, GuestLastName, and Address, in that order. The return of the query should include guests whose last names begin with letters A through M. Sort the results in Ascending order by LastName. Save the query as qryStep4. Step 5. (9 points) Use the data in tblReservations and tblGuests to create a query that determines the discount that qualifying customers will receive. The query results should list ReservationID, GuestFirstName, GuestLastName, and DiscountType, in that order. Add a calculated field named DiscountPCT that displays the percentage that qualifying customers will have deducted from their bill when they check out.  If customers have an AAA discount, return the text 10% off. If customers have an AARP discount, return the text 15% off. If customers have a Military discount, return the text 18% off. If they do not receive a discount, then display No Discount in the field.  Save your query as qryStep5.  Upload your Question1 file (with answers) to this question.

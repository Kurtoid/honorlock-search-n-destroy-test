Given the individual reaction orders for all substances and the overall reaction order from the following rate law:    rate = k [ A ] / [ B] By what factor does the rate change if each of the following changes occur? [1]  [ A ] is tripled; [2] [ A ] is doubled and [ B ] is halved? [3]  [ A ] is halved and [ B ] is halved?
24-26) Use the text below to answer questions 24-26.  Glenn is a psychologist interested in the relationship between sleep and academic performance.  Glenn recruits 200 participants for a study.  All the participants are asked to watch a one-hour lecture on the formation of stars.  They're told to pay careful attention to the lecture because they'll have to take a test on the material the next day.   He then randomly divides the participants into 5 groups that differ in how much sleep they're allowed to get that night (the participants come to the lab to sleep; they're woken up after they get their assigned amount of sleep and then not allowed to sleep anymore).     Group 1: 1 hour of sleep  Group 2: 2 hours of sleep  Group 3: 3 hours of sleep  Group 4: 4 hours of sleep  Group 5: 5 hours of sleep    The next morning, the participants take a 50-question test on the formation of stars.   When Glenn plots his data, he sees the following results:  24) What type of study has Glenn conducted?

Which answer is the topic sentence of the following passage? 1Today American Gothic pervades our popular culture.  2Caricatures of the plain and nameless couple wish us well on anniversary cards or sell us cereal and cars on television.  3On dental hygiene posters the man holds a toothbrush instead of a pitchfork, urging us to brush our teeth; when the woman holds the pitchfork, she speaks for women's liberation.  4In political cartoons the rural couple becomes the nation's first family, posed in front of the White House rather than a tiny farmhouse.  5On homemade cards, husbands with wives, boyfriends with girlfriends, fathers with daughters, stand holding pitchforks, babies or drinks, against bungalows, ranch houses or churches.  6In short, American Gothic has become an infinitely variable mirror in which Americans can see themselves.  7It has become a collective self-portrait, one which haunts and entertains us.
Module 8 - Attributions & Self-Efficacy: Question: Currently, Elisa would best be described as having ______ in soccer. Elisa's Back Story: Elisa plays soccer at an extremely high level. She currently travels almost year round to play in elite U17 tournaments, is actively being recruited by the best soccer programs in the country, and is a part of U.S. soccer's developmental program. Recently she was even called up for an international friendly for the U17 U.S. Women's National Team. When you are meeting with Elisa, she makes a comment one day: "I want so desperately to make the U.S. national team, and I know I have to prove I am the best in my position at every tournament. I hate losing, and I hate failing so much that at times I allow myself to become consumed with trying not to fail. When I do fail, I blame myself. It's starting to happen so frequently at tournaments I'm beginning to think this is as far as I will go and I've reached the max of my abilities. Fortunately, I'm doing great in school so at least I am still on track to go to a good college and eventually become a doctor."

Activity Diagram Exercise (10 points): Draw an activity diagram for the following budget monitoring system scenario. Departments send spending requests to the management, who validate these requests. While the management is validating the request, both allocated budget (for this expenditure classification) as well as the availability of any special funding for this class of expense is checked concurrently. If either of these checks turns out to be positive, the funding source is identified and funding is made available. Once request validation and funding availability are both successful, the process proceeds to the next step. If the requested amount is less than $100, funding approval notice is sent to the requesting department. However, if the amount is at least $100, the management forwards the request for special approval. Once this is approved, funding approval notice is sent to the requesting department. If the special approval request is denied, funding denial notice is sent to the requesting department. Similarly, funding denial notice is sent when request validation fails.

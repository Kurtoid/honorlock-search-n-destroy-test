QUESTION ONE (25 minutes)In May of 2019, Defendant hosted a party at a lake house he owned, in honor of the graduation of his son ("Son") from a small, local college. The party was open to any member of Son's class, and their guests. Defendant provided a keg of beer and a variety of other alcoholic beverages. During the party, alcohol was consumed by some attendees who were below the jurisdiction's legal drinking age. Defendant has been charged with violation of section 856 of the criminal code of Anhedonia (a hypothetical jurisdiction located in the United States). Section 856 provides: It is unlawful for any person to serve or permit to be served alcoholic beverages to persons under 21 years of age, or to permit a person under 21 years of age to consume such beverages on their premises. Anyone convicted of violating this provision is guilty of a misdemeanor crime of the second degree, punishable by a fine of up to $10,000, and/or a sentence of imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Defendant acknowledges that he was aware that some persons in attendance at the party were still college students (not graduates), but claims that he was not aware of the ages of all of the attendees, nor was he aware that anyone under 21 was drinking. Section 856 of the Anhedonia Criminal Code was enacted in 2005, as part of a broader set of statutory provisions passed by the Anhedonia legislature that authorized, for the first time in Anhedonia, potential legal liability for providers of alcohol. Prior to 2005, social hosts could not be held responsible, criminally or civilly, for harms related to a guest's consumption of alcohol on the host's premises. A. Assuming the truth of Defendant's statements, and applying the background interpretive principles of the common law, would Defendant possess the necessary mens rea to violate SS856? Explain. (15) B. How, if at all, would your analysis of Question 1A change if you apply instead the interpretive principles of the Model Penal Code? Explain. (10)  Some of the attendees were Son's friends who were still in college, aged 19 and 20.  None of the party attendees were below the age of 19.

Problem 3. (15 points) A semi-elliptic leaf spring undergoes cyclic loading F such that Fmax = 1 kN and Fmin = -1/3 kN. The leaf spring consists of two full-length leaves and eight graduated length leaves. The total length of the spring is 1 m (i.e., 2xL=1 m). The width and thickness of the leaves are 50 mm and 10 mm, respectively. The material properties of the spring are Sut = 80 N/mm2 and Syt = 65 N/mm2. The corrected endurance limit is Se = 40 N/mm2 and the strength at N=103 is 0.9xSut. Determine the life of the leaf spring. Write down the obtained life of the spring. [answer_life]

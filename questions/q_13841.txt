For example, calcium reacts as follows: 2Ca(s) + O2(g) [?] 2CaO(s) You wish to calculate the mass (g) of calcium oxide that can be prepared from 4.20 g of Ca (MM = 40.08 g/mol) and 2.80 g of O2 (MM = 32.00 g/mol). Which is the limiting reactant? How many grams of CaO (MM = 56.08 g/mol) can be produced? How many grams are left of the excess reactant? If 5.00 g of CaO were obtained, what is the percent yield of the reaction? Must show your work on scratch paper to receive credit.

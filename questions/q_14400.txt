Migrating Mice In the last 30 years, mild winters have become much more common in Michigan, the white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), which has significantly increased its northward range. This has caused dramatic changes in populations of endemic woodland deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus graciles), which are typically found in Michigan's more northern latitudes and share an ecological niche with the white-footed mice.       Use this information and your knowledge about biology to answer questions 41-45.   41. White-footed mice could be described as a generalist species.

The following experiment is used for the following question.   A researcher discovered a species of moth that lays its eggs on oak trees. Eggs are laid at two distinct times of the year: early in spring when the oak trees are flowering and in midsummer when flowering is past. Caterpillars from eggs that hatch in spring feed on oak flowers and look like oak flowers, but caterpillars that hatch in summer feed on oak leaves and look like oak twigs.   How does the same population of moths produce such different-looking caterpillars on the same trees? To answer this question, the biologist caught many female moths from the same population and collected their eggs. He put at least one egg from each female into eight identical cups. The eggs hatched, and at least two larvae from each female were maintained in one of the four temperature and light conditions listed below.       Temperature   Day Length     Springlike   Springlike     Springlike   Summerlike     Summerlike   springlike     Summerlike   summerlike       In each of the four environments, one of the caterpillars was fed oak flowers, the other oak leaves. Thus, there were a total of eight treatment groups (4 environments x 2 diets).   Recall that in the experiment, caterpillars born in the spring looked like flowers, and caterpillars born in the summer looked like twigs. What is the most likely selective advantage for this difference in body shape?

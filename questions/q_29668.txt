"Blue Laws" are the name given to the regulation of commerce for religious reasons. These often involved forbidding commercial or recreational activities on Sundays. Many of these laws were abolished mid-to-late 20th century - not because they were unconstitutional but because they were unwanted.

Assembly requires that people have time off together, so it doesn't work to simply mandate that businesses close for any random 24-hour period, because that doesn't ensure that people have time off together." What are the likely effects of a reintroduction of Blue Laws on the religious marketplace? Explain.

While she still enjoys the game, she feels like something is changing in her approach to the game. Sarah tells her Sport Psychology Consultant that: "Sometimes I find myself so focused on my own performance, I know I lose sight of being a good teammate.

I know I should communicate better because my coach keeps encouraging me to lead (she even made me a captain), but I just want to focus on me and executing my job. Don't get me wrong, I love hanging out with my teammates after practice and competitions, but we're just not firing on all cylinders on the court."

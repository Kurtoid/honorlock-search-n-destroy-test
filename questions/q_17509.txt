You are an extension agent and you have been asked by a sheep producer to evaluate two approaches to improving grease fleece weight. You and the producer agree that grease fleece weight is the trait of primary economic importance in his/her business. The producer would like to either select his/her animals either on grease fleece weight directly or weaning weight as a lamb. This large operation produces its own sires that are used in natural service. Males and females would be selected using the same phenotypic trait: either grease fleece weight or weaning weight. Estimated breeding values are based only on the individual animals' phenotypes (i.e., no pedigree or progeny information is used). The genetic correlation between grease fleece weight and weaning weight is 0.60, with breeding value standard deviations of 0.7 lb and 4 lb for grease fleece weight and weaning weights, respectively. Heritability is .40 for grease fleece weight and .20 for weaning weight. Rams are used as sires for one lamb crop, so male generation interval is 1.5 years; ewes are used as dams for 7 lamb crops, so female generation interval is 5 years. The best 1 out of 20 rams and the best 1 out of 5 ewes are selected as breeding animals.   a. Would genetic improvement for grease fleece weight be greater by directly selecting on grease fleece weight or indirectly by selecting on weaning weight? What would be the annual rate of genetic improvement (lb/yr) for grease fleece weight for each selection method?         b. By direct selection on grease fleece weight? ______________________               By indirect selection on weaning weight? ________________________

Which one of the following is true?
Stress can effect your performance on exam; it is called test anxiety. The cortisol levels in your blood go up when you stressed, sending you into a fight or flight response. This diverts oxygen from your brain (where you need it to think) to your limbs (where you need it to run or fight).  To decrease your stress levels so you can think more clearly for this exam...all you have to do is take five deep breaths. Inhale for a count of two, exhale for a count of five. Do this:  Inhale (counting to two). Exhale (counting to five). Inhale (counting to two). Exhale (counting to five). Inhale (counting to two). Exhale (counting to five). Inhale (counting to two). Exhale (counting to five). Inhale (counting to two). Exhale (counting to five).  Now you are calm and your mind is more ready for this exam. You can DO it! I am rooting for you! The answer to this question is true.

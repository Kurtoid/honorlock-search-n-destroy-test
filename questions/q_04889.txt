In the history of transnationalism, the Russo-Japanese war is of interest since it brought two nations representing different religions, civilizations, and races into head-on collision.  There was much comment at that time about these aspects of the war.  Of course, Japanese spokesmen worked hard to ensure that people in the west would not view the war in civilizational terms, as a clash of Eastern and Western civilizations.  Rather, the official propaganda emanating from Tokyo was that this was a conflict between civilization and barbarism.  But the "sub-text" was understood by people in Japan and elsewhere in Asia.  In Europe and the United States, too, some expressed alarm that an Asian nation with its own tradition appeared to be defeating a Christian nation, although Russia's Christianity had long estranged itself from both the Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations in the West.  Japan's victory was welcomed by Islamic countries such as Egypt and Turkey as an indication that Western civilization was not invincible, an impression that appeared to be confirmed when the allegedly civilized nations of Europe went to war against each other in 1914. --Iriye Akira, "The Russo-Japanese War in Transnational History," 2007 The events described in the passage above are best understood in the context of which of the following trends?

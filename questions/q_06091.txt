The signal molecule is secreted by specialized endocrine cells, carried over far distances with the circulatory system, and finally is perceived by target cells far away from the signal-producing cells. Such signaling molecules are called hormones, per definition signal molecules that act over great distances. Although we rarely think about them, the glands of the endocrine system and the hormones they release influence almost every cell, organ, and function of our bodies. The endocrine system is instrumental in regulating mood, growth and development, tissue function, and metabolism, as well as sexual function and reproductive processes. In endocrine signaling, _________. 1 The cell producing the messenger expresses receptors on its surface that can respond to that messenger 2) The messenger molecules travel only short distances through the extracellular space to cells that are in close proximity to the cell that is generating the message 3) The messenger molecules reach their target cells via passage through bloodstream 4) The messenger molecules are usually limited in their ability to travel around the body because they are inherently unstable or they are degraded by enzymes or they bind to extracellular matrix

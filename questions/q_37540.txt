The production of acetanilide(C8H9NO) involves the treatment of aniline(C6H7N) with acetic anhydride(C4H6O3).  This reaction produces an amide called acetanilide(C8H9NO) and the byproduct acetic acid (C2H4O2).  The reaction is as follows: aniline           +           acetic anhydride         --------->      acetanilide             +          acetic acid C6H7N                           C4H6O3                                         C8H9NO                              C2H4O2 molar mass C6H7N = 93.13 g/mol             molar mass C4H6O3 = 102.09 g/mol molar mass C8H9NO = 135.16 g/mol        molar mass C2H4O2 = 60.05 g/mol Since aniline is a liquid, conversion from milliliters to grams will yield the equivalence of 4.000 grams of aniline(C6H7N).  The mass of aniline(C6H7N) used in the reaction equals to 4.000 grams. The reaction goes 100% to completion and aniline(C6H7N) is the limiting reagent. If after performing this synthesis the actual mass of acetanilide(C8H9NO) is 4.420 grams, calculate the percent yield.  Select the best choice. (*hint: reaction balanced?)

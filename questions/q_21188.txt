Please read the description below of a new research study at TC, then answer the questions below. Parenting a preschool child is stressful. Parenting a child with a disability is often even more stressful. Parents of children with ASD are among the most stressed parents as compared to all other parents, including those who have children with other psychiatric conditions and developmental disabilities (Hayes &Watson, 2013).  Child characteristics (i.e., ASD symptom severity and behavior problems) directly influence parenting stress (Baker, Blacher, Crnic & Edelbrock, 2002; Hall & Graff, 2011; Hastings & Johnson, 2001; Kasari & Sigman, 1997; Lecavalier, Leone, & Wiltz, 2006).   The Incredible Years(r) (IY-BASIC) Basic Parent Program is an evidence-based parenting group curriculum with multiple studies demonstrating its effectiveness  in reducing parenting stress, depression, and coping skills and decreasing negative child behaviors (Gardner, & Leijten, 2017; Jones, Daley, Hutching, Bywater, & Eames, 2007).  Recently, a new Incredible Years(r) Parent Program for preschool children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and language delays (LD, ages 2-5) was developed and piloted (Dababnah & Parish, 2016; Hutchings, Pearson-Blunt, Pasteur, Healthy, & Williams, 2016; Webster-Stratton, Dababnah, & Olson, 2018).  There is a need to understand whether the IY-ASLD program works in a telehealth delivery format.  Thus, a research team has come together at TC to address this important topic.  The study aims to conduct the IY-ASD program in a telehealth format for a diverse sample of parents of children ages 2 to 5 who are currently enrolled in an ABA preschool in Yonkers.  Groups of 5 parents per group (total 50 parents) will meet as part of the group-based intervention that will continue for 12 weeks.  The study aims to understand if IY-ASD can a) improve parents' physical and psychological wellbeing, b) improve the quality of parents' interactions with their children, and c) improve children's behaviors with their parent and at school.  The research team will collect study measures prior to the start of the intervention (pre-test) and at the end of the 12-week intervention (post-test).    What is the definition of external validity for this study? What is the definition of internal validity for this study? Using this study as the context, explain the following three threats to internal validity. For each threat, provide its definition and apply it to this specific study example:  a)  Selection,  b)  Maturation,  c) History What is one recommended change to be made to the researcher's design that you would suggest to help the researcher to overcome the greatest number of the above-mentioned threats to internal validity? You have been hired by this research team to design and conduct a study that will explicitly address their research aims. Using the key components identified in Gersten et al. (2005), identify what you believe are three critical quality indicators of high quality research that need to be considered for the study design. For each one, describe the indicator within the context of this example and explain why you believe that indicator is so important.  Given your very limited budget, you cannot afford to measure too many things in this study. Note that the study team plans to measure intensity of intervention (# of sessions completed) and treatment fidelity of the delivery of the IY-ASLD (i.e., blind ratings of curricular material delivered per session).  Thus, aside from measures of the intervention, what are three other key independent variables the team should measure to be studied? For each one, describe how you will measure that variable (and why), and describe the unit of measurement for that variable.  Next, identify three key dependent variables for your study. For each one, describe how you will measure that variable (and why), and describe the unit of measurement for that variable. State three different testable research questions for your study that accurately address the aims of the study. Be sure to incorporate the above-mentioned independent and dependent variables in your research questions. Based on the work of Charman (2004), Jarrold and Brock (2004), and Seltzer et al. (2004), what might be three potential confounding factors in this study that may influence your findings (Note: identify at least one child-level confounding factor and one parent-level confounding factor).   Imagine that you have the potential to collect data on a comparison disability group for this study. a) Describe who will comprise your comparison group (which disability), b) explain why you chose that group, and c) on what characteristic would you consider matching your groups and why?  Imagine if a follow-up study was later conducted of these same parents and we learn that parent well-being moderates the association between the intensity of the intervention (# of telehealth lessons a parent completed) and their parenting behaviors with their children when they are in kindergarten.  Define the term "moderates" as it is used here. Imagine if  a follow-up study is later conducted of these same parents and we learn that parents' knowledge of ASD is a mediator of the association between the intensity of the intervention (# of telehealth lessons a parent completed) and their parenting behaviors with their children when they are in kindergarten.  Define the term "mediates" as it is used here.

Solve the system by elimination.  If the system is inconsistent or has dependent equations, say so. x+4y=132x+3y=6{"version":"1.1","math":"x+4y=132x+3y=6"}
At first, I assumed my setup would soon be common, and therefore somehow better--we'd all build our internal offices together. "There's no stopping it," a Reutters writer proclaimed a few months after I began my blogging gig. "The work force that fuels tomorrow's small businesses may largely be a stay-at-home crowd." Laptop prices were shrinking, and more employers were issuing them to their workers. Smartphones started to fill Americans' pockets. Skype was well established as an early leader in videochat, and co-workers silently traded jokes on GChat. The Great Recession would force a reckoning in how stuffy old companies operated, and offices would soon be obsolete.    Then it just didn't happen. In fact, something like the opposite happened: Co-working spaces sprang up for people without traditional offices, and the concept attracted hundreds of millions of investment dollars and, for a couple of years, my patronage. In 2018, I finally got a regular job. I sometimes ate lunch with my new colleagues. I bought a fancy water bottle for my desk. After a few months of commuting, I understood the allure of podcasts. "There are tons of studies on the positive benefits of teleworking, but most of that research is interviews and surveys with people who have self-selected into remote work," says Kati Peditto, an environmental-design psychologist at the U.S. Air Force Academy. Workers who value day-to-day flexibility in their schedules are ideal work-from-home candidates; those who like strict boundaries between their professional and personal lives, not so much. Career positioning also matters--people who have already built strong social and professional networks may not suffer much from the lack of face-to-face contact at the office, but for those still trying to make such ties, remote work can be alienating.

Consider the Even-Odd (EO) problem: Input: An undirected graph G =(V,E) and integer k. Output: If k is even then a subset S of vertices where |S|= k and S is an independent set, and if k is odd then a subset S of vertices where |S|=k and S is a clique, or NO if no such S exists. (Note, that if k is even then the output is an independent set or NO, and if k is odd then the output is a clique or NO.) Prove that the Even-Odd (EO) problem is NP-complete.

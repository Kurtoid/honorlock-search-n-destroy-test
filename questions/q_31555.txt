Since interest rates have declined significantly during that time and since the corporation is experiencing financial difficulty during the current year the bondholders agree to sell their bonds for a total of $610,000. By declaring Title 11 bankruptcy the corporation can obtain government assistance cash equal to $795,000. The corporation uses $610,000 to buy the bonds and reduces their liabilities by $1,000,000 when the bonds are retired. The other $185,000 of government assistance money is used to provide working capital for the business.

How much, if any, will Creative include in its federal gross income in the current year as a result of these transactions?

A public school decided to increase their classroom capacity. They have two options. The first one is to renovate the old building with an addition. The second one is to build a new building on an adjacent vacant lot. According to cost estimates, The first option needs an investment of $50M, and the second option needs $80M. Historical data of similar projects shows for option 1, there is 60% of strong demand that leads to $120M revenue and 40% of weak demand that only generates $60M revenue. for option 2 , there is 50% of strong demand that leads to $200M revenue and 50% of weak demand that only generates $50M revenue. Based on this context, calculate the expected earned value of both options with the decision tree technique. Based on the result, which option should the public school proceed with?

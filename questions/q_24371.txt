QUESTION 1             A bus travels along a straight road. The graphs shows how the velocity of the bus changes during a short journey.             Right click on the button to open the graph in a new window.                         1.1   State the velocity of the bus after 15 s.   (1)                   1.2   How long is the bus stationary during the 60 s.   (1)                   1.3   State the equation linking acceleration, change in velocity and time taken.   (1)                   1.4   Calculate the acceleration of the bus during the first 10 seconds. Give the unit.   (3)                   1.5   Calculate the distance the bus travelled in the first 30 seconds.   (2)                   1.6   State the equation linking average speed, distance moved and time taken.   (1)                   1.7   Calculate the average speed of the bus during the first 30 seconds.   (2)                   1.8   The bus travels further in the first 30 seconds than it does in the last 30 seconds. Explain how the graph shows this.   (2)                   1.9   Draw a free body force diagram to show all the forces acting on the bus during the time from 20 - 30 seconds.   (4)

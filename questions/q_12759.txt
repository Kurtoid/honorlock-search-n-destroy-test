In 2050, a space station on Mars consumes 100 toothpaste tubes per Martian year (which is 687 Earth days, or 669 Martian days) and keeps a safety stock of 70 tubes. Cargo ships with supplies are flown from Earth to Mars every half of the Martian year. Considering the period between launches as the only component of the order lead time, what is the reorder point for toothpaste tubes in whole units? Tips: 1. The reorder point formula works in many parts of our Galaxy, definitely on Mars. 2. The reorder point formula works with any time periods, including Earth days and Martian days (sols). However, I would go with the easiest: Martian years. Use of Excel is not required for this simple problem. You can do it in your head or use a built-in calculator within this exam.

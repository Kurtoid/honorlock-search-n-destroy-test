For this question, answer it on your work paper. In the box below, type "complete" when finished. Make sure to show all of your work.  Suppose a buffer is prepared by adding HOCL to NaOCL     Ka: = 3.0x10-4 a)  What mass of NaOCL  must be added to 725 mL of 0.120 M HOCL to give a buffer solution with a pH of 3.3?  Assume a negligible change in volume as the solid is added.   b) Explain how this buffer maintains a nearly constant pH when small amounts of strong acid or strong base are added.  Be specific and include relevant chemical equations (As in use this particular buffer when adding a strong base and when adding a strong acid) to support your answer.
SHORT ESSAY (450 Words or Less) In the space below describe the difference between a manager with a Theory X philosophy and one with  Theory Y philosophy. Explain how those differences can result into differing leadership styles and leadership behaviors. Based on your understanding of Theory X/Theory Y and which style do you believe is more effective. Clearly state your reasoning.  Grading HINT 1: In answering this question you must relate the basics of Theory X and Theory Y theory to the leadership types and study results taken from the behavioral leadership studies at The University of Iowa, Ohio State, the University of Michigan; and to the later work of Fred Fiedler, Hersey and Blanchard, and Robert House. It important that you be specific in any terminology you use as you answer this question. Grading HINT 2: In terms of earning a high grade your opinion is not as important as your reasoning; so you should be specific and the answer should be grounded in learnings from the text and class discussion. Your grade will be based almost entirely on a demonstrated understanding of Theory X and Theory Y and the relevant Leadership theories.

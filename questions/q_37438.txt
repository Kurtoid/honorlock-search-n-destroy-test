To combat red-light running crashes many states have installed red-light cameras at dangerous intersections to photograph the license plates of vehicles that run the red light. How effective are photo-red enforcement programs in reducing red-light-running crash incidents at intersections? A state's department of transportation conducted a comprehensive study of its photo-red enforcement program.

After analyzing the data(measured as the number of crashes caused by red-light-running per intersection per year) for 13 intersections in a specific county, the corresponding P-value is 0.005.

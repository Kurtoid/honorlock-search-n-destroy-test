You want to determine whether or not two different hotel chains charge different rates for the same night.  You randomly select 4 days each month, and look up the rates at a Marriott Courtyard and a Hilton Garden Inn, and determine their room rates for each of those nights.
In this question you will be designing a solution using the fantastic four method called selectKth that takes the first node in a singly linked list and returns the element at position k (starting at zero).  [You are going to implement that recursive method in the next question.] For example, if selectKth(2) is called on a list with nodes containing: 10, 5, 40, 32, it would return 40. Assume that the list will always be long enough to find the element. A sample implementation for a node of a singly linked list is given below - your method must be in terms of it. public class IntNode { private IntNode next; private final int x; public IntNode(int x) { next = null; this.x = x; } public IntNode getNext() { return next; } public void setNext(IntNode node) { next = node; } public T getX() { return x; } }  Using the fantastic four approach, determine the size n problem for the method selectKth. [2 points] Identify the stopping condition(s) and the return value, if any, for the problem. [2 points] Determine the size m problem(i.e. the "subproblem") for the problem. [2 points] How is the size-n problem constructed from the size m problem? [2 points]

For your final examination, you should write a cohesive, well-developed essay that fully addresses the essay prompt. Please closely read the following CQ Researcher articles (published March 25, 2011 (volume 21, issue 12)) and then the prompt below.     "Women and Sports-Has Title IX Led to Unfair Treatment of Men's Sports: Pro"by Karen Owoc, Advisory Board Member for the College Sports Council   "Women and Sports-Has Title IX Led to Unfair Treatment of Men's Sports: Con"by Linda Carpenter, Professor of Physical Education at Brooklyn College     par. 1Title IX is a good law. The way it's regulated, however, is not only unfair but unconstitutional. The law precisely states that "no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance." par. 2But men don't enjoy equal protection under the law. Enacted as an anti-discrimination statute, Title IX has been converted to a rigid quota system that has denied men sports opportunities. par. 3To enforce the law, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) devised regulations that include a three-part test to assess Title IX compliance as it pertains to athletics. When it comes to litigation, though, part one is the only one that stands up in court. par. 4Part one requires that opportunities for male and female athletes be "substantially proportionate." After the precedent-setting 1995 gender-discrimination case of Cohen v. Brown University, proportionality became the safe harbor for compliance. Proportionality essentially means that if a school is, for example, 56 percent female, then 56 percent of its athletes must be female (allowing for a 5 percent variance). par. 5Using a rigid quota system dictated by raw enrollment numbers has changed the way college athletics is run. It ignores individual athletic interests and assumes they're exactly equal between men and women everywhere--younger and older, on all campuses. Not all women want to participate in athletics, nor do all men. par. 6When schools have too few female athletes (i.e., the percentage of females enrolled exceed the percentage of athletes), they're presumed noncompliant. They're then forced to create the illusion of substantial proportionality by denying men the opportunity to participate. This means that many women's teams have not been helped, but rather, men have been hurt. Applying a rigid quota system to athletics without regard to individual student interests and abilities is illogical and discriminatory   par. 1Title IX has not led to unfair treatment of men's sports. The numbers of male student athletes and teams are the highest in at least 22 years. par. 2In 2009 and 2010, males comprised about 43 percent of college enrollment but 57 percent of NCAA varsity student athletes. While women have made significant gains in athletic participation under Title IX, more athletes of both genders participate in sports than ever before. par. 3Team counts are another sign that Title IX hasn't treated men unfairly. In the last 22 years, 398 new men's teams were added to already well-developed, historically privileged and institutionally nurtured men's programs, such as football and basketball. Of course, the number of individual student athletes, not the number of teams on which those students play, is most significant when examining fair treatment. But team counts are important. par. 4Title IX turns 40 on June 23, 2012, yet blaming and partisanship persist. Neither is productive in the effort to increase opportunities for males or females. Blame-placing and partisanship are fellow travelers with administrators who manipulate team rosters to make gender-equity numbers look better or cut men's or women's "minor" sports while increasing budgets for prominent ones based on the erroneous notion that prominent teams make a profit rather than simply launder money. par. 5Profit-making is neither a realistic nor an appropriate goal for athletics programs. And cutting athletic opportunities for either males or females is a counterproductive idea. Administrators who manipulate rosters or cut lower-profile sports do so because their institutions have allowed inequity to persist or placed privilege ahead of compliance with federal law. par. 6The issue is not who deserves sports more, but what can be done, even with budgetary constraints, to provide those valuable opportunities and experiences to students fairly.       _____________________________________________________________________________________ Topic: Using the above-noted articles, "Women and Sports-Has Title IX Led to Unfair Treatment of Men's Sports: Pro" and "Women and Sports-Has Title IX Led to Unfair Treatment of Men's Sports: Con," as reference sources, write an essay in which you analyze each author's use of one rhetorical tool or rhetorical appeal to achieve his or her specific purpose.  To start, determine what you believe is each author's specific purpose. Choose one of the following specific purposes for each author: to accuse, to calm, to condemn, to celebrate, to correct, to counter, to defend, to dismiss, to incite, to justify, to overturn, to praise, to provoke, to rally, to silence, or to solve.   Then, determine which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Pro" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose and then which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Con" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose. You must choose both rhetorical tools and/or appeals from the following list:       allusions authorities/outside sources definitions description dialogue examples facts figurative language narration personal testimony/anecdotes scenarios statistics counterarguments concessions qualifiers organization voice appeal to logic appeal to emotion appeal to character appeal to need appeal to value       Organize your ideas into a four-paragraph essay that includes the following paragraphs: (paragraph 1) an introduction paragraph; (paragraphs 2 and 3) two separate, well-developed rhetorical tools and/or rhetorical appeals body paragraphs (one focused on the "Pro" author's use of your chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose and the other focused on the "Con" author's use of your other chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose); and (paragraph 4) a conclusion paragraph. Your essay must include a forecasting thesis statement and effective topic and concluding sentences in each body paragraph. At least four times in your essay, you also must correctly integrate quotations, paraphrases, and/or summaries from the above-noted articles; remember to include proper in-text citations.

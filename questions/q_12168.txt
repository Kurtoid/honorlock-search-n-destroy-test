You are interested in further understanding the signal transduction pathway that controls the production of Pig1, a protein important for regulating cell size. Activation of the TRK receptor leads to activation of the GTP-binding protein, Ras, which then activates a protein kinase that phosphorylates the SZE transcription factor. SZE only interacts with the nuclear transport receptor when it is phosphorylated. SZE is a gene activator for the Pig1 This pathway is diagrammed in the Figure below.  Normal cells grown under standard conditions (without ligand) are 14 mm in diameter while normal cells exposed to TRK ligand are 10.5 mm in diameter. Given this situation, which of the following conditions do you predict will more likely lead to smaller cells?

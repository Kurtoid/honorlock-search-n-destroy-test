Three forces are applied to an equilateral triangle with a distance from the center to any vertex of 0.350-m. The force at one vertex, 11.9 N, is along the line from the center to the vertex. The next force, 8.50, at the second vertex is at right angles in the counterclockwise direction to the line connecting the center to that vertex. The force, 14.6 N, at the third vertex makes a clockwise angle of 40.0o with line connecting the center to that vertex. What is the net torque on the wheel due to these three forces for an axis perpendicular to the equilateral triangle and passing through its center?

Nina and John are your classmates who are on a field work to measure the distance between Westeros and Winterfell. They however, discovered that on June 21st (summer solstice), the Sun only cast a vertical shadow on Westeros and was directly overhead on Winterfell. On same day at 12 noon, they dug a stick on the ground at Westeros and measured the angle of the shadow to be 21.20. Given that Eratosthenes, a renown Westeros scientist, has measured the diameter of this planet to be 40,000km, what is the distance between Westeros and Winterfell as would be calculated by Nina and John?  Note: use 3600 as the sphere of this hypothetical planet.

Genetic giants Researchers studied the genetics of height in a sample of 183,727 people. They discovered 180 genes that contributed to variation in adult height among individuals. Many of these genes were represented in the population by more than two alleles. Most of the genes code for proteins that promote the growth of bones. Still, only 10% of phenotypic variation in height is explained by genes. The remaining 90% might be explained by undiscovered genes or environmental factors, such as nutrition. Assuming that other factors were relatively similar in the sample size above, answer the questions below.   Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 16-20.   16. If a tall person mated with a short person, their offspring would likely be intermediate in height.

In the following hash table, what index will the key-value pair 21-G be stored at? Assume open addressing is being used with linear probing, that the hash function being used is: hash(key) = key mod 12, and that empty spots are marked (e).
Problem 1. For the flow net shown in the figure below, if the datum is selected at the downstream water surface, determine (a) the total head at point b (10 points); (b) the pressure head at point b if point b is 8 m below the downstream ground surface (or 10 m below the downstream water surface) (5 points); (c) uplift pressure at point b (5 points); (d) the factor of safety against heave on the downstream side of the single-row sheet pile structure shown below(20 points). The depth of penetration of sheet pile (D) is 4.5 m.  (total 40 points)      Problem 2. The following figure is a layer of sand (

What is expected undiscounted cash flow in the final year of an investment assuming the following? 1) $10,000 after-tax cash inflow from operations, 2) $1,000 before tax to be received from the sale of a fully depreciated machine, and 3) a $2,000 decrease in net working capital? Use a tax rate of 21%.
As Christopher delivered his speech, he noticed that some members of his audience looked confused as he explained one of his main points. As a result, he slowed down and explained the point again. In this case, Christopher was ________________________________.
Figure 4 shows a circuit with seven scannable flip-flops (within the same clock domain), some are positive-edge triggered while some are negative-edge triggered.                 Submit everything on-line.             (a) Connect them into a single scan chain. You do not need to really design the details. Just give the scan ordering, e.g., A -> E -> F..... (b) Assume 700 test patterns are required to fully test the above circuit. How many test clock cycles are required? (c) If flip-flops (FFs) C and E have capture time violation during testing because of excessive clock skew. What should be done to fix this      problem ? (d) Assume circuit delays for CKT1 and CKT2 in Figure 4 are the same (e.g., 4 ns), and we compare the sensitivity to capture time violation      between FFs (C, E) and FFs (D, F). Which one is more sensitive? Give the reason. (e) If a lock-up latch is inserted between FFs C and E to fix the clock skew problem during scan mode, how many test clock cycles are      required due to the addition of this extra lock-up latch? Again, 700 test patterns will be applied.
Rosaslind Franklin showed that the amount of A was always equal to Thymine, and the amount of Cytosine was equal to Guanine.
Using Prospect Theory:  Explain how people judge gains versus losses Explain how people judge small differences in values of large magnitude versus small magnitude (e.g., losing $5 when you have $5000 versus losing $5 when you have $10)

The police chief of a large city discovered that a notorious arsonist was currently living there. Although the arsonist was famous for her crimes, she had always been acquitted when brought to trial. The police chief was retiring soon and wanted to be the one who finally brought the arsonist to justice. To try to catch her in the act of arson, the police chief went undercover and approached the arsonist with an offer. The chief told the arsonist that he knew who she was and that he had been offered a large sum of money to burn down a business and make it look like an accident. He told the arsonist that he needed her expertise and that he would give her half the money if she agreed to help him. The arsonist initially told the chief that she was retired from her life of crime; however, after the chief offered her more money, she finally agreed to help him. As the time for the arson drew near, the arsonist had second thoughts. The morning before the arson was scheduled to take place, the arsonist went to a police station and told the officers of the plan. She told them that her colleague (the undercover police chief) would be at the business at a particular time with fire-starting materials. Is the arsonist guilty of conspiracy at common law?

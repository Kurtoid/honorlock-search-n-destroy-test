A production manager wants to test the hypothesis that production output is the same for various shifts at the plant.  She collects the following data.    Day Night Graveyard   100 101 93   110 105 108   115 105 109   117 108 110   97 111 109   108 103 112    With those data conduct a test where the null hypothesis is that average production for the day shift is the same as average production for the graveyard shift and find the relevant values.  Do not assume the variances are equal. (a) The estimated difference in the means is [a]. (b) The test statistic is [b]. (c) The p-value is [c].

Refer to the following scenario to answer the next three (3) questions. For her honors thesis, Kate is studying whether students learn more from professors who use humor during lecture. She has 80 participants come into the lab, where they watch a professor give a 15-minute pre-recorded lecture. There are two versions of the lecture: In one version, the professor tells jokes and funny stories. The other version has identical lecture material, but no jokes or funny stories. Participants are randomly assigned to one or the other version. After viewing the lecture, they take a multiple-choice test over the content.

Hayes, T.B., Khoury, V., Narayan, A., Nazir, M., Park, A., Brown, T., dame, L., Chan, E., Buchholz, D., Stueve, T., & Gallipeau, S.  (2010).  Atrazine induces complete feminization and chemical castration in male African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), Proceedings from the National Academy of Science, online early version, 1-6.      doi/10.1073/pnas.0909519107 The herbicide atrazine is one of the most commonly applied pesticides in the world. As a result, atrazine is the most commonly detected pesticide contaminant of ground, surface, and drinking water. Atrazine is also a potent endocrine disruptor that is active at low, ecologically relevant concentrations. Previous studies showed that atrazine adversely affects amphibian larval development. The present study demonstrates the reproductive consequences of atrazine exposure in adult amphibians. Atrazine-exposed males were both demasculinized (chemically castrated) and completely feminized as adults. Ten percent of the exposed genetic males developed into functional females that copulated with unexposed males and produced viable eggs. Atrazine- exposed males suffered from depressed testosterone, decreased breeding gland size, demasculinized/feminized laryngeal development, suppressed mating behavior, reduced spermatogenesis, and decreased fertility. These data are consistent with effects of atrazine observed in other vertebrate classes. The present findings exemplify the role that atrazine and other endocrine-disrupting pesticides likely play in global amphibian declines. In this study, what was the independent variable (IV)?

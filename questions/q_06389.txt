GatorFox Browser - Part 2 Think about how you might implement the navigation system of the GatorFox browser using the data structures that you stated above. Then, write the pseudocode or C++ code for handling the commands in this forwards/backwards system in the GatorFoxNavigation Class below. There are three commands that must be handled: BACK, FORWARD, and NEW_PAGE. You can assume all commands given will be valid; that is, you won't be given a forwards/backwards that can't fulfill its action. Use the data structure you believe is optimal to solve this problem (You will lose points if you do not choose a data structure that ensures optimal time and space complexity). (6 points)   Boilerplate:  class Page {  String pageName;}// A class that gives a Page and the action type to the GatorFoxNavigation navigate function.class Action { enum ActionTypes {  BACK,  FORWARD,  NEW_PAGE }; ActionTypes type; //Allows you to identify what action should be performed Page newPage; // Will be null unless action is a NEW_PAGE action}//YOU CAN COPY THIS CLASS INTO THE FREE RESPONSE SECTION AND WRITE YOUR SOLUTIONclass GatorFoxNavigation {  //TODO 1: Name and declare any data structures you want to use here. // Handles navigation to previously visited pages (back/forward) // and returns the page to which the user is navigating. Page navigate(Action action) {   //TODO 2: Write the pseudocode and don't forget to return the page to which the user is navigating) }}

Label as Q-XY on your paper. (7 min.) You must show all your work for this problem on your paper.  You must show starting variables, starting equations, and use one step equation dimensional analysis where applicable.  In addition to showing you work on paper, you must state you final answer(s) here with units.  Failure to do so will result in zero credit regardless of your work on paper. Consider the reaction below:  2 XY (g)  -  2 X (g)  +  Y2 (g) For this second order reaction, the rate constant is 0.9880 M-1s-1 at 70. degrees C.  A) Starting with a concentration of 0.7741 M, calculate the concentration of XY after 600.0 s. B) Calculate the half life when the concentration of XY at time zero is 1.0510 M. Type final answers with appropriate letter.

Instructions: Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.        (1) Street skateboarding and vert skateboarding differ in several ways. (2) Street skateboarding takes place in outdoor public areas where there are staircases, benches, walls, and sidewalks. (3) In contrast, vert skateboarding usually takes place in skate parks with ramps or bowls. (4) Another major difference is the tricks performed in each type of skateboarding. (5) Street skaters use a style called the grind, which involves scraping their boards' axles against objects such as stairway handrails. (6) They also perform tricks that involve kicking the board to flip it into the air. (7) Vert skaters, on the other hand, use the steep walls of the ramps or bowls to pick up speed and gain "air time" at the edges. (8) While airborne, they perform different flips and spins. (9) To achieve these tricks, they use boards that are wider and flatter than street boards, which have upturned noses and tails to aid kicking.   Select the number of the topic sentence in the paragraph above.

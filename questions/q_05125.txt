As a triage nurse in the ER, you begin the assessment of an elderly patient complaining of bloody diarrhea and severe stomach cramps. You find the patient has a fever of 104degF as well, and is showing signs of dehydration. IV fluids are administered while further analysis of the patient continues. Specimen collection from the patient is ordered for microbial analysis in the hospital laboratory.  Microscopic analysis revealed the presence of gram-negative bacilli in the sample that was collected. Based upon this information, you picture in your mind which of the following images?

The uniform rod (length [L] m) in the figure rotates in the plane of the figure about an axis through one end, with a rotational inertia of [I] kg*m2   around this pivot point. As the rod swings through its lowest position, it collides with a [mp] kg putty wad that sticks to the end of the rod. If the rod's angular speed just before the collision is [w0] rad/s, what is the ratio of the final angular speed to the initial angular speed?
When difficult people are ignored, they tend to stop their bad behavior.
QUESTION 7 The diagram below shows a mass piece fastened with ropes to the top of two poles (PQ and RS), such that the mass piece is in equilibrium. The force in the rope from point P (T1) and R (T2) to the mass piece is 8 N and 5 N respectively. The angle between T1 and the vertical is 35o and the angle between T2 and RS is 55o. Right click on the blue button, to open the diagrams in a new tab.       7.1   Define the term resultant force.    (2)     7.2   Represent all the forces (angles included) that act on the mass piece by means of a vector diagram.    (4)     7.3   Determine the mass of the mass piece.   (4)             [10]

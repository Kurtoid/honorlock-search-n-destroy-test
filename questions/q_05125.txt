Although there were errors in speech typical of a child with limited high-frequency audibility, her speech was developing well and was intelligible to unfamiliar listeners. She demonstrated receptive language abilities in the low average range for her age. Amy was imaginative in art and symbolic play. She had an engaging sense of humor and highly supportive home and school environments. The primary concern identified during the evaluation was Amy's difficulties in self-expression. Extensive language sample analysis revealed expressive language formulation difficulties that were affecting her social skills in the inclusive environment. Amy's personal narratives were disorganized and reduced in complexity. For example, she attempted to explain to the examiner why she did not like witches in the following narrative: "I don't like witches. That . . . I have . . . my grandma have that one [pointing to a picture of a witch]. It clap [demonstrates with her hands]. And I have one. It's down in the . . . in my freezer [she means it is stored beside the freezer]. Her clap [gestures]. I don't like him. He say heeheehee." Grammatical errors could be related in part to audibility. Formulation difficulties were observed in her tendency to produce false starts, her reliance on nonspecific references, semantic errors, and reliance on gestures to help carry the message. These expressive language challenges were affecting her participation in class and her socialization with peers. When she was unsure how to express her idea, she would "shut down," as the school had observed. Her mother described several examples at school when Amy cried in order to solve a verbal problem instead of expressing herself. For example, another student inadvertently picked up Amy's materials and got in line. Amy responded by saying, "Hey" and grabbing at the books. When the books were not returned to her, she began to cry.   So - as a member of Amy's IEP team, what do you suggest for her goals and for her classroom placement in the Least Restrictive Environment? What else do you think can/should be done to support Amy? Include any possible referrals for home/school.

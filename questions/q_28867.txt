Do you go to the doctor or do you just try to manage the illness on your own? Do you eat different foods when you are sick? Does someone take care of you?  How does being sick affect your hygiene habits?   Useful vocabulary (you don't HAVE to use these):  normalmente - normally usualmente - usually cuando - when (if not being used as a question) la sopa - soup el agua - water comodo(a) - comfortable si - if (notice there is no accent like there is for the word "yes")  Reminder: You are NOT ALLOWED to use online translators of any type.

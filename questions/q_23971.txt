Find the mean, median, mode, standard deviation (SD), and standard error of measurement (SEM) for the 10 scores. 2. Calculate the reliability of the scores by dividing the scores into two groups (column 1 and column 2). 3. Correct the r obtained in (2) by using the Spearman Brown formula that doubles the length of the test when applied in split half reliability. 4. Change a T score of 32 (m = 50, SD = 10) into a standard score with a mean of 100 and SD of 15. 5. Change a standard score of 74 (m = 100, SD =15) into a Z-score (m = 0, SD = 1). What is the qualitative label for this score? 6. Create a confidence interval at the 68% level for a FSIQ of 121 with an SEM of 3.0.

As a biomedical engineer you are part of a study investigating the growth of plants in air containing high amounts of CO2. For this purpose you need to prepare a container with air at a given CO2 content.  You use the following procedure:   You add exactly 12.3 g of dry ice (frozen, solid CO2, density: 1.7 g/cm3) into an open steel container with a volume of 2.0 gallons; the container contains (CO2-free) air. The initial temperature within the container is 25.0 C. The atmospheric pressure in the laboratory is 1.00 atm.   The steel container is immediately sealed and the solid CO2 is vaporized to CO2    (CO2free) air is pumped into the container. The capacity of the pump at 25C is 500 ml/min.   The temperature in the container is equilibrated to 25 C and the pressure in the container is measured.  The final CO2 content in the container should be 10.%.     Questions:  Provide an outline of your solution strategy for b. and c. What is the final gauge pressure in the container in psi ?  How long does the pump have to run.

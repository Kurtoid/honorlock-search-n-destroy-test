A bank wants to use simulation to study its waiting line system. In this problem, you will simulate 7 customers going through the waiting line Assume that the interarrival times and service time probability distributions are given below:       Inter-arrival time (min)   Probability     1   .25     2   .35     3   .3     4   .1         Service time (min)   Probability     1   .35     2   .3     3   .25     4   .1         a. Use the following six random numbers to determine the interarrival time of each of customers 2-7. Inter-arrival time doesn't apply to the first customer.  We will assume that the first customer shows up at the very beginning of the day, time 0. : (4 points) .32, .72, .64, .42, .17, .81   b. Use the following seven random numbers to determine the service time of each of the first seven customers : (4 points) .81, .10, .46, .95, .78, .27, .35   c. Assume there is one teller. Simulate the waiting line system for these first seven customers to determine the waiting time for each customer and the idle time for the server. Create a table with appropriate headers by clicking the table icon in the editing options above.  (15 points)

We are considering entering a derivatives transaction with a new counterparty. We believe that this company could potentially default at three times during the 3-year life of the proposed deal. The estimated probabilities of default are 1.9% at the end of year one, 2.2% at the end of year two, and 2.7% at the end of year three. We expect the value of the deal to be -$2.3 million (minus 2.3 million) at the end of year one, $1.9 million (positive 1.9 million) at the end of year two, and $3.8 million (positive 3.8 million) at the end of year three. We estimate the recovery rate to be 38%. If interest rates are assumed to be 3% compounded continuously, what is your estimate of this transaction's credit value adjustment (CVA)?

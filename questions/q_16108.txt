The Smith family comes to you for therapy: Grandma (53), Mom (32) and Son (10). The family is lower-middle class. Mom and Grandma are Caucasian, Son is biracial. Son has been depressed for the last several months - he sleeps a lot, doesn't want to leave the house, and is argumentative and irritable. Mom works two jobs, so Grandma is often in charge of getting Son to school, which has become increasingly more difficult.  Grandma is worried about Son and thinks he needs extra support and care.  When Son isn't in school, the principal calls Mom, who then has to leave work to make Son go to school. Mom is worried she will lose her job because of these issues. Mom and Grandma disagree about what to do about Son's behavior. Please number your answers and ensure that you have answered the question in your response. And please start your essay by including your student ID# (e.g., MFT 12345678).  Define the concept of circular causality. To do this, use the terms A and B and describe how they are interrelated from this perspective.  Using the concept of circular causality, provide a relational hypothesis about how this problem is being maintained. Be specific. In your explanation, describe why a systems approach is beneficial with this case.  Why would it be beneficial to complete a genogram with this family? Give details related to this specific family. In addition to completing a genogram with the family, give one example of a systemic intervention you could do with this family, as well as an explanation of how it could be helpful given the details of this case. Based on the information given in the case above, identify how one sociocultural factor (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity, religion, culture, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, physical/cognitive ability, age, etc.) is related to the family's functioning and the presenting problem.

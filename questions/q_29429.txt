Buyer and Seller enter into a written contract for the sale of 100,000 tons of "Grade A Coromandel ground nuts." The contract provides that "failure to supply Grade A nuts will be a breach of this agreement." Moreover, the contract provides that not more than 1 percent of the nuts can be contaminated with foreign substances. It states that if the contamination is greater than 1 percent, Buyer retains the unilateral right to reject the entire shipment. Seller delivers the 100,000 tons, but approximately 2 percent of the nuts are contaminated. Buyer refuses to take the nuts. Seller sues. It wants to introduce evidence that in the ground-nut trade, it is standard business practice among merchants to allow up to 5 percent contaminated nuts, and to simply reduce the price to reflect the higher level of contamination. Can Seller introduce this evidence at trial?

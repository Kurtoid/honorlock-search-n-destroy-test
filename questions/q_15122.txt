Sputnik I was launched into orbit around Earth in 1957. It had a perigee (the distance from the point of closest approach to the center of Earth) of 6.61 x 106 m and an apogee (the distance from the furthest point in the orbit to the center of Earth) of 7.33 x 106 m. Its mass was 83.5 kg. What was the difference in kinetic energy as it moved from perigee to apogee? The mass of Earth is 5.97 x 1024 kg and

You have just been contacted by John Stephenson of Brough Farms Limited ('the Company'). He wanted to advise you as regards the following:- a) The directors of the Company want to make a few amendments to their Articles, in particular with regard to the conduct of Board and General meetings. He will let you have further details in due course. The Company currently has unamended Model Articles; b) The directors of the Company wish to change the Company's name to Brough (Westmorland) Farms Limited; and c) The directors of the Company wish to change the Company's registered office from the address of its accountants to the main farm business premises at Ash Trees Farm, Church Brough, Cumbria CA16 4EJ. John Stephenson is firmly of the view that these changes are not contentious, they have already, he says, been agreed in principle by his fellow directors and by the shareholders of the Company but in the first instance he has asked you to write a letter to him setting out the legal procedures which would need to be followed in terms of company meetings and company resolutions for approving and making the necessary changes and also in terms of any registration requirements. He has said that he wants full notice procedures to be followed for any required meetings.

Researchers would like to better understand the risk factors associated with myocardial infarction (heart attack) and predict the age (dependent variable) patients are likely to develop cardiovascular disease based on a set of risk factors. They have collected data on patients who have experienced a heart attack and wish to know which independent variables (body mass index, cholesterol, cortisol, alcohol, caffeine, and blood sugar) are the best predictors. Perform a multiple linear regression analysis for the cardio data. Start your analysis by creating a correlation matrix for all of the variables. Which three independent variables are most highly correlated with the dependent variable? List the variables from most highly correlated (1) to least correlated (3).  Variable 1: [var1]                                     Variable 2: [var2]                                                            Variable 3: [var3]

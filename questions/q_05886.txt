In class, we emphasized how individual animal gain and gain per unit land area respond to stocking rate. We drew graphs to show these two responses. In words, please describe the shapes of these two curves starting at a very low stocking rate and ending with a high stocking rate. You do not need to use numbers for gain or for stocking rate, you can use words like high, low, and moderate. As part of your description, be sure to indicate at what type of stocking rate we would expect to observe the maximum value of gain per animal and of gain per unit land area. Lastly, based on how stocking rate affects the characteristics of the forage the animal is grazing, indicate why the curves are shaped the way you have described them. (10)

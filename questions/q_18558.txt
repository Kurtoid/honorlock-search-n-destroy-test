This provision prevents ex-employees from either becoming a competitor or working for a competitor for a designated period of time.
In a rush to get a qualified retirement plan installed before the deadline for the year, the owner of Baxter Concrete failed to get a determination letter from the IRS. Five years later, Baxter is audited. If the IRS finds a disqualifying provision or if an essential provision is missing from Baxter's plan,

Figure 2-1 shows a binary counter with parallel load. When Load = 1 and Count = 0, we have A3A2A1A0 = I3I2I1I0. When Count = 1 and Load = 0, A3A2A1A0 counts from 0000... to 1111, 0000. . and then repeats. When both Count and Load = 1, the circuit implements Load. When Count and Load = 0, the circuit will NOT change state. C_out (representing the case of A3A2A1A0 =1111) is used to trigger the next stage to count.   Assume 3 blocks of this circuit are cascaded as a 12-bit binary counter with parallel load as shown in Figure 2-2. To simplify the circuits in Figure 2-2, only global signals Load, Count, C_out's, and Clocks are shown. This is a perfect example to implement gated clock design for reducing the power consumption. Give the switching expressions to activate the clock signals CLK0, CLK1, and CLK2. Note that you just need to write the gated clock activation functions for these 3 clock signals, CLK0, CLK1, CLK2.

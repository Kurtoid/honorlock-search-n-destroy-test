The analytics major has some very important objectives embedded in it. One of the most important is for you to learn the technical aspects of building predictive models. In addition to that, this class had several objectives, and one of those was to prepare you to go out into the world with the ability to communicate the quantitative results of those models.  We looked at a number of myths regarding the communication side of that process.  Most analytics professionals are gifted with the ability to make sense out of numbers and patterns in the numbers.  As a result, we might have more of an introverted personality.  We talked about a number of myths associated with public speaking.  Which of these myths do you associate with the most and what do you plan to do to overcome it?

This exam uses a data set "midterm", which has 100 observations of two iris species (setosa and virginica), recorded as variable "species". There are three numeric input variables, x1, x2, and x3, and a numerical output variable y. An indicator of specie virginica is created for your convenience, called "speciesvirginica" (0=setosa, 1=virginica). In addition, a column "test" is created, so that TRUE-valued observations are considered a test sample, other observations a training sample. Read the data by             midterm=read.csv("midterm.csv")           train=midterm[!midterm$test,]           test=midterm[midterm$test,] First, consider predicting y by input variables x1, x2, and x3. To evaluate any predictive model, which is expected to estimate the true prediction error?

Did you ever wonder how trainers get porpoises to do all those tricks, like leaping over a high bar or jumping through a hoop?  Wild porpoises are first taught to eat fish from their trainer's hand.  When the animal accepts a fish, the trainer blows a whistle.  The porpoise associates the whistle with "correct" behavior.  Once the porpoise touches a human hand to get a fish, it will touch other things, like a red target ball.  For example, the trainer will hold the ball high above the water while leaning over a kind of pulpit.  Seeing the ball, the porpoise leaps out of the water; it knows it will be rewarded with a fish.  A hoop can then be substituted for a ball, and the porpoise's behavior can be "shaped" so it will jump through the hoop.  If the porpoise misses by jumping too low, the fish reward is withheld.  The intelligent animal will associate "no fish" with "wrong" behavior; very quickly, the purpoise will be leaping gracefully through the center of the hoop. _________24.

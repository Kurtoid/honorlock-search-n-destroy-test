Summit Inc. is a Country X corporation that commenced operations in 20Y1. Summit reported a pre-tax book loss of $200,000 in 20Y1. There were no book-tax differences, so the taxable loss was also $200,000 in 20Y1. Country X allows NOLs to be carried forward, but for only five years. There is no taxable income limitation in the carryforward year. On December 31, 20Y1, Summit's management determined that it was more likely than not that Summit would realize no future tax benefits from the $200,000 NOL carryforward. However, Summit did become profitable in 20Y6 and deducted $150,000 of the NOL carryforward against its income in 20Y6. The remaining $50,000 of the NOL carryforward expired in 20Y6. Prepare the journal entries that Summit would make in 20Y1 and 20Y6 to recognize the effects of the NOL carryforward on its deferred tax expense. Do not prepare the entries for effects of the NOL on Summit's current tax expense. The Country X tax rate is 30%.

Re: A study seeks to understand the impact of a stigmatized label (i.e. ADHD) on children's social behavior.  For this study, the following laboratory research situation was set up:  Researchers recruited a total of 40 fifth grade students who were told to complete a task together with another peer. All of the participants were told that the focus of observation was to examine their task performance. One half of the participants were randomly assigned to Condition A which involved students being told that a "peer" (Alex) has been diagnosed with ADHD in the past year (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder--a stigmatizing condition). The other half of participants in Condition B were told that Alex has had an appendix surgery in the past year (a non-stigmatizing condition). Alex, a 5th grader who was actually part of the research team, was instructed to behave in the same way with each participant (Alex was unaware of the purpose of the research). Based on Labeling Theory, the study hypothesis was that children who think that their play partner has ADHD would be less friendly and less cooperative toward their play-partner relative to peers told that the play partner had appendix surgery. Three research assistants were trained on a coding system (codes with definitions) to assess the children's level of friendliness and cooperativeness. Then, they were asked to independently observe the behavior of child participants behind a one-way mirror and code in the following way: Friendliness: (1) friendly (2) somewhat friendly and (3) unfriendly Cooperativeness: (1) cooperative (2) somewhat cooperative and (3) uncooperative -------------------------------------------------------------- Does this research involve testing a theory?
[Short Answer #5]  How did the Supreme Court's primary argument shift in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943) as a way to challenge a similar mandatory flag law that was declared constitutional just three years earlier in Minersville School District v. Gobitis (1940)?

Janet spent her day going to the grocery store, working in her garden, and watching a movie about pirates. When sleeping at night, she dreams that she is a pirate in a sword fight with a giant rose , but she knows she can win the fight if she buys all the toilet paper in the store. The next day she recalls her dream, and thinks that the randomness of her dream probably had something to do with her brain processing the activites of her day. Janet's reaction to her dream is best represented by the following dream theory:

After a spacecraft is built, it needs to be fueled in order to actually be launched. One popular component of rocket fuels is hydrazine, N2H4, which can be synthesized from ammonia and sodium hypochlorite, shown below. A fuel production company needs to know the enthalpy of this reaction, and assigns you the job of experimentally measuring DHrxn.  2 NH3 (aq) + NaClO (aq) - N2H4 (aq) + NaCl (aq) + H2O (l) You combine 130.0 mL of 0.8[NH3] M ammonia and 110.0 mL of 0.6[NaClO] M sodium hypochlorite, both initially at 2[Ti] degC, in a perfectly-insulating constant pressure (coffee-cup) calorimeter. The temperature of this reaction peaks at a final temperature of 3[Tf] degC. What is the enthalpy of reaction, per mole of ammonia consumed? (The density of water is 0.998 g/mL.) (Additional 12 points) On your Handwritten Pages, show all of your work and box your final answer. ( Q20 ) Type in only the numerical portion of your answer, properly rounded to the correct number of sig figs, here.

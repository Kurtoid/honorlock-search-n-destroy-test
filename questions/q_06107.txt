Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. The histopathological spread of the disease is well documented, and techniques are now available to study the transcriptomic and biological pathways disrupted in AD brains. Researchers used hierarchical clustering techniques on RNASeq data to generate gene expression profiles across the temporal lobe (TL), frontal lobe(FL), parietal lobe (PL), and cerebellum (CB) brain regions of AD individuals (figure above). Based on the data provided in the heatmap above, what general characteristic or patterns of the expression data is responsible for grouping genes into Gene Set #1?

This is the 1st Non-multiple choice question.  You must do seven of the 12, and you may do eight for extra credit.  You MUST do #5 (humidity calculations) and at least one of #1, 4, and 7 (geologic time). 1. Hypothetically, suppose we have a radioactive isotope of 104Rh, (atomic number 45).  Figure out what isotope (including atomic mass number and atomic number) will result when 104Rh undergoes each of the following types of decay: alpha decay, beta decay, electron capture.  To help, a portion of the periodic table including Rh and several nearby elements is included below.      Figure 23 Note 1: the number at the bottom of each square is the atomic weight, and will not be used in this problem.Note 2: for simplicity, just enter your answers, do not give the equation.Note 3: just give the atomic symbol for the element.  DO NOT spell out the entire name of the element.

BONUS 5 points It was less than 100 years ago that scientists did not think that large molecules could exist.  Hermann Staudinger proposed the idea of long-chain molecules that he called macromolecules in 1920. At the time, many thought that any shear force would pull chemical bonds aparts, disallowing the existence of anything like a protein or synthetic polymer.  Staudinger finally won the Nobel Prize for his idea in 1953. Consider proteins and answer the following questions.  Name and describe the functional group in proteins and its stability in the carbonyl cascade. Describe the chemical structure of proteins - primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary - and how these are formed by chemical forces.

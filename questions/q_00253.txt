While in State A, a commuter from State A was driving home after a long day of work when she was severely injured when a limousine swerved into her car on an interstate highway, causing an accident. The limo driver is from State B, but he also rents an apartment in State A with several other limo drivers for times when they have to pick up passengers early in State A. In fact, the limo driver was driving to State A to spend the night at the apartment to pick up a passenger the next morning. The commuter comes to you for legal advice.

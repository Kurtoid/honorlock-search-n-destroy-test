The microsporidian Brachiola gambiae parasitizes the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Adult female mosquitoes must take blood meals in order for their eggs to develop, and it is while they take blood that they transmit malarial parasites to humans. Male mosquitoes drink flower nectar. If humans are to safely and effectively use Brachiola gambiae as a biological control to reduce human deaths from malaria, then how many of the following statements should be true?1. Brachiola should kill the mosquitoes before the malarial parasite they carry reaches maturity.2. Brachiola must be harmful to male mosquitoes, but not to female mosquitoes.3. Microsporidians should infect mosquito larvae, rather than mosquito adults.4. The subsequent decline in Anopheles gambiae should not significantly disrupt human food resources or other food webs.

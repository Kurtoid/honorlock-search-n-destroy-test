DIRECTIONS: Choose the correct answer for each question.Losing Nemo? Global Warming and the Clownfish[A] You may not have heard of the clownfish, but you would probably know it if you saw it. Whether in the shallow water near a coral reef or in an aquarium,1 many people would recognize the orange and white striped fish. "It's Nemo!" many kids might shout. [B] The colorful clownfish was made famous by the Disney animated film Finding Nemo, but in many ways, clownfish have become too popular for their own good. Because of their brilliant colors, many children - and adults too - have wanted their own Nemo for a pet. As a result, overfishing has become a serious problem. There is now the danger that the number of clownfish could greatly decrease.[C] Unfortunately, overfishing is not the only threat. Global warming has had a negative effect on the living environment of many sea creatures, including clownfish. It is important to remember that global warming does not just affect the Earth's atmosphere. Increased pollution by humans in the last 100 years has also warmed the seas. [D] Warmer waters are extremely bad news for many sea creatures, especially clownfish. The reason for this is the remarkable relationship that the clownfish has with the sea anemone2 - a type of sea life that is dying due to the warming seas.[E] Clownfish and sea anemones help each other in countless ways. For example, clownfish eat small animals that could be harmful to sea anemones. In return, sea anemones protect clownfish from predators with their poison. Sea anemones, however, are highly sensitive to the warming seas. In 2016 and 2017, half of the coral on Australia's Great Barrier Reef died in a marine heat wave - a sudden rise in sea temperatures. The sea anemones that lived on the coral died as well. This, of course, has had very negative consequences for clownfish. Scientists have noticed that the number of eggs released by clownfish in the Great Barrier Reef is now 73 percent lower than before the heat wave.[F] If the seas continue to warm, coral and sea anemones will continue to die. Without their partners, clownfish may become victims as well. Sadly, finding "Nemos" in the oceans may become increasingly difficult.1 An aquarium is a building where fish and other sea creatures are kept for display.2 Sea anemones are colorful plant-like creatures that live on coral.

Use the following cover letter from Resume Now. To Whom It May Concern,   I am applying for your opening for the Environmental Projects Coordinator position. I was born to get this job. Please let me explain why I am such a good match.   As a little girl, my two brothers and I used to go camping with my parents. We were taught to respect nature, and to this day there is nothing I love more than camping and the great outdoors. I even joined the Girl Scouts when I was young, so I could improve my camping and nature skills. I am proud to say that I earned many badges. Then, when I got older, I got caught up in trying to make money, and wound up spending the next ten years of my life working in accounting. I did well and got great reviews, but my heart wasn't in it. I used to sit and think about my next vacation, always feeling like something was missing.   And today, when I saw the listing for your job, I knew I had to write to you. I could feel it in my bones that your organization and this job were the right direction for me -- something I should have done ages ago. Since I read about your job, it's all I can think of. I really hope you are willing to give me a chance. I know if you do, I will have found the right job for me at last.   Please consider me seriously, despite my coming from a different background. I know I can do the job, and what I don't know yet I will learn quickly. Scout's honor! I can be reached at 555-078-1896 if you have any questions or want to explore this further.

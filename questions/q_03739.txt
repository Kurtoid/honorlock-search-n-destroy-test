A 0.177-kg softball pitched at 30.0 m/s is hit on a horizontal line drive straight back at the pitcher at 49.0 m/s. If the magnitude of the average force on the softball while it is in contact with the bat is 2480 N, how long in milliseconds was it in contact with the bat?
Two cylindrical rods, made of materials A and B, are placed end-to-end as shown in the figure.    Each rod is 240 cm in length with a radius of 10 cm. The top and bottom surfaces are insulated. A heat source and a heat sink is placed at either ends of the rod. The source generates energy at a rate of 500 W. You may assume all of this energy is conducted through the rod. At steady state, the temperature distribution in the rods are measured via 8 thermocouples. The temperatures obtained is tabulated below.    Material  x (cm) Temperature (K)   A 50 762.5   100 700   150 637.5   200 575   B 300 464   350 434   400 404   450 374    Based on the data provided, answer the following questions. Upload all your clearly written work.  Determine the temperature at the interface in material A and in material B. (Hint: Plot the temperature vs. x) What is the thermal contact resistance at the interface? Determine the thermal conductivities of the two materials.
c. (10 pts): What is the acceleration of the elevator if the applied force  (acting down)? (Again, text only version is fine for entry in this quiz, as long as it is clearly the same answer in your uploaded work.)

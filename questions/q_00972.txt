Consider two regions, United States (US) and European Union (EU). In 2014, US experienced high output growth (4%), whereas EU had modest output growth (1%). Suppose the Fed allowed the money supply to grow by 8% each year, whereas the European Central Bank (ECB) chose to maintain relatively high money growth of 2% per year. The real interest rate is 1% in each country. Suppose the Fed decreases the money growth rate from 8% to 6%. As a response, the ECB also decreases the money growth rate from 2% to 1%. Compute the change in the US nominal interest rate. Enter your answer in percent, omitting the "%" symbol. For 9%, you would write "9". For 1.5%, you would write "1.5". For -9%, you would write "-9".

For many years before the 1840's, America had claimed much of the great northwestern territory known as Oregon.  In fact, United States claims in Oregon date from as early as the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804-1806.  Nevertheless, until about 1840, few Americans were interested in the Oregon Country.  Moreover, the northern border of Oregon was a matter of long-standing dispute between the United States and Great Britain.             The Oregon country was rich in land and in natural resources.  Large parts of Oregon were heavily forested.  However, the few Americans settlers who went to Oregon before 1840 found that much of the land could be farmed.  Furthermore, early trappers soon made Oregon a center for the North American fur trade.  American trading companies such as the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, helped to open the country to later   settlement.  The trappers who worked for these companies discovered many trails and the mountain passes that later made overland to Oregon possible. During the early 1840's, wagon trains of American settlers reached Oregon in growing numbers.  Most pioneer families followed the overland route-the Oregon Trail-to the Columbia River and beyond.   7.

Despite earlier lack of interest in the Northwest Territory, by the 1840's, wagon trains of Americans reached Oregon in growing numbers. The Oregon country was rich in natural resources. Before 1840, many Americans started farms in the Northwest Territory known as Oregon.

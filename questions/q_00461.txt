Question 5a When filming a scene for a movie, the actors have to keep re-shooting the scene until the director is satisfied. Once the director is satisfied with the way the scene was recorded one time, the actors get to move on to the next scene.  For a particularly emotional scene, this particular director has a very specific vision of what the scene should look like, and so there is only a 15% chance that any one take will be satisfactory.  Because there are so many actors in the scene, the probability of the scene being satisfactory in any one take is exactly the same regardless of how many times the scene has been shot. What is the probability that the actors nail the scene on the first try and don't have to do another take? What distribution should be used to model this problem?

For the next three questions, assume that you have an implementation of SortedSet using a singly-linked list of nodes with a head and a tail reference. Each node thus just has a next reference. In this implementation, each data value D is positioned in increasing value order by the key K. Thus, the smallest value is at the head and largest value is at the tail. (Recall that a Set cannot have duplicate elements in it.) Assume that the set has n elements in it.

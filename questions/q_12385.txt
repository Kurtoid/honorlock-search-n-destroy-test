President Fubusa, of a small African nation, is arguing that his country needs to implement significant reforms in trade policy.  You have been retained as his adviser and are in charge of educating the president in these areas. Explain to him in an essay the debate surrounding free trade vs trade barriers.   Be sure to address BOTH economic and welfare effects (the  CS/PS stuff) of trade barriers to paint a full picture.  But, ALSO help him understand when it might make sense to retain trade barriers.  Be thorough and detailed, and use examples to illustrate your points.   **Make sure that your essay incorporates content from the current units. You can also incorporate content from older units.  You will be judged on the depth, accuracy, and persuasiveness of your explanation.  *This is a bit open-ended and you need to put some structure in place. **Expected length is about 1-1.25 pages (equivalent), single-spaced. I don't think you can do a good job with an essay that is much shorter.  ***Note that a few sentences is not sufficient to answer this question and will not earn you an acceptable score. ****Be detailed and be thorough. Assume that the president is not an economist and be thorough in your explanations, to a reasonable degree, and offering examples.  *****Content is the most important contributor to your grade. But writing quality counts too. I do not expect perfection from a timed essay. But I do expect that your work is proofread and major grammar errors and spelling errors are addressed.  SPEND A FEW MINUTES EDITING YOUR WORK BEFORE SUBMITTING.

[5 points] Consider an intersection with four approaches (e.g., NB, SB, EB, and WB). The intersection is designed such that EB L (Eastbound left) and WB L movements are prohibited at the intersection but instead are instructed to make a U-turn downstream of the intersection (followed by a right turn). All other movements are allowed. What is the rationale for this design? How do the numbers of three types of traffic "conflicts" change with this design (provide the numbers)? You are welcomed to draw any pictures to support your answer.    [5 points] Continuing the previous question, explain how the dual ring configuration can address the conflicts at the intersection. How many conflicts can be addressed by the "barrier" (focus on the most critical type of conflicts)? You are welcomed to draw any pictures to support your answer.

You will need to divide your page into two parts by drawing a horizontal line halfway down the page.  (There will be an upper half and a lower half of your page.) NOTE: Canvas will only allow you to upload ONE file, so it is recommended that all your answers fit onto one page. Free Response Question #1 (5 pts.,  Answer in the top half of your page) How many kilograms should an 2875 cm3 iron block weigh, if the density of iron is 7.874 g/cm3?    Show calculation using conversion factors, and express your answer in scientific notation with correct significant figures.   Free Response Question #2 (5 pts. Answer in the bottom half of your page). A 62.8 lb. child with severe allergies requires medication with a recommended daily dosage of 0.250 mg per kg of body weight.

A 100.0 mL sample of 0.300 M NaOH is mixed with a 100.0 mL sample of 0.300 M HNO3 in a coffee cup calorimeter. If both solutions were initially at 35.00degC and the temperature of the resulting solution was recorded as 37.00degC, determine the DHdegrxn (in units of kJ/mol NaOH) for the neutralization reaction between aqueous NaOH and HCl. Assume: 1) that no heat is lost to the calorimeter or the surroundings, and                2) that the density (1.00 g/mL) and the heat capacity (4.18 J/gdegC) of the                               resulting solution are the same as water.
6.00-kg of water at 60degC is brought to equilibrium with the environment, which we take to be a reservoir at 20degC.  What is the total change in entropy, of both the water and environment, when equilibrium is reached at 20degC? (Constants are at the top of the exam.)

2-kg air contained in a piston-cylinder device expands at constant pressure of 100-kPa while exchanging heat with its surroundings. It starts from 250oC and expands until its volume increases by 25%.  Assuming air as ideal gas with constant specific heat of cv = 0.762 kJ/, determine:   the initial volume of the air, in m3; the final temperature of the air, in oC; the amount of heat transferred between the air and its surrounding during this process, in kJ. Is it heat input or output?  Rair = 0.287 kJ/  Note:  Please do NOT type.  Please write and show your detailed work on paper.
Water and benzene are non miscible liquids; their boiling points are 100 degC and 80.1degC, respectively. A mixture of water/benzene cannot be separated by simple distillation technique because the boiling point difference is less than 40 degC.

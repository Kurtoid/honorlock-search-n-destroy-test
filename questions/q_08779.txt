Consider the tasks below to answer the following three questions.     First Arrival Deadline Period Execution Time   T1 0 3 3 1   T2 1 5 5 2   T3 3 7 7 3    (a) Test whether the tasks are schedulable on a single processor using Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling by applying necessary test. Based on the necessary test, predict if EDF can find a schedule (without violation). (b) Schedule the above tasks using Earliest Deadline First (EDF) up to 20 time steps. Use * to indicate subsequent task arrivals. If a task violates its deadline, only abandon that task at the time it violates the deadline, show the violation using 'X' mark, and proceed with the next highest priority one. In other words, the 'X' mark should be at the same position of * symbol, if violation happens. If the priority of a currently executing task is the same as the priority of a newly arrived task, continue to execute the current task. If the priorities of two tasks are the same and both are ready to execute, then always choose the one with the smaller execution time. The deadline and period values are relative to the arrival time. For example, if a task arrives in time step 2 with a deadline of 8, its actual deadline is timestep 10. Also, if a task arrives in time step 2 with a period of 8, it arrives next in timestep 10. Please prepare the schedule in any scratch paper and enter your answer in the following format (the numbers given below are random numbers for illustrative purposes only) showing all the arrival times, all violations (if any), as well as the actual schedules up to 20 time steps. T1 arrives at time 0, 11, 39, 73, 81 T2 arrives at time 1, 23, 45, 99 T3 arrives at time 3, 55, 75 T1 is scheduled during 0-1, 11-17, 81-99 T2 is scheduled during 1-55, 45-111 T3 is scheduled during 3-9, 55-77, 99 - 100 Schedule violation for T1 at time 34 Schedule violation for T2 at time 57, 43 (c) Based on the schedule above, comment on your prediction. For example, if you predicted no violation based on necessary test in (a), but there is task deadline violation in (b), justify the rationale (e.g., prediction is wrong because ...., or scheduling is wrong because ...).

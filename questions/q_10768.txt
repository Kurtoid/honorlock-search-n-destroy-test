The staff states they took the temps but there is no place to put the results on the form. As you observe the line, you notice they are using appropriate sized scoops, but are putting heaping amounts on each plate of the macaroni and cheese. Per the written menu the regular diet should receive apple pie and the cardiac diet should receive cinnamon apple slices. You notice everyone is receiving the apple pie.

In the walk in refrigerator, there is no thermometer present, several lids are not securely on the containers, the zucchini is moldy, and there is an open undated bag of cheese. As you are finishing your inspection, the foodservice director informs you they have had a roach problem. She has the staff pull apart the tray line where a large outlet is located.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is an important thermoplastic polymer used for many applications, such as soda/water bottles. PET does not crystallize easily, so soda bottles are usually transparent even though the polymer has some crystallinity; but this is because the crystallites are nanosized and too small to scatter light. The following DSC thermograms were measured for samples of PET that were annealed for various times.           - Which direction is exothermic, up or down? [1]   - Was the sample shown in thermogram (a) more or less crystalline than the samples shown in the thermograms of (b)? [2] - Which of these processing treatments would be best for keeping the fizz in these bottles (i.e., helping to reduce gas diffusion out)? Fill in blank from choice of A thru D: [3]    (A) quenched sample shown in the top thermogram of (a)      (B) crystallized/annealed at 383K for 1 hour (thermogram in (b))    (C) crystallized/annealed at 383K for 2 hour (thermogram in (b))    (D) crystallized/annealed at 383K for 5 hour (thermogram in (b)) - The Tc peaks, which are (endothermic / exothermic) [4], seem to occur over a broad range of temperatures, as compared to the Tm peak. This is because this Tc arises from a (hot / cold) [5] crystallization process that occurs as the temperature is ramped up during the DSC scan, in contrast to Tc's that are normally measured as a melt is cooled down to crystallize. The rising temperature provides mobility such that the chains can try to organize into their lower energy conformations, which in this case would be (random coils / liquid crystals / lamellar crystallites) [6]. In both cases of Tc measurement, the Tc temperature is not a material property, as is the Tm, but simply depends on the temperature and kinetics of the phase transformation.

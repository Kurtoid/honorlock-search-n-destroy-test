On March 31, 2021, M. Belotti purchased the right to remove gravel from an old rock quarry. The gravel is to be sold as roadbed for highway construction. The cost of the quarry rights was $164,000, with estimated salable rock of 20,000 tons. During 2021, Belotti loaded and sold 4,000 tons of rock and estimated that 16,000 tons remained at December 31, 2021. At January 1, 2022, Belotti estimated that 20,000 tons still remained. During 2022, Belotti loaded and sold 8,000 tons. Belotti uses the units-of-production method.   Belotti would record depletion in 2021 of:

Signal transduction pathways convert extracellular stimuli into specific cellular responses. Typically, signal transduction begins with a signal to a receptor and ends with a change in cell function. Sometimes, there is a cascade of signals within the cell. With each step of the cascade, the signal can be amplified, so a small signal can result in a large response. Eventually, the signal creates a change in the cell, either in the expression of the DNA in the nucleus or in the activity of enzymes in the cytoplasm. The passage of signals back and forth between different pathways is referred to as _________.

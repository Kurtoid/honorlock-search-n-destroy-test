Three 3 phase loads are connected in parallel. One is a purely resistive load connected in wye. It consumes 300kW. The second is a purely inductive 300kVAR load connected in wye. The third is a purely capacitive 300kVAR load connected in wye. The line -to-line voltage at the load is 5kV. A 3 phase distribution line supplying this load has an impedance of 10+j5 ohms per phase.  (a) Calculate the currents drawn by each load (magnitude and phase). (b) Indicate the power factor of each load. Remember that non - unity power factors must also include whether they are lagging or leading. (c) What is the power factor of the entire load?

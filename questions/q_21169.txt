I know that purple is the dominant flower color in a particular plant, but I am unsure if the plant I have is homozygous dominant or heterozygous recessive. Describe what I would do to determine the genotype of my plant.

Please answer the following questions. As you have studied in the lecture, we have one pseudocode instruction of MIPS architecture to extend existing instructions as follows:   The new "AddSubT" instruction indicates that it carries out one addition (Rv+Rs) from two registers before it subtracts one register from a third (Rt).  Add = addition, Sub = subtract, T = third.                  addsubt Rd, Rs, Rt, Rv        # Rd = Rv + Rs - Rt It will use R-format to share shamt field as follows to hold Rv.    op Rs Rt Rd Shamt/Rv func   bits 31-26 25-21 20-16 15-11 10-6 5-0    Please precisely and clearly answer the following questions.  Unclear answers will NOT receive points. (1). Based on the following multiple cycles of datapath taught in the lecture, please revise and modify the datapath to support this new "addsubt" instruction.  Please do NOT modify the main functional components (such as ALU, memory, and register file). Please add/insert necessary wires and components to the datapath. You MUST specify what are inputs, outputs, control signals of your components?  To show the wires of connection, please indicate their connections (for instance, connect a to c, and connect f to e, in the following datapath). Please clearly describe how you insert your components to make the new instruction functions within this datapath.  (2). There is a paragraph of MIPS code using this new "addsubt" instruction as follows with 24 cycles (called Code 1 with addsubt).  Please program MIPS code (called Code 2 without addsubt) to implement same functions, but the "addsubt" instruction is avoided. It requires that Code 1 be 1/8 faster than Code 2. Code 1 (with addsubt) lw $t0, 0($v0) lw $t3, 4($v0) lw $t5, 8($v0) addsubt $t6, $t5, $t3, $t2 sw $t6, 0($v1) (3). If it is assumed to implement this new "addsubt" instruction in the pipelined datapath, then please precisely specify what difficulties you would overcome to implement it? Please precisely explain why? Please indicate what kind of hazards it would have?

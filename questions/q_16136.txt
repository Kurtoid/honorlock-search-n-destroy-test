QM 292 Exam #3 Sickdays Fall 2020.docx  Open the link above.  The number of employee sick days is costly to any corporation.  Corporations monitor the number of employee sick days very closely and, as such, adopt various policies and incentives to minimize the number of days an employee calls in sick.  The Blackstone Group (a multi-billion-dollar financial investment corporation - yes - this is a real corporation and -no- I am not related) collects data on 233 employees.  The Blackstone Group is interested in predicting the number of employee sick days.        Dependent Variable:  Number of Sick Days taken in the current year       Independent Variables:  Employee hourly pay, Sick days taken last year (Sick_LastYr), and whether the employee exercises at least 30 minutes per day.  Exercise? =1 if employee exercises 30 minutes per day, 0 = otherwise.  a. Does the coefficient on 'Exercise?' have the correct sign? Why or why not? b. Is the coefficient on 'Sick_LastYr' statistically significant? You must justify your answer. c. Calculate the marginal effect on 'the number of sick days taken this year' if the Blackstone Group implemented a $2/hour increase in hourly pay. Interpret your result. d.  Identify another independent variable you would include in the model.  You must provide a justification for why  you would include this variable?

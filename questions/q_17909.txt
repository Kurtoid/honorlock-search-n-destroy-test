A local municipality has contracted with your firm to design an induced-draft, counter-current, ammonia stripping tower at their water reclamation facility that has a permitted capacity of 5.0 MGD. Pertinent design data as follows:  Average air and water temperature: 20 degC Wastewater pH: 11.0 Local atmospheric pressure: 725 mmHg Design hydraulic loading: 2.5 gpm/ft2 Design/theoretical air flow: 1.70 From the table, the partial pressure of ammonia at 20 degC is 0.03 mmHg and the ammonia concentration in the wastewater at 20 degC is 50x10-6 gNH3/gH2O.     (5 pts) Determine the equilibrium mass of ammonia in the air (Y2) (5 pts) Determine the air to water ratio (lb Air/lb H2O). (5 pts) If the G/L=2.0613 lb Air/lb H2O, determine the theoretical air required (Gtheor) (unit: lb Air/ft2*hr). Hint: determine the mass flow rate of water (L) first. (5 pts) If the theoretical air required (Gtheor) is 2,580 lb Air/ft2*hr, determine the "design" air required (lb Air/ft2*hr).  (5 pts) If the design air flow required is determined to be 750 cfm/ft2, what is the design air flow required (Air/Gallon)? (unit: ft3/gallon)

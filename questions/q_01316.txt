We fade up on a Porsche. In the passenger seat is Brad (Johnny Depp). The driver, a primly dressed woman. He says, "Shall we do it?" She agrees, starts up the car and drives into a huge, gated estate. Inside, we find the library and the girl's old father behind a tank of a desk. He asks his daughter to step outside; he wants to have a private word with Brad. Once she leaves, he says, "you're not going to marry my daughter." Brad argues, "I've asked her to marry me, she loves me." The old man takes 20,000 dollars out of the desk and spreads it out in front of Brad, "you're not going to marry my daughter." Brad's totally insulted, "she's old enough, we don't need your permission." Another 20,000 is added to the pile. Brad is more righteous, "How dare you sir! You can't buy love!" The old man shoves another heap of bills onto the pile, "you're not going to marry my daughter." Brad looks at the mountain of bills, glances out to the cobblestone drive, thinks a moment and says, "Throw in the Porsche." Cut to the autumn leaves flying as Brad pulls out of town in the Porsche. (1)   This is a movie about a handsome kid who's got the perfect con...he goes into a town, finds the richest girl, gets her to fall in love with him, makes sure the parents hate him and gets paid off not to marry into the family. It's Don Juan di Marco meets Music Man. A few days later, Brad's in the islands, enjoying his loot. Pool bar--Oprah's on television. Suddenly he sees a composite picture of himself and Oprah interviewing his last "love" victims. They're all happy that they knew him, for they all learned about men and love through him. But they want his private parts. (2) He realizes the game is up, and decides to pull one last, major con before retirement. He has to find the one place in the country where the women are interested, their fathers are wealthy and no one watches Oprah. The answer--Stanford. His goal, the daughter of the President of the United States. (3)   At Stanford, it takes no time for the President's shy daughter to fall madly in love with him. He's invited to the White House and begins to turn the family against him - he makes a pass at the first lady, the President, and the downstairs maid. But, back at school, there's a problem - he keeps seeing a pretty graduate student who seems to be following him (maybe Secret Service, maybe a reporter). He finally confronts her and she admits that she saw him on Oprah. (4) But she doesn't want to turn him in. Instead she wants to write her graduate thesis on the mating habits of the American male with Brad as the star specimen. Or else she'll bust him. He agrees. The con continues. What structural part of the story does (4) indicate?
Questions 35-38 refer to a large truck which breaks down out on the road and receives a push back to town by a small compact car.  Pick one of the choices A through J below which correctly describes the forces between the car and the truck for each of the descriptions (questions 35-38). A.

The force of the car pushing against the truck is less than that of the truck pushing back against the car. C.  The force of the car pushing against the truck is greater than that of the truck pushing back against the car. D.

Neither the car nor the truck exert any force on each other. The truck is pushed forward simply because it is in the way of the car. J.  None of these descriptions is correct.

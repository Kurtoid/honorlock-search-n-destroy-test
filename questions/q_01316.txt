11. Which of the following is true? A. In order to discuss assisted suicide, Daniel Callahan adopts what he calls "an ecological approach" to moral questions. And so, he asks us to think of assisted suicide as a seemingly attractive flower that we contemplate planting in the meadow that is our society. Then, to assess assisted suicide, we ask whether the plant would take root and flourish in its own right and what it will do to the other plants in the meadow that is our society.  B. Daniel Callahan suggests that, because assisted suicide encourages people to think in a positive way about death, if we legalize PAS then people will be prone to commit murder since people will not treat death as something which is fundamentally bad.  C. Daniel Callahan argues that if euthanasia is legalized, this would result in an increased rate of abortion across the country because the legalization of euthanasia would require that the U.S. alter its current laws about killing to make these laws more flexible and lenient, which would allow for abortions to be deemed legal under more conditions than they currently are deemed legal.  D. Although Daniel Callahan challenges the idea that PAS is morally justified due to considerations about rights and self-determination, Callahan does not challenge the idea the PAS is morally justified due to considerations about compassion.

QUESTION 4     Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.         4.1   Name the law of physics that is stated above.   (2)     4.2   The gravitational force between the two bodies with mass 1 and mass 2 respectively is F. The distance between the centres of the bodies is r meters.

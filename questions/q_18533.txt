ESSAY QUESTION NUMBER TWO Suggested allocation of time:  90 minutes.              Robopath is a Romanian startup company headquartered in Bucharest, the capital of Romania.  Romania is located in eastern Europe and is a member of the European Union.  Robopath has invented software that will absorb the content of scanned documents and transfer the data into Excel spreadsheets.  The software is a kind of robotic process automation (RPA) and makes life much easier for office workers who otherwise would have to enter by hand the data from any document they receive in a form that doesn't permit the export of its data.              Robopath sells its software over the internet to business customers worldwide, including to business customers in the United States.  Robopath's software has been especially helpful during the Covid pandemic as employees work remotely.  Robopath has no physical presence in the United States; its only offices and all of its employees are located in Bucharest.              Robopath is the brainchild of Michael Mines, who once worked at MicroSoft.  Michael is a Romanian national.  Robopath has another American connection:  Accel, Inc., a US venture capital firm, was an early investor in the company and an executive of Accel, Victoria Wang, has a seat on the board of directors of Robopath.              Although Robopath has yet to make a profit, its software is seen as quite promising and sales during the Covid pandemic increased significantly.  On the strength of its technology and favorable sales trend, Robopath recently sold stock on the New York Stock Exchange in an initial public offering (IPO).  Although Robopath sold only a small percentage of its total stock outstanding, the price fetched by those shares valued the entire firm at about $3 billion.              All is not bliss in Bucharest, however.  Robopath has been sued in federal court in New York by one of its original investors.  The investor, Georgette Ambani, a citizen of India who lives in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, alleges that Robopath breached its Stock Investment Agreement with her when it refused to include part of her stockholding in the company's recent IPO.  Ms. Ambani also alleges that Robopath's actions violated US federal securities law.                The Stock Investment Agreement between Robopath and Ms. Ambani is identical to the agreements that Robopath has with its other original backers, including Accel, Inc.  Each of the agreements includes a provision that requires arbitration of any dispute between the investor and Robopath in London under the arbitration rules of the London Centre for Arbitration with English law to be applied by the arbitrators.  English investment law is well developed, although its remedies aren't as generous as those under US securities law.  The clause prohibits class arbitration.              Robopath has a second headache.  It has received a demand letter from Edward Cranbrook, who states that Robopath's software infringes on his US patent for another kind of RPA (robotic process automation).  Mr. Cranbrook insists that Robopath stop its infringement immediately and pay him $1.5 million to compensate him for its past infringement of his patent.  Mr. Cranbrook's letter gives a Seattle address.              A bit of research has shown that Mr. Cranbrook has not commercialized his patent.  He has instead brought an average of 120 lawsuits each year alleging infringement of his patent.  He chooses start-up companies as defendants in the belief that they will settle out of court to save the expense of an adequate legal defense.  He does not sue well-established companies with the resources to defend against his claims.              Before Mr. Cranbrook hit upon his present strategy, he lost three patent infringement cases in California against well-funded defendants.  The three judgments are public record.  The most recent judgment includes a pronouncement from the court that the courts of California are now closed to Mr. Cranbrook for a period of three years under a state statute denying access to the state's court system to plaintiffs who have brought multiple frivolous patent infringement claims.              Robopath has now approached your law firm about these two matters.  Your supervising attorney has asked you the following questions:    Does the federal court in New York have personal jurisdiction over Robopath? Does US federal securities law reach Robopath's financial transactions? What law would the federal court in New York apply to Ms. Ambani's contract claims? Will the federal court in New York enforce the arbitration clause in Ms. Ambani's contract with Robopath and dismiss the action? If Robopath were to bring an action in federal court in the state of Washington for a declaratory judgment against Mr. Cranbrook that Robopath's software does not infringe his patent, what would be the effect on Robopath's proceeding of the judgments on record in California against Mr. Cranbrook? If Robopath were successful in obtaining a declaratory judgment against Mr. Cranbrook, is there any impediment to Robopath enforcing that judgment in other US states in the event that Mr. Cranbrook brings suit against Robopath alleging the infringement of his patent?

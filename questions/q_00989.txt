DIRECTIONS: Choose the correct answer for each question. The Travels of Ibn Battuta [A] "I left Tangier, my birthplace, the 13th of June, 1325, with the intention of making the pilgrimage [to Mecca] ... to leave all my friends both female and male, to abandon my home as birds abandon their nests." So begins an old manuscript in a library in Paris - the travel journal of Ibn Battuta.[B] Almost two centuries before Columbus, this young Moroccan set off for Mecca, returning home three decades later. Ibn Battuta is now regarded as one of history's great travelers. Driven by curiosity, he journeyed to remote corners of the Islamic world, traveling three times as far as Marco Polo, through 44 modern countries. He is little celebrated in some parts of the world, yet his name is well known among Arabs. In his hometown of Tangier, a square, a hotel, a cafe, a ferry boat, and even a hamburger are named after him. [C] Prior to his adventures traveling the world, Ibn Battuta studied in Mecca for several years. However, the urge to travel soon took over. He traveled to India, seeking profitable employment with the Sultan of Delhi. On the way, he described his group being attacked in the open country by 80 foot soldiers and two horsemen: "we fought ... killing one of their horsemen and about twelve of the foot soldiers. ... I was hit by an arrow and my horse by another, but God in his grace preserved me."[D] In Delhi, the sultan gave him the position of judge, based on his studies at Mecca. But the sultan had an unpredictable character, and Ibn Battuta was soon looking for an opportunity to leave. When the sultan offered to finance a trip to China, Ibn Battuta agreed. He set off in three ships, but misfortune struck while he was still on shore. A sudden storm grounded and broke up two of the ships. Scattering treasure, the storm drowned many people and horses. As he watched, the third ship, with all his belongings and slaves, was carried out to sea and never heard from again.[E] After a lifetime of adventures, Ibn Battuta was finally ordered by the Sultan of Morocco to return home to share his wisdom with the world. Fortunately, he consented and wrote a book that has been translated into numerous languages, allowing people everywhere to read about his incredible journeys. Which of the following is true about Ibn Battuta?

Cement and reinforcing steel rebars are essential materials for constructing a reinforced concrete building. At a given location, the probability of shortage of cement and rebars are 0.1 and 0.05, respectively. However, if cement is not available, the probability of shortage of rebars is increased to 0.2. Consider the following two events:                 C: cement not available (shortage of cement)                 S: steel rebars not available (shortage of rebars) a) What is the probability that both cement and rebars are not available? b) What is the probability that there will be shortage of either of construction material? c) If rebars or cement are not available, what is the probability of shortage of both materials?

One interesting finding is that horseback riding has the highest rate of traumatic brain injuries of all sports, at 15.3%.  You decide to see if Wyoming's horseback riders have a different rate than the rate for the nation.  You record all the horse related injury admissions from emergency rooms across the state, and find the following confidence interval for the proportion that are traumatic brain injuries, 0.152 < p < 0.216.   What is the sample proportion?   [sampp] Can you claim that Wyoming has a higher rate of traumatic brain injuries than the national rate?  [diff] If you wanted to decrease your error to 2.5%, how large of a sample do you need? [samps]

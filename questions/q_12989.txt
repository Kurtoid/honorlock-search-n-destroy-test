In a recombination test, T4 mutant phage r101 and r102 were crossed (both strains are 10^6). The cross was first incubated in E.coli B, followed by dilution of this cross 10^4 and plated on E.coli B and 10^2 diluted in E.coli K12lambda. From the plates below calculate recombination frequency using equation RF= 2(plaques in E.coli K12lambda)/ plaques in E.coliB   E.coli B                                                            E.coli K12 lambda

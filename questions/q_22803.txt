Challenging With corporate bonds, we need to recognize two key current trends:  First, when corporations issue bond, they issue them at par. That is, for a bond with a $1,000 face value, they set the coupon rate high enough such that the price of the bond is also $1,000. Second, in recent years, corporations have been primarily issuing callable bonds without a call premium. That is, corporations reserve the right to purchase the bonds for their $1,000 face value!  Consider a perpetual bond that is callable after one year and pays annual coupons. The current (one year) interest rate for the bond is [Rb] percent. In one-year, the long-term interest rate for the bond will either be a high [Ru] percent or a low [Rd] percent. The interest rate has a [P] percent probability of being high. If the interest rate is low (i.e., equal to [Rd]), the bond will be called for its $1,000 face value. What coupon rate should the corporation set in order to be able to issue them at par? (Enter your answer as a percentage, rounded to the fourth decimal place. E.g., enter 0.123445 as 12.3445)

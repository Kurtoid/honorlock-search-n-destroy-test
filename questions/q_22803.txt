Section 8: Urban Growth/City Size Consider a region with a workforce of 12 million in a single city. The urban utility curve reaches its maximum with 3 million workers and includes the following combinations (W = workers; U = utility in $):      W 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12   U 32 56 70 65 60 55 50 45 40 35 30 25    Suppose the government establishes a new city with 1 million workers, leaving 11 million workers in the old city.

[4 points] Immediately following the establishment of the new city, the utility in the small city is ______________ and the utility in the large old city is ______________.  [8 points] In the long-run equilibrium, the workforce of the new city = ______________  with utility = ______________ ; the workforce of the old city = ______________ with utility = ______________ .

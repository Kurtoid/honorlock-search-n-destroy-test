The ABC Widget Integrated Supply Chain Consider the following scenario for the ABC Widget Integrated Supply Chain: a multi-tiered supply chain consisting of a Wholesaler (W), a Retailer (R), and a Manufacturer (M). The Wholesaler  supplies a product to a Retailer (R), which, in turn, sells the product to end Customers (C). C pays R $16.50 per unit. R pays W $9.00 per unit. W pays the Manufacturer (M) $6.40 per unit. The costs to M are $3.75/unit. Note that ABC Widget sales are seasonal and unsold widgets are marked down to $1.00 after the end of the season. Use the Newsvendor Model to deter mine answer The optimal service level for the integrated supply chain is:   This Problem Counts 3 Points.

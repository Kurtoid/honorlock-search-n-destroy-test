QUESTION 4    A D&D will often have a prop in the form of a grid. On each square, you can place a non-player character (NPC). The NPC is played (controlled) by the Dungeon Master.  When the player's character arrives on the same square something happens.   Open the DungeonGrid_p in the Question4 Folder. On the form is a 5x4 grid representing a rather small dungeon.      The game could be saved in a text file, each square being represented by a character and separated by a #. X - is an empty square M - is a Minotaur NPC U  - is a Unicorn P1 - is the Player's Character and the number that follows is the player's ID.  The text file would look like this P2#X#X#X#X# X#M#X#X#X# X#X#X#U#P1# X#X#X#X#X#   In the form, 2 global arrays have been declared. One is an array of dynamic panels the other is a 2D array of strings. The btnLoad has already been coded for you. This fills the 2D array with the characters as in the text file (although not from the text file).     4.1) The btnDisplayGridClick procedure has been partially coded. But the part that sets the panels top left corner has not been coded. You need to complete that code.    (15)   4.2) You need to write the code for the bntDisplay which will update the panel's caption to display the strings in the 2D array. Your code should be efficient and easily adapted to any size grid. Right-click on the button below to see what it should look like after all 3 buttons have been clicked.

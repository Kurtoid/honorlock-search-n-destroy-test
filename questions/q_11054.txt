Q31-32 refer to the information below: In a cross between a pure bred corn plant that had full, purple seeds and a pure bred plant that had shrunken, yellow seeds all the F1 progeny had full, purple seeds. When these F1 plants were crossed with each other the following results were obtained:                full, purple                 full, yellow                shrunken, purple                 shrunken, yellow                      925                               275                                 280                                      120             (total = 1600)   In the following questions you will use the chi-square test to determine whether the genes for seed shape and color are linked or unlinked.   Q31. Which of the following are the correct expected values for the progeny in this cross that would need to be used in calculating the chi-square value?

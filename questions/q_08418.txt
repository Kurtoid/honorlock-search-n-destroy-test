We studied hardware support that is provided by modern processor architectures to protect TCB data and code from untrusted user code. More specifically, we examined in detail the hardware support provided by successive generations of Intel processors. Answer the following questions for these processors. Provide a brief explanation that justifies your answer.  In the protected mode, what segment protection level (SPL) and page protection level (PPL) is used for kernel code that must execute with highest privilege? (3  pts.)  Kernel code in a segment with DPL = 0 will always execute with current privilege level (CPL) = 0. True or false. Explain your answer. (3  pts.)  User code running at CPL = 3 can access data in pages with page protection level (PPL) = 0. True or false. Explain your answer. (3 pts.)  With the VT-x virtualization extensions, at what hardware privilege level (or ring) does the guest operating system  run when the hypervisor is Type I? Assume that ring is defined by the CPL value.  (3 pts.)  In the absence of virtualization support, would a guest OS be fully virtualized or para-virtualized? In what ring would a guest OS execute in such a system? (3 pts.)  With the SGX extensions, secure code can run in an enclave. In what execution ring does code in an enclave run? (3  pts.)  In VT-x, hardware support for virtualization utilizes four-level extended page tables (EPTs) to translate guest-physical addresses to actual physical addresses. When page size is 4KB, such a paging structure can translate 48-bit addresses. If we add another level to EPTs, we have a page map level 5 table or PML5 which has pointers to PML4 tables in EPTs. What size addresses can be translated after this addition of PML5? Assume page size remains the same and explain your answer. (5 pts.)

"The Case of the Non-attending Student" James worked beautifully with his interpreter during the second and third grades.  When she went on maternity leave in the spring, the school replaced her with an older woman from their substitute interpreter list.  The substitute interpreter was hired later during the summer when the full-time interpreter decided not to return in the fall.  James's attitude toward his new interpreter, Mrs. Ross, was unconscionable.  He informed her on the first day of the school term that he didn't want her for an interpreter and would refuse to watch her.  He stubbornly demanded that his favorite interpreter, Beth, be returned to her former role. Mrs. Ross spoke to the administrator after the first week of school and called again during the second week to indicate that neither she nor the classroom teacher could secure James's attention.  James's refusal to participate with the interpreter made the whole class uncomfortable.  Both the teacher and the interpreter were at a loss as to the best approach to use with James. What should happen first:

The police department in a large city has 178 new officers to be apportioned among six high crime precincts.  The modified quotas are given for each of the precincts.  Use Adam's method to apportion the new officers.  How many officers will precinct C receive?
Here are the main points for an informative speech about the history of the @ symbol. I. The first recorded use of the @ symbol was in 1536 to represent units of wine. II. In later centuries, the @ symbol was used to mean "at the rate of" or "at the cost of." III. Today's @ symbol came into use in 1971 in the first e-mail ever sent. These main points are arranged in __________ order.

In this question, we consider the execution of a loop shown below in a statically scheduled superscalar processor. To simplify the problem, assume that any combination of instruction types can execute in the same cycle, e.g., in a 3-issue superscalar, the three instructions can be 3 ALU operations, 3 branches, 3 load/store instructions, or any combination of these instructions. Note that this only removes a resource constraint, but data and control dependences must still be handled correctly.   Loop:    ADDI R1,R1,4 LW R2,0(R1) LW R3,16(R1) ADD R2,R2,R1 ADD R2,R2,R3 BEQ R2,zero,Loop   (a) If many (e.g., 10,000) iterations of this loop are executed, determine the fraction of all register reads that are useful in a 2-issue static superscalar processor. The number of useful register reads for an instruction is defined as the total number of register file reads minus the number of registers that are forwarded from prior instructions. Hint: Note that all register read ports are active in every cycle by default, so 2 register read events happen in every cycle for a 2 issue architecture. Also, you will have to draw the multi-cycle pipeline diagram for instructions in the loop to accurately estimate the % of useful reads (the diagram can be on your scratch paper and does not need to be recreated in the text box where you enter the final answer, but you should indicate the useful reads for each instruction in the loop, if you want to get partial credit). (b) If many (e.g., 10,000) iterations of this loop are executed, determine the fraction of all register reads that are useful in a 3-issue static superscalar processor. (again, the diagram can be on your scratch paper and does not need to be recreated in the text box where you enter the final answer, but you should indicate the useful reads for each instruction in the loop, if you want to get partial credit).

Aerospace Manufacturing (Canvas Q16~22, Handwritten Pages Q16/19/20) Titanium is a very versatile metal, finding many uses in various forms in mechanical engineering. Building safe and long-lasting aircraft and spacecraft requires specialized materials that are strong and resistant to corrosion, yet relatively lightweight. Titanium alloys fit these requirements nicely, and are very widely used in the aerospace industry as a result; one type of titanium alloy, Ti-6Al-4V, makes up about 50% of all metal alloys used in airplanes! In order to make pure titanium metal, it must first be extracted from titanium-containing ores. The most important titanium ore, ilmenite (FeTiO3), is processed via reaction with chlorine gas as shown below. 2 FeTiO3 (s) + 7 Cl2 (g) + 6 C (s,graphite) - 2 TiCl4 (l) + 2 FeCl3 (s) + 6 CO (g)                    DHdeg = ? The standard enthalpy of formation of solid ilmenite is estimated to be DHdegf(FeTiO3) = -295.[a] kcal/mol. Calculate the standard enthalpy of reaction for the above reaction as written, in units of kilojoules.

"In 1945 I had ordered the A Bomb dropped on Japan at two places devoted almost exclusively to war production.  We were at war.  We were trying to end it in order to save the lives of our soldiers and sailors. . . .  We stopped the war and saved thousands of causalities on both sides.  In Korea we area fighting a police action with sixteen allied nations to support the World Organization which has set up the Republic of Korea.  We had held the Chinese after defeating the North Koreans and whipping the Russian Air Force.  I just could not make the order for a Third World War.  I know I was right." ~~Harry S Truman, from Off the Record: The Private Papers of Harry S Truman     (Refer to the passage.)  According to President Truman, what was the main difference between using the atomic bomb on Japan in 1945 and the possibility of using it on China in 1951?

A load cell is made of 4 strain gauges in a "Full Bridge" Wheatstone bridge circuit. All the strain gages are attached to the load cell's elastic member and all have a nominal resistance of 300 Ohm at zero strain. After the elastic member is loaded the resistance of each strain gauge is measured below. SG1: 301 Ohm;   SG2: 301 Ohm;   SG3=299 Ohm;   SG4=299 Ohm If Strain Gauge #1 (SG1) is wired as Resistor #1 (R1) in the Wheatstone bridge circuit below determine a suitable location for the remaining strain gauges in order for the load cell to function properly.

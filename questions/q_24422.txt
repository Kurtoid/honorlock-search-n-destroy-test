Antojos           An old woman emerged at last from a         shack behind the cabana, buttoning up a         torn housedress, and followed closely by         a little boy, who kept ducking behind her 5      whenever Yolanda smiled at him. Asking         his name just drove him further into the         folds of the old woman's skirt.           "You must excuse him, Dona," she         apologized. "He's not used to being 10   among people." But Yolanda knew the         old woman meant not the people in the         village, but the people with money who         drove through Altamira to the beaches on         the coast. "Your name," the old woman 15   repeated, as if Yolanda hadn't asked him         in Spanish. The little boy mumbled at the         ground. "Speak up!" the old woman         scolded, but her voice betrayed pride         when she spoke up for him. "This little 20   know-nothing is Jose Duarte Sanchez y         Mella Garcia."           Yolanda laughed. Not only were those a         lot of names for such a little boy, but they         certainly were momentous: the surnames 25   of the three liberators of the country!           "Can I serve the Dona in any way?" the         woman asked. Yolanda gave the tree line         beyond the woman's shack a glance.         "You think you might have some guavas 30   around?"           The old woman's face scrunched up.         "Guavas?" she murmured and thought to         herself a second. "Why, they're all         around, Dona. But I can't say as I've 35   seen any."           "With your permission--" Jose Duarte         had joined a group of little boys who had         come out of nowhere and were milling         around the car, boasting how many 40   automobiles they had ridden in. At         Yolanda's mention of the guavas, he         sprung forward, pointing across the road         towards the summit of the western hills.         "I know where there's a whole grove of 45   them." Behind him, his little companions         nodded.           "Go on, then!" His grandmother stamped         her foot as if she were scatting a little         animal. "Get the Dona some."   50   A few boys dashed across the road and         disappeared up a steep path on the         hillside, but before Jose could follow,         Yolanda called him back. She wanted to         go along too. The little boy looked 55   towards his grandmother, unsure of what         to think. The old woman shook her head.         The Dona would get hot, her nice clothes         would get all dirty. Jose would get the         Dona as many guavas as she was 60   wanting.           "But they taste so much better when         you've picked them yourself," Yolanda's         voice had an edge, for suddenly, it was         as if the woman had turned into the long 65   arm of her family, keeping her away from         seeing her country on her own.                   pear-shaped fruit             Adapted from "Antojos," by Julia Alvarez.

Explicate the poem, similar to your presentations but in a shortened form, below.  Quote lines, words, and/or cite line numbers for support.  From the MLA Handbook (8th edition):   "If you quote part or all of a line of verse that does not require special emphasis, put it in quotation marks within your text, just as you would a line of prose.  You may also incorporate two or three lines in this way, using a forward slash with a space on each side ( / ) to indicate to your reader where the line breaks fall.  ... Cullen concludes, "Of all the things that happened there / That's all I remember." ...If a stanza break occurs in the quotation, mark it with two forward slashes ( // )."

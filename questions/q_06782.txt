A 65-year male Mr. M, was in good health until he lost control of his car and suffered head trauma. While hospitalized in the intensive care unit during recovery, he developed hospital-acquired pneumonia. During his stay in hospital, Mr. M began to show signs of depression and was treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. His depression was not lessened in 2 weeks and the dosage of the antidepressant was increased. 7 days after his dosage increase, his nurse noted the patient exhibited confusion and lethargy. Mr. M's blood pressure was slightly elevated. His basic blood work showed the following: Serum sodium: 121 mEq/L, decreased Blood urea nitrogen: 9 mg/dL, decreased Serum chloride: 85 mEq/L, decreased Serum uric acid: 2.2 mg/dL, decreased.   The rest of his electrolytes and chemistry panel blood tests were normal, in addition to his thyroid and cortisol tests all being in normal range. Mr. M's physician then ordered a serum and a urine osmolarity and a urine sodium level. He was started on a water restriction regimen and was given a saline IV and saline PEG tube flushes were begun. The serum osmolarity was low, while the urine osmolarity was elevated and the urine sodium was elevated. Questions:  What condition has hypotonic plasma, with lower serum osmolarity and higher urine osmolarity and an elevated urine sodium level with a lower plasma sodium level?

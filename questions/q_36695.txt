On the Excel spreadsheet, there are two matrices (Matrix A and Matrix B) highlighted in yellow on the "Exam2-Q51" tab (for 5-(1) to 5-(3)) and the "Exam2-Q52" tab (for 5-(4)). Complete the following matrix operations: (1) Calculate [C]=[A]*[B] using Excel formula in the designated blue area; (2) Calculate the Determinant of Matrix A using Excel formula in the designated blue area; (3) Get the transpose of Matrix A using a VBA program; (4) On the "Exam2-Q52" tab, calculate [C]=[A]*[B] using a VBA program.   The algorithm for the transpose of a matrix [A] is: Transpose matrix AT (j,i) = A (i,j)   The algorithm for matrix multiplication is: For i = 1 to (number)             For j = 1 to (number)                         For k = 1 to (number)                                  C (i,j) = C (i,j) + A (i,k)* B (k,j)                         Next k             Next j Next i Note: The first two sub-questions, (1) and (2), are Excel spreadsheet problems, and no programming is required. The code/formulas should be written such that values in blue change correctly if the values in yellow change and the code is re-executed. Once complete, please type a one-word essay (e.g., "ok") for this question and then upload your combined Excel file at the very end of this exam.

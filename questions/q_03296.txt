a) Pick two points (NOT data points!) that lie on the line of best fit for your lnP vs 1/T graph, and show the work for calculating the slope, including units.  b) Using the equation below, calculate the heat of vaporization of water, in kJ/mole, using 8.314 J/mol K for R. Show all work including units, placing m, [?]H and R next to values in parentheses. For example, where R is used, 8.314 J/mol/K (R) should be written. If these directions are not followed, a score of 0 will be awarded.  m =  -[delta H/R]

How to Stay Awake During Class     As a new college student, one of the most difficult parts of college is staying awake during class. In college, some instructors would not think twice about counting a student absent for sleeping during their class. There are different reasons why students have a hard time staying awake during class. With late nights, eight a.m. classes, and boring instructors, students must find any means possible to stay alert. Three steps to ensure students stay awake are to participate in class, to find creative ways to wake up, and to physically wake themselves up.    Participation is the first step in trying to fight drowsiness in the classroom. Sitting in the front of the classroom will make students more likely to focus on the instructor and class discussions. If we are seated up front we won't let our eyes "rest" for just a second, because we all know the instructor will call us out. During dull monologues, students can stay busy by taking notes. I like to take notes in crazy fonts or use different colored pens to keep things more interesting. If the teacher gives the notes students can always pull out their highlighters and mark important text. Participating in classroom discussions is also a great way to help students wake up and make a good impression on the instructor. Participation is a productive way to stay awake during class.     If classroom participation fails to keep the student awake then more creative ways must be used. All of us have had an instructor who is insipid; we forget about actually paying attention, just trying not to snore is hard enough. Doodling is a lifesaver for those types of classes; it gives us something to concentrate on instead of thinking about catching up on sleep. Plus, doodling looks like taking notes to the teacher when in actuality we are just drawing our version of our favorite cartoon character. I have known other students who say when they get bored during class they start mentally singing their favorite song. However, be careful not to accidentally start belting out Katy Perry's latest hit in the middle of class. The instructor won't appreciate it, trust me I know. Sometimes during my eight a.m. class, I wish I could just go back to sleep and finish the dream my alarm woke me up from that morning. Students can finish their dream by daydreaming, and as an added bonus we can control what happens unlike when we are asleep. Daydreaming is a good way to keep students' minds active. However, one should be careful not to doze off during all that daydreaming. Trying to stay awake during class can be a task, but remember to try and find creative ways to keep the mind active.     The final step to staying awake during class is the use of physical stimulants. We've all had those nights of cramming for a test or partying, and dragging ourselves to class just trying to hold our eyes open. Coffee is always a good idea to wake up; caffeine is everyone's best friend in the morning. Red Bull is an alternative many college students choose to get their blood flowing and body awakened. Chewing on something can also help keep students awake. I often bring some candy to class like gummy worms, gum, or pixie sticks to snack on while the instructor is not looking. Candy helps raise blood sugar levels and energize students thus helping them not to fall asleep. Being a girl, I always have a hair tie on my wrist, whenever I feel myself getting sleepy I pop it to rouse myself. Students could also pinch themselves to wake up. I have also seen students give themselves a few light slaps in the face to keep alert; this trick can come in handy during lengthy tests. Although it may look a bit crazy it works. If students are feeling really desperate they can physically hold their eyes open to make sure they don't fall asleep. These physical stimulations should help keep students awake and alert during class.     Staying awake can be a difficult task in college, following these steps will help students stay engaged and alert. Participation is a simple step toward staying focused and awake. However, sometimes more creative measures must be taken to avoid falling asleep. When all else fails physical stimulation is the ultimate technique in staying awake. While not all students are aroused by the same methods every college student must realize the importance of staying awake during class. ---Essay by Makenzie Snipes

1. (20 points total): In preparing for a picnic (socially-distanced, of course!), the host of the event puts some old-style glass Coca-Cola bottles at 25*C into a large washtub full of ice water at 0*C. We are interested in the temperature of the Coca-Cola inside the bottles over time. The bottles remain submerged in the ice water. In generating your model, assume that the bottle is isothermal but include its ability to store energy. Also assume that the Coca-Cola inside the bottle is isothermal, but that you also need to include its ability to store energy.

When cockroaches are attacked by a toad, they turn and run away.  A roach has wind sensors that react to puffs of air pushed ahead of approaching predators.  Theses sensors are concentrated on its cerci, two thin projecting appendages at the end of its abdomen.  One cercus points slightly to the right, the other to the left.  Use what you know about moth orientation to bat cries to suggest how this simple system might provide the information the roach needs to turn and run away from the toad, rather than toward it.

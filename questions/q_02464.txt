Alpha contracted in writing to purchase 100 widgets from Beta for $1,000 each. Alpha believed Beta was having problems with its suppliers and would not be able to perform all its contract obligations (Beta sold widgets to many buyers), and Alpha wanted to be sure Beta delivered to Alpha, even if Beta ran short of widgets. Alpha therefore included a contract provision requiring Beta to pay $500,000 to Alpha if Beta failed to deliver the widgets as agreed. Widgets were generally available at market prices ranging from $1,100 to $1,200, at both the time of contracting and the time Beta was to deliver. Beta failed to deliver as agreed. Is Beta liable to Alpha for $500,000?

Instructions: Read the paragraph below and then answer the following questions by selecting the letter of the correct response.        Coffee drinkers should seriously consider switching to tea. According to the latest research, the ingredients in tea may help people stay slim. When Taiwanese researchers studied 1,000 people, they found that the people who drank two cups of any kind of tea every week for ten years had 20 percent less body fat than people who didn't drink tea. But there's an even better reason to switch. As it turns out, tea lowers the risk of serious disease, such as some cancers, heart attack, and stroke. In 2003, scientists found out that after just three weeks of drinking five cups of black tea per day, fifteen people cut their cholesterol by 7 percent and their bad LDL cholesterol by 11 percent. Australian researchers studying 218 women found that tea reduced blood pressure; in fact, the more tea a person drank, the more blood pressure dropped. Coffee does not offer any of these health benefits, so tea is clearly the better beverage choice.   This paragraph was written for an audience of

Glycolysis is not the only metabolic pathway for glucose utilization.  This problem explores the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (shown below), named for its discoverers.  The net result of the pathway is that a molecule of glucose is converted to two molecules of CO2 plus two molecules of ethanol.  2-Keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate is split into two molecules (pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) and each continues separately to yield the same final product (ethanol).  Note that the reactions from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to pyruvate are identical to those used in glycolysis.  Can glucose metabolism by the Entner-Doudoroff pathway proceed indefinitely in the absence of a functioning citric acid cycle (in other words, in the absence of oxygen)?

A 500,000 kg locomotive is traveling at 13 m/s when it begins to slow down with a constant acceleration of -2 m/s2.  a) How long will it take for the locomotive to come to a stop (so the final velocity is 0 m/s)?  b) How far will the locomotive slide before it comes to a stop (so the final velocity is 0 m/s)?  c) What is the net force on the locomotive if the acceleration is -2m/s2? d) Draw a free body (force) diagram showing the forces on the locomotive. SHOW YOUR WORK AND ANSWERS ON A SEPARATE SHEET OF PAPER AND INCLUDE IT WITH YOUR UPLOAD OF THE TEST.

Ca++-ATPases are found in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane of many cell types.  They pump Ca++ (calcium ions) against the concentration gradient and require ATP for function.   This is an example of [1] Macrophages are a type of specialized white blood cell that non-selectively ingest entire prokaryotic cells.  This is an example of [2] Glut5 transports the disaccharide fructose down its concentration gradient across the plasma membranes of cells lining the small intestine. Glut5 only transports fructose and changes shape during the transport process.  The movement of glucose can best be described as [3]

Given the following graph  i) Perform the liveness analysis and write down the IN and OUT sets for each basic block  For Empty In/Out's please type none, all answers should be comma separated, lower case, with no spaces between in alphabetical order. (EG: a,b,c NOT B, c,a) IN{B1} = [B1In], OUT{B1} = [B1Out] IN{B2} = [B2In], OUT{B2} = [B2Out] IN{B3} = [B3In], OUT{B3} = [B3Out] IN{B4} = [B4In], OUT{B4} = [B4Out] IN{B5} = [B5In], OUT{B5} = [B5Out] IN{B6} = [B6In], OUT{B6} = {}   (ii) Find out webs for each variable. Write your solution in the following format: for example, 1,2,3 forms a web for x in the above example where 1, 2, and 3 are the corresponding instructions, W = list all the instructions in the corresponding d-u and u-d chains corresponding to that web in comma separated format in ascending order with no spaces between. W(x) = [wx1] W(x) = [wx2] W(y) = [wy1] W(y) = [wy2] W(z) = [wz1]
Mahoney Moving and Storage makes plastic storage boxes. Each box either passes or fails inspection.  These boxes are independent and each has a probability of failing inspection equal to 0.064.  This copywritten question is part of a quiz or exam at Arizona State.  It may not be posted or reproduced without the permission of the author, Dr. L. Chattin, and Arizona State University. Fifty-five of these boxes are tested.  What is the probability that fewer than seven of the boxes fail inspection?  Enter your answer to four decimal places.

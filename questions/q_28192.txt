You are viewing a slide of nervous tissue. In the slide, you see 4 distinct regions: Region A contains cells that have chromosomes aligned at the center of the cell. Region B contains cells with chromatids attached to spindle fibers and migrating towards opposite poles of the cell. Region C has cells with no nuclear envelope and centrioles starting to migrate towards opposite poles of the cell. Region D has cells with cleavage furrows present. Which of the following stages of the cell cycle are you seeing in: (Learning Objective 23, page 11) Region A? Region B? Region C? Region D?

A driver traveling down a 4% grade collides with a roadside object in rainy conditions. The accident investigation team determined the following: The vehicle was traveling 40 mph when it struck the object, braking skid marks started 200 ft before struck object, the pavement is in good condition (assume the coefficient of road adhesion of 0.6), and the braking efficiency of the vehicle was 0.95. Using the theoretical stopping distance, assuming negligible aerodynamic resistance and the coefficient of rolling distance of 0.015, determine the initial speed of the driver/vehicle (in ft/s)?

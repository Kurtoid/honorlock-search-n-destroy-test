True/False.  Enter T or F for statement.  (Do not enter the words "true" or "false".  Just the letter T or F) [1] Maxwell's equations represent 6 equations and 6 unknowns. [2] Transmission line effects can be ignored when the signal frequency is below 1 MHz. [3] The voltage/current waves propagating inside a transmission line are derived from "wave equations". [4] A "lossless" transmission line ignores  capacitance/inductance effects. [5] An antenna creates waves by wiggling electric charge in order to disturb/perturb the electromagnetic field. [6] The Poynting vector points in the direction of propagation. [7] Radio waves transmit both information and energy from point A to point B. [8] For best power efficiency, a half-wave dipole antenna should have 1/2 the impedance of the transmission line that feeds it. [9] VHF stands for "very high frequency". [10] Part 15 of the FCC regulations primarily discuss the allocation of spectrum to cell phone providers.

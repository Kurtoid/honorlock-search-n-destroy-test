Alejandro bought the house, but the following month he attempted to rescind the contract because Helen had not explicitly pointed out these cosmetic problems. What will the likely outcome be?
D189 at the bottom of the substrate specificity pocket of trypsin interacts with K and R side chains of the substrate, and this contributes to the preferred cleavage sites of trypsin. A student suggests engineering a D189K variant of trypsin, predicting that such a variant would exhibit specificity towards D and E containing peptides or proteins. What would be your advice be to this student about their proposed experiment?

Problem 2 Counters count clock cycles Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner.  The tool bar has indent functions.  This is a generic counter design, of course there are other ways to make a counter (may require some modification for this problem). Make a counter module that counts from 0 up to MaxVal and then goes back to 0 and continues to count. You will need clk, reset inputs, and outputs the current count, and carry which is True when count == MaxVal. Use a parameter Size to set the size of array count and the output of the MUX. Use a default parameter Size of 3. Use System Verilog, always_ff, and always_comb, and don't use reg datatype. (hint: see cheat sheet) A) First write a 2:1 multiplexer module (use parameter Size to set the width of inputs A, B, and output F. B) Write a D flipflop register (REG in the figure above) to hold the current count. Use parameter Size to set the width of D, and Q, and Q'. C) Write a module instantiating the multiplexer, and register with additional components/logic necessary to count 0-MaxVal and then go back to 0 and continue counting back to MaxVal ... and so on. Use parameter Size to set the width of Count, and MaxVal. Don't forget the carry output.

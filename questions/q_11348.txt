Imagine that some members of an aquatic species of motile, photosynthetic protists evolve to become parasitic to fish. They gain the ability to live in the fish gut, absorbing nutrients as the fish digests food. Over time, which of the following phenotypic changes would you expect to observe in this population of protists?

Which of the following diatomic elements would have a mass of 19.08 grams stored in a 3.82 L container at 3,632 mm Hg and 100degC?
Umbrella Corp. is planning to pay a $1.75 per share dividend next year, followed by a liquidating dividend of $82 the following year when they cease operations. You currently own 500 shares and would prefer to receive the same cash flow each of the next two years, instead. As such, you plan to homemake a dividend of $38.4777 per share for each of the next two years, instead. How many shares of stock will you need to sell after you receive the first dividend if the cost of equity of the stock is 18.5 percent? (Round your answer to the nearest share)

Please read the following description of a pathological condition.  Secondary to prolonged sitting resulting from bad posture habits, the spinal ligaments in a lumbar segment become overstretched. As a result the Type I and Type II receptors located in the joint capsule are disrupted and destroyed. Reduced afferent impulses from type I receptors decrease tonic reflexogenic activity in the muscles. The transverso-spinal muscles, which are 70% tonic, show decreased activity. This reduces the spine's ability to provide segmental stabilization. Segmental motion now occurs around a non-physiological axis due to inhibition of the muscles that guide motion and to a destabilization incurred by Ligamentous laxity. Coupled movement of the spine, which requires precise vertebral movement around physiologic axes, is now in jeopardy. Under these conditions, the facet joint's ligaments, capsule, fascia, and muscles are exposed to trauma during movement. These now hypermobile joints are predisposed to locking by tissue becoming entrapped within a facet joint. Due to trauma, type IV receptors are activated leading to tonic reflexogenic guarding. A sequence of physiologic events is initiated in response to trauma, which leads to immobility and the production of scar tissue. An initially hypermobile joint is now hypomobile. Articulation or manipulation, using type I and type II mechanoreceptors, inhibits pain and guarding while resolving the locking. Mobilization might also combine contraction of the multifidus muscle. By gapping the facet joint and contracting the multifidus muscle, the entrapped material is pulled from within the facet joint. The now mobile joint must be stabilized through and appropriate exercise program. Pain is resolved with the manual techniques while the joint is still hypermobile and unstable. It requires stabilizing exercises to prevent future locking.  What pathological condition is described above?

Predisposed to Re-Offend? The New York State legislature passed a law that permits the state to lock up individuals for crimes they might commit, rather than for crimes they have already committed. The law requires mental health professionals to screen all prison inmates doing time for sex offenses and determine if they are disposed to committing more sex crimes upon release. Those found likely to re-offend would be placed on trial, and if a jury agrees they are dangerous, they would be confined or placed under very strict supervision in the community.42 This law is a departure from traditional criminal procedure, which requires a crime to be committed before a person can be held legally responsible and punished. It also assumes as fact the controversial proposition that mental health professionals can accurately predict future dangerousness of offenders. Nevertheless, the law responds to public fears regarding potential repeat crimes by sex offenders.  Should we punish offenders for future crimes that they are found to be at high risk of committing?  8-5   An Affair, a Trial, and an Execution   A death sentence was delayed, when the offender claimed his murder trial was impacted by an ongoing love affair between the judge and the prosecutor in the case. The convicted murderer, Charles Hood, age 39, robbed and murdered a couple he lived with in Texas. He was linked to the crime by fingerprints, and was arrested the next day while driving a car belonging to the murdered man--Hood's supervisor at a strip club where they both worked. Lawyers contended that the affair was long-rumored in legal circles, but no evidence about it existed. This changed when a former prosecutor said that the romantic relationship "was common knowledge" at the time of the trial. With this testimony, Mr. Hood's lawyers asked the court to stay the execution.43  What is the judge and prosecutor having a romantic affair while working the same case, have to do with the outcome of the case.

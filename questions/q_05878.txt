Select "uses the source appropriately" if the sentence uses and acknowledges the source appropriately.Original source:Radio was a new thrill for many Americans in the twenties, but it had extraordinary value for the isolated farm families of the Midwest, for whom solitude loomed as a daily problem. Radio was a source of music and fun, information and weather reports, and it was an easy way to enjoy the pleasure of other people's company. In-person visiting was a special event that often meant putting on dress clothes and serving cakes and lemonade and gathering politely in the parlor; frequently the press of chores or bad weather made that impossible. But with a radio, women could continue their housework as they listened to a friendly voice; men working in the barn had access to weather reports and farm programs. From:Stern, Jane, and Michael Stern. Two for the Road: Our Love Affair with American Food. Houghton Mifflin, 2005. The passage appears on page 103.Using the source:According to Stern and Stern, the radio offered busy farm families companionship that was easier than traditional socializing, which could be difficult or time-consuming to organize (103).

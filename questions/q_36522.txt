Consider the following PORTION of an explanation of "why do the study" and "what is/are the research question(s)" to be addressed:   1)There is a question among policy-makers about the degree to which economies of scale exist in the provision of education (K-12).  2)No doubt in my mind that increased school district size means decreased cost per pupil (i.e., economies of scale) without any sacrifice in academic performance.  3)If one can demonstrate substantial economies of scale (without adverse effects on academic performance), then consideration should then be given to consolidating small school districts or merging them into larger districts.   4)In my project, I will definitely show that small school districts in Texas (among the 1000 districts in total that exist in the State) are a waste of money.  Which of the previous sentences strongly need to be rephrased to be appropriate for a research proposal?

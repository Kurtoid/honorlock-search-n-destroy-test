A random sample of observed groundwater concentration of sulfate in milligrams per liter (mg/l) at a location is provided below: 114.5   113.0   51.5   102.0   145.0   87.0   111.0   111.0   104.0    151.0 a) Compute the sample coefficient of variation. Using the empirical CDF of the sample, compute: b) The sample median. c) The probability that that sulfate concentration at this location exceeds 104 mg/l. d) The 85% quantile of the data. Note: Use the lowest rank to adjust the estimated eCDF values for repeated observations.

9) A contractor plans on supporting a high rise building in West Palm Beach Florida on 18" diameter auger cast piles installed in the Anastasia Limestone Formation. Six individual borings where performed on the site.  The mean cohesion, c [ cohesion = unit skin friction =  1/2  sqrt (qu) sqrt (t)] in each boring was 12 tsf, 9 tsf, 8 tsf, 6 tsf, 8tsf and 6 tsf (note recoveries are 0.8).   The mean cohesion, c (fs,B) , for all the rock specimens at the site is 8.2 tsf, with a standard deviation of 4.5 tsf.  The estimated unit skin friction from the mean boring data and load testing on the site is given as, fs,bias corrected (tsf)  = 0.2+0.95 fs,B with method error

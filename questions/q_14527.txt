You are interested in studying a gene called pumper that is important for heart function. The pumper gene is only expressed (transcribed) in heart cells, and you think the reason for this may have to do with chromatin structure. To investigate this, you isolate chromatin from heart cells and skin cells, and perform a long digestion of both samples with DNAse I, a non-sequence specific enzyme that will cut the phosphodiester bonds linking adjacent nucleotides. You then remove all proteins and analyze the DNA by gel-electrophoresis. You are able to detect only the DNA fragments that contain the pumper gene. The bands at the top of lane 2 indicate very large DNA fragments that were not able to migrate very far in the gel. The numbers to the left indicate where in the gel DNA fragments of the indicated size would migrate. Based on this data, which of the following is likely to be TRUE regarding the pumper locus in heart cells? (select all that apply)

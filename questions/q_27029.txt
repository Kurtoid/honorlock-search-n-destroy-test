Barbara decided to apply for a summer job. The job was to help mow the grass and weed the flower beds at the local park. A portion of the application required Barbara to write a paragraph about why she would be the best candidate for the job. Read her response below. Then answer the following question(s).      1While other students my age are applying for this position, I feel I am the best qualified for the job. 2My father or mother work in the yard each weekend. 3My parents taught me all about yard work. 4When only eight years old, my father taught me how to mow the grass. 5I have been mowing the lawn for almost half of my life. 6He taught me to overlap the rows that I cut so I won't have any uneven places in the grass. 7He also made sure I knew how to be safe with the lawnmower. 8I never wear shorts, and always have a good pair of shoes on. 9I also know that it is safest to wear safety goggles while mowing. 10He taught me to never leave a running mower unattended or mow when other people or pets are close by. 11My mother taught me the difference between weeds and garden flowers when she taught me to weed our garden. 12My parents have made I the best candidate for the job by teaching me the right way to mow and weed.       During editing, Barbara notices that a pronoun in sentence 12 may be used incorrectly. She knows that the pronouns me and I can be tricky. Should Barbara change one of the pronouns? Why? How should the sentence be written?
Which of the following organisms is responsible for most cases of bacterial pneumonia?
Read the following scenario to answer the following question(s).Biomedical scientists have recently developed an anticancer drug delivery system that sneaks the anticancer drug into cancer cells before releasing it. They were able to do this by using two sets of liposomes. An anticancer drug (Doxorubicin (Dox)) bound to DNA molecules was added into one set of liposomes (type A), and a high concentration of ATP molecules were added to the other set of liposomes (type B). The drug is inactive when bound to DNA molecules. Researchers inject both types of liposomes (A and B) into cancer cells, and upon doing so their contents are released. The ATP molecules (from liposome type A) bind to the DNA molecules (from liposome type B) and activate the drug, thus inducing cell death and decreasing tumor size.Mice with breast cancer tumors were treated with this liposome system to test the effectiveness of the drug. The scientists performed three trials one with both types of liposomes (Dox + ATP), one with just the drug (Dox only), and one with a salt solution (control). Examine the figure below and answer the following questions.What would be the best experiment to test the effectiveness of this anticancer drug system?

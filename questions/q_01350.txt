In this course we covered multiple ways of representing Simple Graphs. A simple graph does not have a self loop or a parallel edge. One example of a graph that is not simple is:  Two of the methods we covered for representing simple graphs were Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix. Pick one of these ways of representation and extend the representation to support a graph that is weighted and has parallel edges and self-loops. 1. Describe a data structure you will use to store such a graph in C++. [2.5 points] 2. Write the following methods in C++ that performs the respective functions on the data structure you described in (1) [7.5 points].   void insertEdge (int from, int to, int weight) - inserts an edge in your data structure  bool isEdge(int from, int to, int weight) - checks if an edge exists in your data structure with a given weight vector getWeights(int from, int to); - returns a vector of all weights that correspond to the edges between from and to vertices.

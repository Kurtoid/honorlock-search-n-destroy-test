Questions 18-26 refer to the following passage from a longer article.     Title of Article: "Too Many Colleges Are Still in Denial about Alcohol Abuse"   Authors: Henry Wechsler, Charles Deutsch, and George Dowdall     Title of Periodical: Chronicle of Higher Education   Volume/Issue: Volume 41, Issue 31     Date of Publication: April 14, 1995   Page numbers: Bl- B2     Database: Academic Search Complete   Access Date: August 17, 2013     URL: http://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/ioanna.panos/engl1301-165- 166/unit-3b-binge-drinking-college/too-many-colleges-are-still-in- denial-about-alcohol-abuse-wechsler-et-al/view             Colleges have a serious problem with alcohol abuse among students, and it's not getting any better. Binge drinking - defined as the heavy, episodic use of alcohol - has persisted on campuses despite both a general decrease in alcohol consumption among Americans and an increase in the number of abstainers. Some people (including the author of a recent front-page article in the New York Times) have assumed that the latter two trends have translated into more moderate drinking on the campuses. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our recent research, which received support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was the only largescale study to date of the extent and consequences of binge drinking at a representative sample of American colleges and universities. Our detailed findings from surveys of 17,592 students at 140 randomly selected four-year colleges were published in the December 7, 1994, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association . . . Our study found that 44 percent of all students in the sample were binge drinkers - 50 percent of the men and 39 percent of the women. Which of the following statements best summarizes the main idea of this passage?
Use of statistical techniques to combine and summarize the results of multiple studies is considered a ____.

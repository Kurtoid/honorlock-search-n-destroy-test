Read the scenario below and answer questions 1-6   Scenario: John wished to investigate how fertilizer run-off affects the growth of algae in freshwater lakes and streams. He set his experiment up in this way. He placed 900 ml of water into each of five 1000 ml glass beakers. To each beaker, he added 5 ml of water from an aquarium which contained a large concentration of algae.

Liquid fertilizer was added to the beakers in the following amounts: Beaker A - 8 ml fertilizer, Beaker B - 6 ml fertilizer, Beaker C - 4 ml fertilizer, Beaker D - 2 ml fertilizer, and Beaker E - no fertilizer. Each week a fixed volume of the sample from each of the beakers was examined under a microscope to get a count of the number of algal cells present. The number of algal cells after week 1 were counted and the data is as follows: beaker A: 50 algal cells, Beaker B: 200 algal cells, Beaker C: 450 algal cells, Beaker D: 600 algal cells, and Beaker E: 800 algal cells.  1) What question is the experimenter trying to answer?  2) Propose a hypothesis for this experiment. 3) What is the independent variable in this experiment?  4) What is the dependent variable in this experiment?  5) List at least two variables that should be kept constant or controlled in this experiment. 6) Which beaker would serve as the control group for this experiment?

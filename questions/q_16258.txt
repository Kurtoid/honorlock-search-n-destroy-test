You are a safety manager of a road construction site. Recently, lots of casualties were reported from the site, so you are asked to identify the cause and implement the best safety measure to minimize accidents in the jobsite. After inspection, you found that the most critical cause is an intrusion accident caused by cars passing by the jobsite. In that situation, you need to decide the best safety measure among the 3 options as follows.  Option 1: Hiring additional traffic controllers Option 2: Changing working hours to the night Option 3: Deploying the new technology that provides intrusion warning  You can only take one option among the three options considering effectiveness, cost, and sustainability.  Assume that pairwise comparison is derived from interviews with experts.         Which factor is more favorable over another?   How much the selected factor is favorable over another?

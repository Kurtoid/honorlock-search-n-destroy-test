The following study vignette relates to questions 33-34. A social work researcher, Graciela Ortiz, with a strong interest in ecology and environmental justice hypothesizes a connection between access to community green spaces and time spent outdoors on the one hand, and symptoms of stress and depression among urban dwellers on the other hand.  Examining data from a crossectional  large-scale population study, Dr. Ortiz discovers a significant inverse relationship between symptoms of stress/depression and access to and use of green spaces. Encouraged by this finding, Dr. Ortiz develops a study to test out a program consisting of outdoors/nature activities (Natural Me Program) for adults in a low-income, diverse community in Milwaukee who screen as having mild or moderate depressive symptoms. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Which of the following describes the process when researchers build on their more preliminary research findings to develop and test more rigorous (e.g. explanatory) hypotheses?

Marbury v. Madison Directions: You will read through the excerpt on this Landmark Supreme Court Case. After you will answer questions based on the excerpt.    Facts about the case: Thomas Jefferson defeated John Adams in the 1800 presidential election. Before Jefferson took office on March 4, 1801, Adams and Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1801, which created new courts, added judges, and gave the president more control over appointment of judges. The Act was essentially an attempt by Adams and his party to frustrate his successor, as he used the act to appoint 16 new circuit judges and 42 new justices of the peace. The appointees were approved by the Senate, but they would not be valid until their commissions were delivered by the Secretary of State.  William Marbury had been appointed Justice of the Peace in the District of Columbia, but his commission was not delivered. Marbury petitioned the Supreme Court to compel the new Secretary of State, James Madison, to deliver the documents. Marbury, joined by three other similarly situated appointees, petitioned for a writ of mandamus compelling the delivery of the commissions.  Conclusion: The Court found that Madison's refusal to deliver the commission was illegal, but did not order Madison to hand over Marbury's commission via writ of mandamus. Instead, the Court held that the provision of the Judiciary Act of 1789 enabling Marbury to bring his claim to the Supreme Court was itself unconstitutional, since it purported to extend the Court's original jurisdiction beyond that which Article III, Section 2, established.  Marshall expanded that a writ of mandamus was the proper way to seek a remedy, but concluded the Court could not issue it. Marshall reasoned that the Judiciary Act of 1789 conflicted with the Constitution. Congress did not have power to modify the Constitution through regular legislation because the Supremacy Clause places the Constitution before the laws.  In so holding, Marshall established the principle of judicial review, i.e., the power to declare a law unconstitutional.    What is the general premise of this case? i.e what was the case about.

EH Books is a publisher of books that does all of its own book production - from text edit to printing and binding the books. EH is planning to create a new glossy book to commemorate the upcoming 100th anniversary of the founding of the BBC (the British Broadcasting Corporation). The publishing project will last 4 years after which EH expects the demand for this book to have been exhausted and the project completed. The printing of this book will require a different printing process than EH's other books. As a result, EH would need to purchase printing machinery and equipment for $1,250,000. Installation for the equipment will cost an additional $75,000. EH will use straight line depreciation for this project. EH has already paid for some preliminary design work for the book. This design work cost $25,250. EH expects the following sales figures:     Year   Units Sold     1   20,000     2   15,000     3   10,000     4   5,000       The sales price of the book would be $75. Variable costs for the book will be $25. There will be additional annual fixed costs of $11,500. The book project will require an initial injection of net working capital of $7,500 which will be returned at the end of the project. EH's corporate tax rate is 34% and EH has decided that the appropriate discount rate for this project is 15%.  Determine the free cash flows of the project for time 0 to time 4. Calculate the NPV and IRR for this project. Should EH undertake the publishing of this book?

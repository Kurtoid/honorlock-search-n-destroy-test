The stimulant pseudoephedrine is used as a nasal decongestant. Its salts are used in many over-the-counter drugs, often in combination with additional active ingredients such as antihistamines. Consider the structure of N-protonated pseudoephedrine (shown below) and answer the following questions.  The lowest-energy conformation of N-protonated pseudoephedrine is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and the ammonium group. Which of the following Newman projections (A-F) represents this conformation viewed through the C1-C2 bond? [conformation]  Recall that dihedral angles are measured clockwise when answering the next two questions. Consider the conformation of N-protonated pseudoephedrine in which the hydroxyl group and the ammonium group are eclipsed. What is the dihedral angle between phenyl (Ph) substituent and ammonium group in this conformation? [dihedral1] What is the dihedral angle between the phenyl (Ph) substituent and the ammonium group in Newman structure F? [dihedral2] Do Newman structures D and F represent conformational isomers? [isomers]

Essay Prompt 1: Lynching - Dutchman and Get Out  In class, we discussed several ways both Clay in Dutchman and Chris in Get Out symbolize the epidemic of the lynching of Black men. Choose one of the following thesis statements, depending on which film(s) you wish you engage for this prompt:  Thesis choice 1: Dutchman and Get Out both function as lynching narratives; however, Chris survives and Clay does not because ____________.    Thesis choice 2: Dutchman functions as a lynching narrative, in which Clay's death is a reminder of the violence visited on the bodies of Black men a hundred years before the play's conception.  Thesis choice 3: Get Out functions as a lynching narrative, in which Chris' escape from death serves a reminder of the violence visited on the bodies of Black men in the past and a hope for future change.  Use the elements about lynching that we discussed in class and are featured in the PPT on this subject. Hint: The elements will be your essay's POPs.If you are going to deal with one film only, aim to discuss 3 - 5 elements.If you plan to use both films, aim to compare/contrast 2 - 3 elements for both films.  Essay Prompt 2: Career Woman in Peril - Laura and Foul Play In class, we discussed how Soare's essay introduces a new film genre, The Career Woman in Peril thriller (CPT), featuring the Career Woman in Peril (CWP) heroine. The CWPT genre was influenced heavily by a past film genre, the Gothic Women's Film (GWF), featuring the Gothic Woman (GW) heroine.  Soare argues that the differences between the CWP heroine and the GW heroine result in the CWP heroine being a feminist heroine and the GW heroine being an anti-feminist heroine. Laura from Laura (1944), and Gloria from Foul Play (1978) fit the CWP figure in that they are single, whereas the GW is always married; however, beyond this difference, the ability to define either Laura or Gloria as a CWP (feminist) heroine or a GW (anti-feminist) heroine is up for debate. Choose one of the following thesis statements depending on which film(s) and idea you wish to engage for this prompt:   Thesis choice 1: Laura of Laura is a feminist heroine because she fits the conventions of the CWPT heroine.  Thesis choice 2: Laura of Laura is an anti-feminist heroine because she fits the conventions of the GWF heroine.  Thesis choice 3: Gloria of Foul Play is a feminist heroine because she fits the conventions of a CWPT heroine. Thesis choice 4: Gloria of Foul Play is an anti-feminist heroine because she fits the conventions of a GWF heroine. Thesis choice 5: Laura of Laura and Gloria of Foul Play are feminist heroines because they fit the conventions of a CWPT heroine. Thesis choice 6: Laura of Laura and Gloria of Foul Play are anti-feminist heroines because they fit the conventions of a GWF heroine. Use Soare's elements that we discussed in class and are featured in the PPT on this subject. Hint: The elements will be your essay's POPs. If you are going to deal with one film only, aim to discuss 3 - 5 elements.If you plan to use both films, aim to compare/contrast the same 2  or 3 elements for both films.   Essay Prompt 3: The Lethal Femme Fatale - Double Indemnity, Body Heat, and Gone Girl Jack Boozer's essay, "The Lethal Femme Fatale," traces the history of the femme fatale through three eras: Classic, Neo, and Post Noir. For this prompt, write an essay in which your thesis will be to prove that a character meets Boozer's definition for either the classic femme fatale or the post-noir femme fatale.  CAVEAT: We have studied Janey Place's reading of the femme fatale. Be sure that you use Boozer's elements and not Place's in your response. Choose one of these possible thesis statements:     Thesis choice 1: Phyllis of Double Indemnity fits Boozer's definition of the classic femme fatale.  Thesis choice 2: Matty of Body Heat fits Boozer's definition of the post-noir femme fatale. Thesis choice 3: Amy of Gone Girl fits Boozer's definition of the post-noir femme fatale Thesis choice 4: Matty of Body Heat and Amy of Gone Girl fit Boozer's definition of the post-noir femme fatale.    Use Boozer's elements that we discussed in class and are featured in the PPT on this subject. Hint: The elements will be your essay's POPs.  If you are going to deal with one film only, aim to discuss 3 - 5 elements.If you plan to use two films, (Choice 4), aim to compare/contrast the same 2 and 3 elements for both films.  Regardless of which thesis you choose, end your essay (your closing strategy) by discussing the major problem with Boozer's theory - he leaves out an important aspect in his analysis; a shortcoming I mentioned several times in class.

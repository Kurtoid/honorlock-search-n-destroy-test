An engineer was performing analysis to determine the Manning's roughness coefficient (n) values for stream channels in a mixed land-use watershed. The engineer classified the stream reach sections into 3 categories: (i) smooth channel sections, (ii) stony bed with few weeds on banks, and (iii) very weedy, winding sections. The engineer encountered a labeling error while recording the information.  The following three n values were in his notebook - 0.15, 0.05, 0.025 - but without proper labeling the engineer was unable the assign the n values to proper stream reach sections.  Based on your knowledge of open-channel flow and Manning's roughness coefficient, match the three "n" values against the appropriate stream reach section categories and provide a brief supporting explanation. (i) smooth channel sections: (ii) stony bed with few weeds on the banks: (iii) very weedy, winding sections:

For this second half of the exam you will see output from SPSS and will need to use the output to answer each question. The output and questions come from a survey given to restaurant customers. These customers were asked standard demographic questions such as age, gender, marital status, number of family members, income, level of education and so on. They were also asked questions related to if they prefer simple decor in restaurants, listen to the radio, and other questions the restaurant manager felt might be useful. You will see output from SPSS for these variables. You will be provided with the output you need to answer each question. There will likely also be additional results/output that you may not need. It is up to you to understand which output you need to report and interpret to answer each question. Simply repeating/reporting all of the given output will be counted as incorrect.   Be sure and report/interpret only the correct analyses and information. For instance, if the question requires a T-test and you report a correlation (or the T-test and a correlation)- it will be incorrect. Again, report only the appropriate test/ results.

OPTIONAL BONUS (Up to 5 points!): Write a random maxim. (It must have the standard form of a maxim but otherwise it can say anything you want.) Then apply the categorical imperative to it.

For the rest of this exam, use the following application architecture description as the basis to answer the below questions: Overview - The application is called "CCAPP".  It has a web-based front-end interface and exposes several services for other applications to utilize. Web Infrastructure -  All the application components are written in .NET and deployed on 2 app pools on 3 IIS servers named WIIS1.acme.com (with IP 10.20.10.101), acme.com (with IP 10.20.10.102), & WIIS3.acme.com (with IP 10.20.10.103) - they each listen on port 80. One app pool is for the web-based user interface and utilizes the "/ccapp" virtual directory, while the other app pool is for the web services and uses the "/ccapp-apis" virtual directory The IIS servers are part of two pools (one for each virtual directory) front-ended by a load balancer. The load balancer exposes two VIPs (ccapp.acme.com with IP 204.153.78.20 for the user interface and ccapp-apis.acme.com with IP 204.153.78.21 for the web services) to the internet. The load balancer proxies the web servers and populates the X-Forwarded-For HTTP Header for both pools Both app pools are recycled in a rolling fashion (one IIS server at a time) each night There is no "session stickiness" because the session state is stored in a database  Security & Network  There is a firewall in between the load balancer and the IIS servers The application's front-end interface is protected by an OAUTH cloud-based service that has a replicated copied of the company's Active Directory. For any user to authenticate to the application it needs to be defined in AD and part of the ccapp-users group. The application's web services are protected by IP-filtering (only certain IP addresses are allowed to connect to them) and application tokens (long strings) are individually shared with each client There is a firewall in between the IIS servers and the database server  Database & Other external factors  CCAPP utilizes a SQL Server database (IP 10.20.20.100) for its application data and its session state (only applicable to the user interface) CCAPP (UI & services) makes calls to internal web services that have their own web and database servers. The application also makes calls to web services on the Internet The application is 24x7, but also has a nightly batch job component that performs heavy updates for a couple of hours Transaction log backups occur every 30 minutes, differential backups nightly and full backups weekly on Sundays Index rebuilds and/or reorgs (depending on the state of each index) as well statistics updates are performed on a weekly basis as well The database is large (over 3TB) and replicated to another location asynchronously for disaster recovery purposes  Personnel  Assume you have access to a business user representative, an ITSM practitioner, server engineer, DBA, web hosting engineer, network engineer & an application developer  The following are the answers provided to the above:  Ask the ITSM practitioner if any relevant changes were performed recently - no relevant changes found in last two days  Ask the business user representative to acquire the IP address of one of the users with a problem - An internal user's IP address is 10.10.9.2  Ask the business user representative to acquire the IP address of the external partner experiencing the problem - The IP address of the external partner is 153.23.24.11  Ask the Web Hosting engineer to look for errors in the IIS server logs - 500 errors only seem to appear on WIIS2.acme.com and they seem to be occurring often  Ask the Server engineer if any of the IIS servers or the database server is experiencing high activity - No servers are experiencing high activity  Ask the Database administrator to see if there are any blocked sessions - No blocked sessions found  Ask the Database administrator to look at whether there are any errors in the database logs or out of space conditions - No errors in the database logs or out of space conditions on the DB server  Ask the Network engineer to see if the firewall is experiencing high CPU - CPU activity is normal on the firewall     Based on the above answers, select the three most appropriate follow-up questions/actions. - 10 points

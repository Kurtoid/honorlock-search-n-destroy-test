(Treat all values given as having 3 significant figures.)  Boxes m1 = 8 kg and m2 = 4 kg are compressed against identical springs, each with spring constant k = 4000 N/m.  Each spring is compressed by x = 0.40 m by its mass.  The masses are released from rest.  When they come free of the springs, m1 is traveling to the right and m2 is traveling to the left on a frictionless level surface.  They collide and stick together.  What is the velocity of the masses (now stuck together) after the collision?  Take +x direction be to the right.

Emmy Tater wants to train her Arabian, Goinferever, to compete in 100-mile endurance rides. Emmy rides Goinferever on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays for 30 minutes per day. Each riding session consists of walking (5 minutes), trotting (10 minutes), cantering (10 minutes), and walking (5 minutes), for a total of 5 miles per day.

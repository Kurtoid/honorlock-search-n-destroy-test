Your boss at Boeing asks you to make an Al alloy as strong as possible.  (a) (10 pts) Design a complete process to get the strongest Al-4% Cu alloy. In your design, you need to consider (a) grain boundary strengthening; (b) precipitation hardening; (c) strain hardening.  The reference phase diagram and aging plots are given. Can this material be used at 545 0C? Why?      (b) (10 pts) You got suggestion from a friend that you can try eutectic Al-Cu alloy (33 wt% Cu). (b-1) Estimate the weight fractions of intermetallic th phase at equilibrium in the Al-4% Cu alloy and eutectic Al-Cu alloys.  (b-2) How can you make an eutectic Al-Cu alloy stronger than the heat-treated Al-4% Cu alloy that you got in the first question? What microstructure do you expect?   (c) (10 pts) Instead of getting the Al-4%Cu alloy in part (a), you make an oxide dispersion Al alloy by mixing pure Al and Al2O3 via powder metallurgy. Does the oxide dispersion strengthening mechanism work if you use this material at 600 0C? Why?

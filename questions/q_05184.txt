A scientist wanted to map the relative positions of three linked genes on chromosome 3 of the fruit fly Drosophila. These genes are called Stubble, Lyra, and scarlet. Each gene has two alleles, one dominant and one recessive. The scientist did a cross between females that were heterozygous for all three genes and males that were homozygous recessive for all three genes. The following results were obtained from the cross:  826 offspring had nonrecombinant phenotypes. 168 offspring had recombinant phenotypes involving Lyra and Stubble. 134 offspring had recombinant phenotypes involving Stubble and scarlet.  34 offspring had recombinant phenotypes involving scarlet and Lyra.   Which two genes are closest together on chromosome 3?

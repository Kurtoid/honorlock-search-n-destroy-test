Consider the quadratic expression:    . Alex and Jade factored the expression differently and decided to check their answers to determine who factored correctly. See their work in the table below. Both Alex and Jade believe that their check process confirmed their respective answers.  Whose answer is correct? [who1] What was the error in the check process for the person who factored incorrectly? [why1]     Factor:    ALEX JADE   Answer: Cannot be factored Answer:        Alex reasoned that the only possible solution is , which can be written . Assuming  is the solution, Alex checked and ended with a different trinomial than the original problem. Check: Line 1     Line 2    Line 3      Line 4         Check: Line 1     Line 2     Line 3     Line 4

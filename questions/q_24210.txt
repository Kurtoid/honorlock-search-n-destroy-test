Isle Royale National Park, the largest island in Lake Superior, provides biologists with a fairly unique system for studying the interactions between different trophic levels. Isle Royale has a rather simple food chain consisting of producers and a single large herbivore that in turn has only a single predator, the gray wolf (Canis lupus). The island had a rather large abundance of balsam fir (Abies balsamea) until the park was colonized by moose (Alces alces) that swam to the island in the early 1900s.

Please use the following information to answer the question(s) below.The most recently discovered phylum in the animal kingdom (1995) is the phylum Cycliophora. It includes three species of tiny organisms that live in large numbers on the outsides of the mouthparts and appendages of lobsters. When in the feeding stage, a cycliophoran permanently attaches to the lobster via an adhesive disk and collects scraps of food from its host's feeding by capturing the scraps in a current created by a ring of cilia.

Cycliophorans are eucoelomate (have a body cavity that is a coelom) and do not molt (though their host does).Which of these features is least useful in assigning the phylum Cycliophora to a clade of animals?

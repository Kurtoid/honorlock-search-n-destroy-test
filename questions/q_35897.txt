Assume a closed economy is described by: C = 1,000 + (4/5)*(Y - T) I = 2,000 - 60,000*r Gbar = 5,000 Tbar = 3,750 Mbar = 100,000 L(Y,r) = Y - 200,000*r   a) Use the information above to derive the IS and LM equations and use these to derive the aggregate demand curve. If the long-run level of output Ybar = 16,000, calculate the resulting price level (P) and the real interest rate (r) in the long-run. b) Starting from the initial long-run equilibrium found in (a), describe how a favorable LM shock (maybe due to a decrease in the demand for real money balances) affects output (Y), the real interest rate (r), investment (I), and the price level (P) in the short-run. Describe what happens to these variables as the economy transitions to a new long-run equilibrium in the absence of any monetary or fiscal policy.

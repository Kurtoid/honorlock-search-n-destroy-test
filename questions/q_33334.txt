Exemplary Middle School   -  Read the following paragraphs describing a school for young adolescents. You will need to distinguish between those characteristics that are considered to meet the middle school philosophy and those that would characterize the school more as a junior high school.  Questions follow the reading. MSU Middle School serves young adolescents between 11 and 14 years of age.  The students are assigned to interdisciplinary teaching teams. Teachers are located near their content area peers. Students are assigned to a homeroom within that team where students read silently except when papers are passed out to students to be taken home to parents for review. The students progress through their day attending 4 classes in a block schedule that includes core academic subjects, as well as electives. The school also provides a wide array of lunch time and after school clubs.  The school leadership team, consisting of the principal, assistant principals and a variety of teacher leaders has recently implemented a transition program to ease the middle school students into the high school.   THIS IS A 3 PART QUESTION. MAKE SURE TO IDENTIFY EACH PART. DON'T MAKE IT ONE BIG PARAGRAPH.  1. Based on what you read above about MSU Middle School. Explain if you think the school is more of a middle school or more of a junior high.  2.  Explain why you identified the school as more of a middle school or a junior high - give at least 2 examples (make sure to be specific and use the text from above). The examples should demonstrate your understanding of the differences between a middle school and a junior high. 3.  List ONE change (based on what is presented or based on your knowledge of effective middle schools based on This We Believe) that could make MSU Middle School more representative of an exemplary middle school.

An RLC circuit is driven by an alternating current source at a driving frequency of 10,000 radians/second. The RMS voltage is 120 V (standard US plugs). The RLC circuits components have the following values: R = 200 ohms, L = 40 mH, C = 0.2 mF. 1. Draw the phasor diagram for this circuit with the relative peak voltages and angles represented accurately. 2. What is the magnitude and sign of the phase of the driving voltage with respect to the voltage across the resistor (or the current)? 3. The angular frequency o of the driving voltage source can be varied. For what angular frequency o is the total impedance Z = 2R?

Some types of colorblindness are sex-linked recessive traits carried on the X chromosome.  A woman who has normal vision, but who is a carrier for colorblindness, is pregnant with the child of a normal male (who is not colorblind). What is the probability that the child will be a son who is normal?
Use the accompanying figure and information to answer the question(s) below.Cells were infected with approximately 1000 copies of either virus A or virus B at the 0 time point. At 5-minute intervals, a sample of the virus and cell mixture was removed. The intact cells were removed from the sample, and the number of viruses per milliliter of culture was determined.Using the data in the figure, how long does it take for virus A to go through one lytic cycle?

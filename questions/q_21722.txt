Ion bond testing You are measuring an ionic bond between a +2e ion (pink) and a -1e ion (aqua), shown below.    You have a probe that controls a proton that you can use to estimate the strength of the ionic bond.  So, you place the probe's +1e proton at the midpoint between the two ions, whose locations are:    positive ion (0.00 nm, 0.00 nm, 0.00 nm) negative ion (0.200 nm, 0.00 nm, 0.00 nm)    Calculate the magnitude of the net force on the probe proton at the midpoint.  Work carefully and mind the geometry.

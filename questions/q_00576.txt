Which organism is most likely to be positive for catalase?
These organisms use a CO2 as carbon source and sunlight as an energy source.
Microorganisms in the human colon are more often described as mutualistic with human hosts rather than commensalistic. Why has this change in the definition of a symbiotic relationship occurred?
Literary Comprehension, Analysis, and Application The Book Thief by Markus ZusakRead the following selection and then answer the questions that follow. "'Hair the color of lemons,'" Rudy read.  His fingers touched the words.  "You told him about me?" At first, Liesel could not talk. Perhaps it was the sudden bumpiness of love she felt for him.  Or had she always loved him?  It's likely.  Restricted as she was from speaking, she wanted him to kiss her.  She wanted him to drag her hand across and pull her over.  It didn't matter where.  Her mouth, her neck, her cheek.  Her skin was empty for it, waiting. . . "Of course I told him about you," Liesel said. She was saying goodbye and she didn't even know it. Question: The above selection includes what conflict?

Three point charges are fixed in space on the coordinate system shown below. The coordinate axes are marked in meters.      a) Find the electric field at point P, located at the origin. b) Calculate the electric field at a point P' at position r= 11 mi + 8 mj [ r=(11 m, 8 m)]. c) Find the force on an additional charge of qo=-6.4x10-6 C placed at the origin. d) What is the force on a charge of 4.9x10-2 C if it is placed at point P'? part a)  Now calculate the magnitudes of each of the contributions to the electric field at point P.    = 1.636   x  105 N/C    = 1.001   x  105 N/C    = 9.250   x  105 N/C E2x= -4.477 x104 N/C E2y=  8.955 x104 N/C EP =   1.188 x105 N/C i + 1.014x106 N/C j = (1.188 x105 N/C , 1.014x106 N/C) part b)    =3.094 x  105 N/C    =3.56 x  104 N/C   =1.05 x  105 N/C         =2.93  x  105 N/C      =-2.268 x  105 N/C part c) Find the force on an additional charge of qo=-6.4x10-6 C placed at the origin 19. Calculate the y-component of the net force on the charge when it is placed at point P. Write your answer in standard form (not exponential) and round to 3 decimal places. Do not include units. Fy =?

A 5-year-old girl presented to genetics clinic after she exhibited severe developmental regression.  She was born in Colombia, and was the mother's second child; the older sibling was healthy. At 9 months of age, she exhibited a significant acoustic startle reflex and began to suffer from generalised myoclonic seizures.  At about 10 months of age, she showed some regression in developmental milestones: she did not follow objects with her eyes or grasp objects and had a weak suck. From the age of 11 months, the patient began to display progressive neurological impairment. At 2 years of age, she was diagnosed with blindness due to optic atrophy.  At the age of 3.5 years, she became completely disconnected from her environment, and hypotonia progressed to generalised spasticity.

A herd of 1,500 steer was fed a special high-protein grain for a month. A random sample of 29 were weighed and had gained an average of 6.7 pounds. If the standard deviation of weight gain for the entire herd is 7.1, test the hypothesis that the average weight gain per steer for the month was more than 5 pounds. What's the p-value for this question? (Hint: Consider the Ha first.)
Beta, Inc. is a factory that constantly pollutes the air with carcinogens. Carol lives next door to the factory and has for 20 years. Carol has smoked four packs of cigarettes every day for the last 30 years. Carol sues Beta, Inc., arguing that Beta, Inc., gave her lung cancer due to the carcinogens the factory expels in the air. At trial, the judge hears from an expert witness on different types of lung cancers and their causes. The expert witness testifies that the specific type of lung cancer that Carol has was 50% caused by her smoking cigarettes for the past 30 years, and the other 50% was caused Beta, Inc.'s bad emission standards of expelling too many carcinogens into the area.

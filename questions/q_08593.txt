Use the scenario shown below to write a patient care narrative in SOAPE format. Fill in any missing information based on your level of training and coursework. Use proper medical terminology and abbreviations where necessary.    You may type your narrative in Microsoft Word then copy & paste the narrative into Canvas. HOWEVER, you will not see the Canvas clock/timer while you are in Microsoft Word - it is YOUR responsibility to keep track of the time remaining and to paste your narrative into Canvas with enough time to submit the exam.    At 0130 your ALS transport unit is alerted for an MVC on an interstate highway. The incident location is approximately 10 minutes from a community hospital and 25 minutes from a trauma center. You arrive on location and see:         Your patient is a 22-year-old male that was ejected from the vehicle and found lying prone on the shoulder of the roadway approximately 30 feet away. Walking up to your patient you notice an obvious deformity to his left upper leg and you hear snoring respirations. Neither verbal or painful stimuli illicit any kind of response from your patient. Physical exam reveals bilateral bruising of the mastoid processes, pupils that are sluggishly-reactive at approximately 7 mm, JVD, absent breath sounds on the left accompanied by bruising and crepitus to the left chest, pelvic instability, and the deformed left upper leg. Numerous bruises and abrasions are on his head and left side of his body. Vital signs are BP 240/116, P 70, and R 6 and snoring. The patient's girlfriend is also on scene saying she saw the accident because she was following him home. The girlfriend says he has a history of diabetes (takes an oral medication for it) and says that they were at a pub until just before closing time where the patient had "two beers".

Canadian and Swiss researchers wanted to know if the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was important to the productivity of grasslands (M.G.A. van der Heijden, J. N. Klironomos, M. Ursic, P. Moutoglis, R. Streitwolf-Engel, T. Boler, A. Wiemken, and I. R. Sanders. 1998. Mycorrhizal fungal diversity determines plant biodiversity, ecosystem variability, and productivity. Nature 396:69-72). Specifically, they wanted to know if it mattered which specific AMF species were present, or just that some type of AMF was present. They grew various plants in combination with one of four AMF species (A, B, C, and D), no AMF species (O), or all four AMF species together (A + B + C + D); and they measured plant growth under each set of conditions. All plant species were grown in each plot, so they always competed with each other, with the only difference being which AMF species were present. On the graphs below, the x-axis labels indicate the number and identity of AMF species (bar 0 = no fungi; bars A - D = individual AMF species; bar A + B + C + D = all AMF species together). The y-axis indicates the amount (grams) of plant biomass for the species shown in italics above each graph.  Based on the graphs in the figures above, which of the following plant species is most likely not to form mycorrhizal associations?

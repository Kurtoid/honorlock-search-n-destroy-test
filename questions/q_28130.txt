IQ is normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Suppose one individual is randomly chosen. Let X = IQ of an individual. X ~N(100, 15)   The middle 50% of IQs fall between what two values?  [a6] <= x <= [a7] (Round to 2 decimal places as needed.)

You are studying a large population of stinkbugs in which a single gene with two alleles controls antenna length. Individuals that are homozygous AA have long antennae, those with aa genotype have short antennae, and heterozygotes have intermediate antennae. You sample the population and find that the frequency of the a allele is 0.80. A. What is the frequency of the A allele in the population? [v1] B. If the stinkbugs in this population are allowed to mate randomly, what is the expected frequency of the short antennae genotype in the next generation, assuming there are no evolutionary forces acting on the population? [v2] C. You return to the population 5 years later. A farmer has sprayed insecticide (poison) and killed all but 200 of the stinkbugs. What is the total size of the gene pool of this new generation of stinkbugs? [v3] D. You perform genetic tests and olfactory (smelling ability) tests on the remaining stinkbugs. You find that the frequency of the A allele increased, because bugs with longer antenna had higher survival than bugs with short antennae because they have a better ability to smell and avoid insecticide (you found this in your tests). Based on this information, the increase of the frequency of the A allele is most likely due to [v4]

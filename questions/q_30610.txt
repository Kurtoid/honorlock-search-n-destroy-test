In mammals, colostrum (or "first milk") is produced by the mother in late pregnancy and shortly after giving birth to feed the newborn. In addition to nutrients, it is particularly rich in antibodies that are absorbed through the intestinal epithelium and support the weak immune system of the infant. Occasionally, some infants suffer from either respiratory acidosis or alkalosis. In acidosis, the blood pH becomes acidic due to lack of sufficient ventilation, while the opposite happens in alkalosis due to hyperventilation. Considering the molecular mechanism of transcytosis in intestinal epithelia, which of these conditions--acidosis or alkalosis --would you expect to interfere more with antibody absorption by transcytosis in these infants?

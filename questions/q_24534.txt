Exhibit 4-1An industrial psychologist observed 8 drill-press operators for one working day. She recorded the number of times each operator pressed the "faster" button instead of the "stop" button to determine whether the design of the control panel was contributing to the high rate of accidents in the plant.

A simplified electric motor circuit is shown below along with an unlabeled fault tree diagram. Assuming the top event (TE) is that the "Motor fails to operate when power is applied to electric circuit", match the other intermediate and basic event descriptions to the various event identifiers in the fault tree. For example, "Internal motor faults" could cause the TE and can be shown as a basic event at the first level of contributors. Carefully consider the system schematic to determine how to organize all the remaining events in the fault tree, beginning with current not reaching the motor (at the first level) and expanding to underlying causes.

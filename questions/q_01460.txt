Students enrolled in STA2023 this semester completed a survey at the beginning of the term. The questions asked included whether the student had submitted SAT scores when applying to UF, and if so, what score they submitted for the Reading and Writing portion (RW) and the Math portion (M).  The data for a random sample of 10 of those students appears below.         student   RW   M   Diff     1   680   730   -50     2   620   530   90     3   800   600   200     4   650   700   -50     5   500   600   -100     6   690   790   -100     7   780   650   130     8   660   600   60     9   650   500   150     10   670   580   90           Do students score better in the Reading and Writing portion than the Math portion? We can analyze this data with either a Matched Pairs t Test, the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, or the Sign Test for the Median.  The biggest difference among the three tests is that the conclusions for: [conclusions] The story tells us that the sample was randomly selected. This is important for: [random] Which other assumptions are necessary for these tests? [assumptions] Compute W- for the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test: [W-ts] The Sign Test for the Median computes the p-value by finding the probability of observing: [Binomial] The three tests use different amounts of information. Which of the following statements is true? [info] Interpret the p-values:  t test: 0.127;  Wilcoxon: 0.131; Sign test: 0.377. [pval]

These questions are related to the design principles for secure systems.  Many people use the same password across many websites. Give examples of two design principles for secure systems that are violated by the use of the same password across different websites. Provide a brief explanation for each example. (4 pts.)  The "Reflections on Trusting Trust" paper described a trojan in a compiler binary that could not be detected even if we had access to the source of the compiler. We discussed how the defense in depth principle can help us detect if the trojan exists in a compiler by using two independently developed compilers when at least one of them is correct. We could determine if one of the compilers has the trojan but could not ascertain which one is malicious. To answer this question, the following idea is proposed. Instead of two, we will get three independently developed compilers such that no more than one could be malicious.1. Can we use these three compilers (at least two of them are good) to detect the bad one when one exists? (3 pts.)2. Explain your answer. (3 pts.)

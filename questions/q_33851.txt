The graph below shows swelling rate vs. dpa curves for 316 stainless steel and HT9 steel. Based on what we know about these materials, which one swells more? Identify which curve (green vs red) corresponds to 316SS and which one to HT9. Once you have identified the curves, explain your rationale. You have to clarify what guided the selection process to get full credit.

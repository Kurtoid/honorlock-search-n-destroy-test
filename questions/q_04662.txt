In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Shands Hospital at UF has decided to expand its hospital room capacity with an additional 72 upgraded patient care rooms to the main building. Rooms are approximately 500 square feet (sq ft) in size and are expected to cost $600/sq ft fully equipped at buildout. During construction, the plan is for 4,000 square feet (space equivalent to 8 rooms) to be completed (on average) each month for 9 months. The estimated cost of the entire project is $21,600,000. You are the University of Florida construction PM responsible for managing the design-build contractor for the new addition. The table below represents the status of your project at the end of Month 5 as reported to you by the contractor; you have verified the report against project progress and believe it to be accurate:  Answer the following questions and show your work! 1. What is the cumulative planned value to date? 2. What is the cumulative earned value to date? 3. What is the cumulative actual cost to date? 4. Calculate the cumulative CPI through the end of the statusing period (end of Month 5). 5. Calculate the cumulative SPI through the same time period. 6. What is the estimated final cost based on progress through Month 5? 7. What is the estimated total time of completion (in months)? 8.

You have a circular coil of 40 loops of wire with an area of 0.03 m2 that you want to place into a uniform magnetic field with a strength of 0.01 T.   Make a sketch showing how you would orient the coil inside the magnetic field so that the wire would feel the largest torque if a current were flowing through it. You may choose any direction for the magnetic field, but be sure to clearly indicate the direction of the field in your sketch.

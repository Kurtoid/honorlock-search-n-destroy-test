Pew Research investigated the use of online dating sites by Americans in a recent research report.  The data indicates that even though more people are using dating sites, 53% of women in their sample still view online dating as a more dangerous way of meeting people when compared to other methods.   You decide to gather data from a random sample of women in Laramie and want to test the claim that the majority of women (in Laramie) believe online dating to be a more dangerous way of meeting people.  Out of the 200 women in Laramie you sampled, 116 believed online dating to be dangerous.  Provide a full hypothesis test and use a p-value to make your decision.

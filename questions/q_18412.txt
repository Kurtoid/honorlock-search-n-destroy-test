Taylor Concrete Repair Co. contracted with Smith to replace portions of Smith's sidewalk which were cracked.  Smith lived at 402 Oliver Street and Taylor's price quotation was based on an inspection of Smith's sidewalk by one of Taylor's supervisors.  On May 1, Taylor sent out one of its crews to do the work at Smith's house.  Unfortunately, the crew supervisor (who was not the one that had earlier inspected Smith's sidewalk) thought the address on the work order was "405" Oliver Street.  The Taylor crew drove up and down Oliver Street looking for 405 Oliver.  Mary Jacobs lives at 405 Oliver Street but she was not home that day - she was at work.  The crew unloaded all of their tools and equipment and began to work on Jacobs' sidewalk which was also in need of repair.  Jacobs came home from work and was surprised to see her sidewalk repaired.  A few days later the mistake was discovered by Taylor and it sent a bill to Jacobs for the fair value of the sidewalk repair work that was done.  Jacobs refused to pay the bill.

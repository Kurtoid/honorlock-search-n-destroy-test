Dalton's law of partial pressures states that the total pressure in the mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the component gases. Hydrogen gas (H2) can be prepared by the reaction of zinc with hydrochloric acid and then trapping the gas produced in an inverted buret filled with water. If the total pressure of the gas in the collection tube is 728.6 mm Hg at 25degC, what is the partial pressure of the hydrogen gas if the vapor pressure of water is 21.3 mmHg.

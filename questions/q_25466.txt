Tableau Task 2       (max 12 pts)   Create a new worksheet in your Tableau workbook.  Name it "Bar Graph".

Create a horizontal bar graph as follows:  One bar for each regional manager (be sure it's the regional manager, not local). The length of each bar is set by the average Customer Visits for all of that manager's restaurants. Create a filter so that only the top 5 managers are displayed. Sort the bars so that the longest bar is on the top, shortest on the bottom.    NOTES:   This task will be graded manually, based on our evaluation of the TWBX file you submit.

An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a biomedical device that applies a high voltage pulse for a very short duration to disrupt cardiac arrhythmias and "restart" the heart's activity. The operation of an AED can be modeled (oversimplified) as a dipole. The AED electrodes are placed on the chest of the patient such that the current source (+I) is above the heart and the sink (-I) is below it. The heart can be modeled as a rectangular prism (cuboid) with conductance,

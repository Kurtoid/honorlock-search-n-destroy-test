QUESTION: Using the resources shown in the provided images, write the code that should appear inside the RadioButtons' CheckedChanged event. (Do not write the procedure heading template - only the code that belongs inside.)     Overall Requirements: (each of these will be addressed in a separate question)  Declare and create an array of RadioButton objects. Load the RadioButtons on the form into the array in the form Load event. Code the Load Data button to load the contents of the ClientCharges.txt file (found in the bindebug folder) into the ListBox. While loading, count the number of clients and keep a running total of the charges.  Do not read through the ListBox - do this while loading from the file.   Capture the selection made for a radio button in the RadioButtons' CheckedChanged event and store it in a variable for use in the btnShow code. Code the btnClear Click event to clear the ListBox and to clear the selections made for the RadioButtons. Clear any calculated statistical values. Use the array of RadioButton objects to clear the selection. Code the btnShow Click event to show the desired statistical value based on the captured selection made for the radio buttons. Display the statistic information in a MessageBox.  Validate that data has been loaded into the ListBox before attempting to show an analysis choice. Validate that a selection was made for the RadioButtons (use the captured value - do not recheck all radio buttons). Use a Select Case structure to set the statistics message to be displayed.   Code the btnExit click event to end the program  CODE TEMPLATE   QUESTION: Using the resources shown in the provided images, write the code that should appear inside the RadioButtons' CheckedChanged event.

You are attempting to purify a Red Fluorescent protein. You screen a variety of chromatographic techniques for their use.  a) When you look at gel filtration as a potential technique, you obtain the following interesting results. Provide a rationale for this observation. b) You decide to try and use Phenyl-sepharose chromatography for purification. You load and run the column using a gradient that runs from 2 M ammonium sulfate to 0 M ammonium sulfate (pushing a column volume of 0 M ammonium sulfate through at the end)   but after the run, you find your column red...the protein is stuck on the column (none has been eluted). Assuming everything ran fine and the buffers are all ok, what would you do to get your protein off the column in an active form (do not alter pH) and why?

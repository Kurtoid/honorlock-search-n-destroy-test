Delegate, who planned to attend the convention of Political Party, reserved a room at Hotel for the seven days scheduled around the convention at the drastically reduced rate of $100 per night. The reduced rate was a special offer made only to delegates who reserved their rooms by paying $400 as an advance deposit for a full seven-night booking at Hotel. Delegate timely paid her deposit. Same facts as the previous question, except that Hotel was not destroyed by a fire. Instead, Political Party suddenly moved its convention to another city. What statement is most true?

5. Determine the location/orientation of the image (using ray tracing method) of an inverted object located to the left and outside the focal length of a DCX.                             6. An isosceles prism with an apex angle of 250 has an index of refraction of 1.61. Determine the minimum angle of deviation for this prism.                           7. An object is located 120-cm to the left of a lens (DCV) with a 75-cm focal length. Determine: a) Image distance; b) Magnification c) Describe the image.                         8. A PCX lens has a focal length of 25 cm and an index of 1.52. The lens is submerged in water (1.33). Determine the values for R1 and R2. Note: The convex surface is the 1st surface.                       9. Determine the relative aperture for a 1.5" diameter lens, knowing that the focal length is 12.5 cm.                             10. You are handed a concave mirror with a radius of curvature of 40 cm and an object is placed 46 cm in front of the mirror. a) What is the focal length of the mirror? b) Where is the image located and how far is it from the mirror? c) Is the image found in part b) real? Explain. d) Is the image larger or smaller than the object? What is the magnification? e) Make a ray-trace diagram to locate the position and size of the image formed.                                 11. A two-lens system is made up of a converging lens (DCX) followed by a diverging lens (DCV), each of focal length 150 mm. The system is used to form an image of an object 1.5 cm high, standing erect, 270 mm from the first lens. The two lenses are separated by a distance of 60 cm. Describe the image formed by this system.

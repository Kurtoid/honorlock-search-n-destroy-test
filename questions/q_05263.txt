Teagard agrees to the interview and suggests that it be held in his office for convenience as he has a very busy schedule that day. At the scheduled time, you and NNS's corporate attorney arrive at Teagard's office. The attorney obtains Teagard's permission to lock the door to ensure there will be no interruptions. The shade on Teagard's office window is left open to provide more light. Teagard is seated at his desk, and you and the attorney take seats on the opposite side with the office door behind you. You begin by asking Teagard some introductory questions; however, he quickly he becomes aware that he is under suspicion of fraud. At this point, Teagard stops and says that he wants to speak to an attorney. The corporate attorney says "Don't worry, that's why I'm here." Questioning then resumes.

Congratulations on an excellent semester; you've been a fantastic group of students, flexible with the use of in-person and virtual aspects to our class. We've approached the final exam with strong grades, based on many Narratives, group presentations, and a midterm exam. As we have all learned in education, a final exam is catered to separate those who earn and truly deserve As from Bs and Cs after an entire semester of content-learning. The hope is that this final leaves us with grades in a good place, having evaluated our performance through mostly knowledge-based questions but also a few critical-thinking based ones.   A friendly reminder: Final grades in this course will not be curved or rounded up. Any request for additional extra credit or special exceptions to the grading policy, which were described in the syllabus, may be interpreted as an honor code violation (i.e. asking for preferential treatment) and will be handled accordingly. So, please refrain from inquiring.

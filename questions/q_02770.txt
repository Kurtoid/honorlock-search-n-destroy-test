Right click on the button below to open the image on a new page                   Summer flexes its muscles all the more South Africa's summers are now six months in length Research is showing that our summers have, over the past 35 years, increased its duration. This is the first time that season lengths have been properly measured using the minimum, average and maximum daily temperatures. Researchers have used the data from 35 weather stations that was collected between 1980 and 2015. Climate is determined by a minimum of a thirty-year period, exactly what the research has done. Usually South Africa's seasons have lasted for an average of three months each, but research is now showing that this has changed. Summer in South Africa is now six months long. The spring season has been cut short. In one instant it is still winter and in the next moment it is summer. Spring has been lost. Research is showing that not only are we having a shorter spring but we are also having a short winter. No longer will our seasons be measured in months. Rather it will be weeks. This phenomenon is not restricted to South Africa. Right across the entire world season lengths are changing and this is as a direct result of climate change and global warming.

Assuming union-by-size and find-with-path-compression are used, executing the following program results in the P-array shown below (MAKE-SET makes a disjoint set containing its argument; For UNION, if two trees have the same size, make the second tree a child of the root of the first tree): for i = 1 to 10       MAKE-SET(i) i = 1 repeat       UNION(i, i+1)       i = i+2 until i > 10 UNION(1, 3) FIND(4)   P-Array after the program finishes:    What should be the values marked ?? in the array above? Hint: It might help to draw the trees though only the circled answer will be graded.

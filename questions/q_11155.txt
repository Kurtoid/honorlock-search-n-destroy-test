According to the terms of the agreement signed by the parties, the businesswoman took the boutique "subject to the mortgage" and agreed to "assume payment of" the mortgage. Shortly thereafter, a popular shopping center opened in the same town and the businesswoman found herself in financial trouble with the boutique.

The new shopping mall had caused the value of smaller retail space in the town to plummet and the boutique sold for only $90,000. After the $90,000 was applied to the mortgage, $80,000 was still owing on the principal amount. The bank can seek to recover the deficiency from which of the following parties?

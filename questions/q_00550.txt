His health history includes recent dry mouth, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. He takes blood pressure medication and shares that he has been undergoing changes to his diabetes prescriptions to gain better control of his sugar levels.

He also complains of a metallic taste that seems to be exacerbated with this recent onslaught of lesions. Clinical exam reveals white leukoplakic patches on the right and left lateral borders of the tongue and on the buccal mucosa throughout the oral cavity; a swipe with gauze removed the lesions.

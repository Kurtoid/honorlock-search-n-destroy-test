EEL 5490 and EEL 4495  Test 3 Spring 2021    A balloon carrying a vertical electric field sensor ascends from ground to 16 km. The measured vertical electric field versus height is shown below.     (a) (10%) How many charge regions (layers) are there and where are they located? What is the polarity of the cloud charge regions? Answers:     (b) (10%) What is the volume charge density in each cloud charge region? What is the volume of the lowest charge region, if the absolute value of its total charge is 4 C? Assume that the volume charge density is uniform within the cloud charge region. Answers:      A cloud has positive and negative charge regions separated vertically as shown below (vertical-dipole charge structure).     (a) (20%) Sketch the electric field intensity on ground due to each of the two charges and due to the entire charge system vs. range (horizontal distance from the axis of the dipole) using the atmospheric electricity sign convention.   (b) (20%) Sketch the electric field change vs. range if one-half of the negative cloud charge is neutralized via a cloud-to-ground lightning discharge.   (c) (20%) Sketch the electric field change vs. range if both the positive and negative cloud charges are completely neutralized via an intracloud discharge.      3. (20%). In no less than one-half but no more than one page discuss in your own words the main cloud electrification models. Is the electrical conductivity inside a cloud (a) higher than, (b) lower than, or (c) the same as that outside the cloud? Explain why.

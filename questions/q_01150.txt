Eye Accommodation :You are playing intramural softball and you are in center field. The batter hits a high pop fly to you. After the ball reaches its peak and starts falling it is approaching you. In order for you to continually see the ball clearly your eyes have to make some adjustments. Both eyes have to move [1](1: A or B) by contracting the [2] (2) muscles which are innervated by the [3](3) nerve this makes sure light stays focused on the [4](4: as specific as possible) where most of the cones are found. The pupils also have to change size as the ball approaches because the closer it is to your eye the more[5] (5: P or Q) light rays reach the eyes. Therefore the pupils [6](6: T or U) via contraction of the [7](7) muscles which are innervated by the [8](8) nerve. Finally, in order to appropriately focus the light rays that get through the pupils the [9](9) muscles must [10](10: R or S), by way of the [11](11) nerve, in order to make the lens [12](12: V, W, or X).     A. Medially   E. Superior obliques   I. Ciliary   M. Trochlear   Q. Divergent   U. Constrict     B. Laterally   F. Inferior obliques   J. Optic   N. Retina   R. Contract   V. More convex     C. Lateral recti   G. Pupillary Dilator   K. Oculomotor   O. Fovea centralis   S. Relax   W. Less convex     D. Medial recti   H. Pupillary Sphincter   L. Abducens   P. Parallel   T. Dilate   X.

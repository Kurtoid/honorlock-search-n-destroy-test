One study documented that between Blacks and Whites the total difference in the disease prevalence 60%. However, the component analysis indicates of the total disparity: portions attributable: gender physiology 15%, occupational exposure 20%, neighborhood 10%, genetic 5%, access to care 30% and miscommunication between healthcare provider and patients 10% and undetermined 10%. List the components can be considered health inequity.
Free Response: Answer all questions, showing all work while you are still logged into the Canvas quiz. Once you have completed your work, type your final answer into the essay box below. Once you have typed your answer in, you can close the quiz and then should upload a picture of your work to the free-response assignment within 10 minutes of closing the quiz. Key equations and a Periodic Table to be used for the whole quiz are included below:pH = -log[H3O+]pH + pOH = 14[H3O+][OH-]=1.0 x 10-14Kw=1.0 x 10-14pKa=-log(Ka)pKa + pKb=14Free Response 1: A 0.30 M solution of weak acid HA has a pH of 4.3. What is the Ka of this acid? (5 points)Free Response 2: Acetic acid, CH3CO2H, has a Ka of 1.8 x 10-5. Determine the pH of a 1.2 M solution of acetic acid. (5 points)Free Response 3: Determine the pH and concentrations of all species present at equilibrium (H2C6H6O6, HC6H6O6-, C6H6O62-, H3O+, and OH-) of a 0.0500 M solution of the diprotic acid, H2C6H6O6. . (12 points)Free Response 4: A solution is created by combining 0.45 moles of NH3 with 0.60 moles of NH4+ in 5.0 L of total solution. If the Kb of NH3 is 1.8 x 10-5, determine the pH of this solution. (5 points)Free Response 5: A titration is run between a 0.30 M solution of HX and NaOH. If the Kb of X- is 1.0 x 10-7, determine the pH of this solution at the equivalence point. (5 points)

Microtubules are key components of the cytoskeleton and play a central role in cell division and development. Microtubules assembly is known to be associated with a structural change in a- / b-tubulin dimers from kinked to straight conformations. The slower phase of microtubule assembly in which a small portion of the microtubule is initially formed is called

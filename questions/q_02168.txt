Case study #3 Dental caries (dental decay) is the result of solubilization (dissolving) of tooth enamel by acid. The microbes associated with cavities, usually the Gram-positive Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species living in biofilms as plaque, produce organic acids as the waste product of a specific metabolic pathway. Regular tooth brushing and chewing gum after meals, which increases saliva production, and are the two leading methods that can be preformed daily to prevent tooth decay.   What is the name of the enzyme that is found in saliva, tears, and mucous membranes, that degrades peptidoglycan?

The shown beam section is subjected to a vertical shear = 50 kip. The Moment of Inertia (I) for the W-shape is = 394 in4.  Determine the horizontal shear stress in the top flange of the beam cross-section at the shown point "a". The dimensions and the moment of inertia of the cross-section are shown.  Q = A*distance,  Shear Stress t = VQ/It,  F = shear flow (q) * Spacing

GELO #6 - Question 6 Carl is conducting an experiment to determine if increased ultraviolet radiation from the decrease in the ozone layer is killing off frog tadpoles. After examining all of the data available in the library, Carl decides to go with a hypothesis that increased ultraviolet radiation from the sun is killing off the tadpoles.    Carl puts tadpoles into two groups. Group 1 involves 100 tadpoles in a five gallon container of water, which is covered by glass (knowing that the glass will filter out the ultraviolet radiation). Group 2 will be set up exactly like Group 1, except instead of being covered with glass, it is covered with an acrylic plexiglass, which will not filter out the ultraviolet radiation. Carl then places the groups outside for a period of one month, and observes the results.       Which group is the control group (Group 1 or Group 2)?

The following question pertains to the original passage and citation below:     Wilbur, Richard. "The Three Privations of Emily Dickinson." Literature: An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, and Drama, edited by X. J. Kennedy and Dana Gioia, Pearson, 2010, pp.969-70.   An original passage from page 1111 of the excerpted essay by Wilbur: "That hers was a species of religious personality goes without saying; but by her refusal of such ideas as original sin, redemption, hell, and election, she made it impossible for herself--as [biographer George F.] Whicher observed--'to share the religious life of her generation.'  She became an unsteady congregation of one."   Evaluate the following attempt by a student writer to use details from the passage above; choose the option that best describes the student's attempt to paraphrase the secondary source.  Student Writing: Many scholars, including Richard Wilbur, agree that although Dickinson felt a need for a religious faith, she could not accept some common Christian beliefs (Wilbur 1111).

Four capacitors labeled C1 through C5 are connected to a 20.0 V battery as shown. The capacitances values are on the figure below. Assume the capacitors are fully charged.   a) Calculate the equivalent (total) capacitance, Ceq , of the network.  Hint: Identify the capacitors in parallel, then combine. Redraw the circuit every time you combine capacitors and keep track of the voltage and the charge rules. b) What is the charge on each capacitor? c) What is the potential difference (voltage) across each capacitor?   Create a table as shown by using "insert table" above with 3 columns and 6 rows. Label each column as shown and then enter your values in the table you created before you submit your test. Use three (3) significant figures and make sure you email me your work after you submit your test.     Capacitance (

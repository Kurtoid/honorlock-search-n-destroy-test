Human and other animal waste can result in water and air pollution(a) Eutrophication of waterways is a potential environmental problem that can result from concentrated animal feeding operations.s       i. Describe how eutrophication negatively affects waterways.       ii. Propose a realistic solution to prevent eutrophication of waterways near       iii. Justify the solution you described in (a)(ii) with an additional environmental benefit. (b) Organic materials (such as food scraps and yard waste) in landfills can decompose and produce landfill gas (LFG) over time. About 50% of LFG is methane, a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 25 times higher than that of carbon dioxide over a-100 year period. LFG can be collected and burned to produce electricity.      i. Explain a process during which LFG is burned to produce electricity.      ii. The Puente Hills Landfill in California contains about 123 million tons of landfill waste and burns LFG to produce electricity. In a typical landfill, one million tons of landfill waste emits approximately 432,000 cubic feet of LFG per day.          Calculate how much LFG is emitted at the Puente Hills Landfill per year.      iii. Burning LFG for electricity produces the additional benefit of preventing methane from entering the atmosphere. Calculate how much methane is prevented from entering the atmosphere by burning LFG to produce electricity at the Puente Hills Landfill over a 10-year period.

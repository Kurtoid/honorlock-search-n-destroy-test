A student wants to determine the number of bacteria in a large colony of Bacillus cereus growing on a TSA plate. He first re-suspends the entire colony in one milliliter of diluent and then adds the diluted colony to 99 mL of diluent. From this dilution bottle, he serially dilutes the sample another ten-fold by pipetting 1.0 mL into 9.0 mL diluent. He plates 0.1 mL from this dilution tube onto the agar surface of a TSA plate. After incubation, he counts 102 colonies. Based on the these results, what is the number of bacteria in the original bacterial colony?

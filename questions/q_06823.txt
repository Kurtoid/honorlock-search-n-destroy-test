You remember learning that when assessing murmurs it is best to use dynamic cardiac auscultation and you then ask him to bear down like he is having a bowel movement and continue to listen to the murmur. You notice that the murmur gets louder during Valsalva. What do you think might be causing his heart murmur and dyspnea? Choose the best option.

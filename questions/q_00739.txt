The following question came from the Mastering Biology homework.    Which of the following statements correctly describe(s) the driving forces for diffusion of Na+ and K+ ions through their respective channels? Select all that apply. (a) The diffusion of Na+ ions into the cell is facilitated by the Na+ concentration gradient across the plasma membrane.(b) The diffusion of Na+ ions into the cell is impeded by the electrical gradient across the plasma membrane.(c) The diffusion of K+ ions out of the cell is impeded by the K+ concentration gradient across the plasma membrane.(d) The diffusion of K+ ions out of the cell is impeded by the electrical gradient across the plasma membrane.(e) The electrochemical gradient is larger for Na+ than for K+. Explain why options (a), (d), and (e) are correct.  (Note: Please write your response for each option separately for ease of grading.  Also, you must adequately explain/defend your answer to demonstrate that you truly understand the material.)

During an Ames test, an experimental sample of His- bacteria was exposed to a potential mutagen. As a control, another sample of the same His- bacteria was not exposed to the mutagen. A total of 10 million bacteria from each sample were then plated on different plates containing media that did not contain histidine. The results were as follows: Control plate (not exposed to potential mutagen): 12 colonies Experimental plate (exposed to potential mutagen): 1097 colonies   Do the results indicate that the potential mutagen was mutagenic?

Read the following paragraph and answer questions 45 through 48At the heart of every Xerox machine, a xerographic plate or drum. The xerographic surface consists of a thin layer of selenium on an aluminium sheet support. Between the aluminium and the selenium is a very thin layer - only about 10 atoms thick -- of aluminium oxide.The electrical properties of each of these are very important to the xerographic process.Aluminium is a good conductor of electricity. Aluminium oxide is an insulator. Selenium is a special type of semiconductor known as a photoconductor. A photoconductot is a substance which conducts electricity only when light shines on it. When placed in darkness, it becomes an insulator.Because selenium coating is an insulator when in darkness, an electrostatic charge can be placed on the surface of the plate. Provided the plate is kept in darkness, the charge will remain for a long time. If the plate is exposed to light, the selenium becomes a conductor and is able to conduct the charge away to the aluminium sheet where it is neutralized. The plate is thereby discharged.The insulating aluminium oxide layer slows down the rate of discharge, but is not thick enough to prevent discharge altogether.The selenium on the xerographic plates is specially treated to make it good photoconductor. It is very sensitive and can easily lose its photoconducting property. To keep the selenium in good condition:1. it must be kept clean-- for example, it must not come into contact with any grease, oil, water etc2. any crystalline selenium must be removed from its surface3. it must be kept coolWhat could happen if a copier had an improperly fitted door that allowed light to reach inside of the copier

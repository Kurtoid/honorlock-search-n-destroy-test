Use the following scenario to answer questions 1-2. (5 points total). Chagas disease is caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi. This disease is common in South American countries such as Bolivia and Paraguay.  In fact, in some communities, over 70% of the population is infected with the parasite.  In approximately 30% of the population, the parasite infection will lead to chronic cardiac symptoms.  Figure 1 below is an EKG from a patient infected with Chagas.  Each small square corresponds to a .2 sec interval.    How does a Chagas patient's EKG compare to a normal EKG? Provide at least two differences between this EKG and a normal EKG. (2 points)   Predict what part of the heart electrical conduction pathway might be impaired as a result of the Chagas infection. Explain your rationale. (3 points)

Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reversible reaction:         Pyruvate + NADH + H+    -    Lactate + NAD+       Given the following facts (a) tell in which direction the reaction will tend to go if NAD+, NADH, pyruvate, and lactate were mixed, all at 1 M concentrations, in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase at pH 7; (b) calculate DG'deg for this reaction. Show your work.     NAD+ + H+ + 2e- - NADH    E'deg = -0.32 V     pyruvate + 2H+ + 2e- - lactate    E'deg = -0.19 V     The Faraday constant, I, is 96.48 kJ/V*mol.

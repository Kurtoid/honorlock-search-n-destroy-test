Case Study 2 Maria is a 23-year-old single woman who was referred to therapy by her cardiologist. In the prior 2 months, she presented to the emergency room four times for acute complaints of heart palpitations, shortness of breath, sweats, trembling, and the fear that she was about to die. Each of these symptoms had a rapid onset. The symptoms peaked within minutes, leaving her scared, exhausted, and fully convinced that she had just experienced a heart attack. Medical evaluations done right after these episodes yielded normal physical exam findings, vital signs, lab results, toxicology screens, and electrocardiograms. Maria reported a total of five such attacks in the prior 3 months, occurring at work, at home, and while driving a car. She developed a persistent fear of having other attacks, which led her to take many days off work and to avoid exercise, driving, and coffee. Her sleep quality declined, as did her mood. She avoided social relationships. She did not accept the reassurance offered to her by friends or her doctor, believing that the medical workups were negative because they were performed after the resolution of the symptoms. She continued to suspect that something was wrong with her heart and that without an accurate diagnosis, she was going to die. When she had a panic attack while asleep in the middle of the night, she finally agreed to see a therapist. Maria denied a history of previous psychiatric disorders except for a history of anxiety during childhood that had been diagnosed as a "school phobia." Her mother committed suicide by overdose 4 years ago in the context of a recurrent major depression. Maria is currently living with her father and two younger siblings. She graduated from high school, is working as a telephone operator, and is not dating anyone. Her family and social histories were otherwise noncontributory. On mental status examination, Maria was an anxious-appearing, cooperative, coherent young person. She denied depression but did appear worried and preoccupied with ideas of having heart disease. She denied psychotic symptoms, confusion, and all suicidality. Her cognition was intact, insight was limited, and judgement was fair.

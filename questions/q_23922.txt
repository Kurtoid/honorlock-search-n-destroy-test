A car is approaching a van going in the same direction on a straight, level highway. The driver of the car is distracted by their phone and is going faster than the van in the same lane, and the car runs into the back of the van. Since both drivers are wearing their seatbelts and both vehicles are equipped with airbags, neither driver is seriously injured.  Assume that neither driver had time to apply the brakes before or during the collision. Immediately after the collision the two vehicles are stuck to each other, and the wheels are still rolling. The car has mass m=1,300 kg and is moving at v=81.0 mph, and the van has mass M=3,400 kg and is moving at V=70.0 mph. Use a coordinate system where positive vectors point to the right.    a) What is the total momentum of the car and van system (in kg m/s units) before the collision? b) What is the velocity of the car/van immediately after the collision? c) What is the direction of the net force on the car during the collision? Explain in one sentence how you know this. d) What is the direction of the net force on the van during the collision? Explain in one sentence how you know this. e) Which is larger, the magnitude of the acceleration of the car, or the magnitude of the acceleration of the van? Explain in one sentence how you know this.

7.  Time magazine reported in a 2004 survey of 507 randomly selected adult American Catholics, that 279 answered yes to the question "Do you favor allowing women to be priests?"  Conduct a test of hypothesis to determine if this data (279 out of 507) shows that the population proportion of adult American Catholics who favor allowing women to be priests is more than 0.50. (While answering the following sub-parts of this question, you will be including the null and alternative hypothesis, the test statistic, the p-value (a visualization and an interpretation), your statistical decision, and your conclusion in the context of the problem.) (c)  What area of the z-distribution should be shaded for the p-value in Step 3 of the hypothesis test?

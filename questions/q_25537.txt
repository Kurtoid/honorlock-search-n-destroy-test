Suppose a region's workforce of 12 million is initially evenly split between two cities, X and Y . The urban growth utility curve peaks at 4 million workers, and beyond that point the slope is - $5 per million workers (as the number of workers increases by a million workers, the utility drops by $5). The initial equilibrium utility level is $80. Suppose city X experiences technological innovation that shifts its utility curve upward by $10.    [6 points] In the new equilibrium, the utility level is ______________ and the population of X is ______________ million, while the population of Y is ______________ million. [6 points] Identify the direction of migration immediately following city X experiences technological innovation and explain your answer.
As you know from class, there has been some concerns about the potential effects of ecotourism on shark behavior. A study published in 2016 examined the effects of shark "feeding dives" (also known as shark provisioning) on behavior of whitetip reef sharks, which are a sluggish species that are capable of resting on the seafloor and buccal pumping.  They measured shark activity patterns using accelerometer tags to measure body acceleration. The graph below shows the results of this study.  It shows the activity of sharks during the time at which they were provisioned ("provisioning time") as well as their average activity levels during the day and nights that they were provisioned and the average activity levels on the days and nights that they were not provisioned. Based on these data, is there any evidence that provisioning alters shark behavior in some way?

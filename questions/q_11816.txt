QUESTION 3             A student carried out an experiment to determine the speed v of sound in air. She used the musical instrument shown, in which standing waves are produced by blowing into the instrument to vibrate the air inside.                           Right click on the button to open a diagram of the musical instrument in a new window.                             The length l of the vibrating air column is changed by covering the holes. This changes the frequency f of the sound produced. She measured f for different values of l. Her results are shown in the table.                           Right click on the button to open table of results in a new window.                         a.   Criticise her results.   (1)                   b.   Complete the last column of the table below. Only write down the answers for the last column underneath each other.   Right click on the button to open the table in a new window.      (3)                   c.   Plot a graph of f on the y-axis against 1/l on the x-axis on the grid provided and draw a line of best fit.   (4)                   d.   Determine the gradient of your graph.   (2)                    e.   The equation for the graph is f = v/2l.  Calculate a value for v.    (3)                   f.   The accepted value for v is 330 m s-1. Assuming your calculations are correct, suggest why there is a difference between your value for v and the accepted value.   (1)

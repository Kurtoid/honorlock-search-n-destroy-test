Classic Problems of Synchronization 8. [Lisonbee] The bounded buffer problem is a result of producing and consuming work asynchronously at different and/or variable rates. Provided below are implementations for producer and consumer functions which use semaphores to solve the bounded buffer problem:   int data[8], i0 = 0, i1 = 0; semaphore mutex = 1;semaphore empty = 8;semaphore full = 0; void producer() {    while (1) {        wait(empty);        wait(mutex); // LINE 1        data[i0] = (i0 + (i0 * i1)) % 32;        i0 = ++i0 % 16;        signal(mutex); // LINE 2        signal(full);    }} void consumer() {    while (1) {        wait(full);        wait(mutex);        printf("%dn", data[i1]);        i1 = ++i1 % 16;        signal(mutex);        signal(empty);    }}   What would happen if the commented lines in the producer function (LINE1 & LINE2) were removed? Would the implementation still solve the bounded buffer problem? If so, explain what effects removing these lines would have on the execution of the functions. If not, why are those lines necessary to solving the bounded buffer problem? Justify your answer.

The following questions will be based on the reading below. After reading the passage, answer the following questions related to main idea below before continuing. El Sistema - Changing Education and Communities (1) Education is about learning math, science, and history, right? Perhaps, but one man in Venezuela is sure that education is about a lot more than that. (2) Dr. Jose Abreu sees education as a way out of poverty for children and a way to change communities. He thinks this is all possible through music education. In 1975, Dr. Abreu began El Sistema (Spanish for The System), a program that provides an education in classical music to the young people of Venezuela, even those who live in the poorest communities. (3) Dr. Abreu wanted the children to have the opportunity to learn classical music, but he also wanted them to learn about personal responsibility, the importance of hard work, and working effectively in a group. He wanted to include the families and communities in order to provide support for the young musicians. Today, more than 300,000 young people in Venezuela are participating in El Sistema. The program has been so successful that it is now expanding rapidly. Programs based on this approach have been launched in locations all over the world and now reach almost 2 million people. (4) This success made scholars wonder how broad its impact might be. In other words, they wanted to know if the program has impact beyond the development of the children's musical abilities. Several studies of music education have found that it can have a range of positive effects. One study found that studying music "enhances child development, providing intellectual and emotional benefits that last a lifetime." This effect was particularly strong among children who play a musical instrument. (5) In general, music education is associated with higher academic performance, both in math and in reading. One evaluation found that the program promoted students' cognitive, personal, and social skills, in addition to their musical skills. It improved their memory, attention, and confidence. Students in the El Sistema program did better in school than students who were not in the program. They were also far more likely to stay in school until graduation. (6) One aspect of these research findings is particularly important. In poor countries or in poor areas of a country, there is often not a lot of money for education, particularly for music education. Perhaps the government feels that music education is optional and the children should concentrate on their studies in math, language, and science instead. However, it is exactly these poor children who could get the greatest benefit from a music education program like El Sistema.  Main Idea: Match each paragraph main idea below to a paragraph from the reading. Write the number of the paragraphs in the blanks below. [mainidea1] Research shows that music education helps with other skills. [mainidea2] El Sistema began in Venezuela and was designed to give poor children an opportunity to learn classical music. [mainidea3] Music education has been especially helpful for poor children.

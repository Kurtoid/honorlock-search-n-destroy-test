The manager finds a packet of last year's green bean seeds and plants them as a test.  Although the packet claims a germination rate of 92%, only 172 of 200 test seeds sprout.  Is this evidence that the seeds have lost viability during a year in storage? Test the claim that the germination rate after being stored for a year is less than 92%.

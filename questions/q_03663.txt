Answer one of the following. Support your interpretations with specific and relevant evidence   from our readings, lectures, and classroom presentations/discussions (40%). (Remember: the quotes below are here to stir up your thinking, not to be the sole thing you talk about in your essay.  The actual question is in the italicized follow-up to the quotation.) A.  "For he makes me confess that I ought not to live as I do, neglecting the desires of my own soul, and busying myself with the concerns of the Athenians; therefore I hold my ears and tear myself away from him. And he is the only person who ever made me ashamed, which you might think not to be in my nature, and there is no one else who does the same. For I know that I cannot answer him or say that I ought not to do as he bids, but when I leave his presence the love of popularity gets the better of me."                                                                                                                                                                         --Alcibiades, on Socrates (and himself), in Symposium "All politics is local," says the tried-and-true cliche, and what could be more local than the very individual?  Given the course of Greek politics across the Classical Period (Salamis to Chaeronea), but especially in Athenian affairs, how would you describe the balancing act between self-interest and communal benefit, between a demagogue and a supposedly altruistic leader?  Did anyone among Athens' many famous leaders manage to rise above such taints?   B.  "In the Hellenic world...the measure of a free male was most often taken by observing how he fared when tested in public competition against other free males, not by scrutinizing his sexual constitution.  War (and other agonistic contests), not love, served to reveal the inner man, the stuff a free Greek male was made of."                                                                                                                         --David Halperin, "Is There a History of Sexuality?" At first glance, Halperin's statement may seem solidly incontestable, given all the wars that characterized Classical Greece's history.  And yet for all that, we have paradoxes that deserve our attention: Pericles, the lifelong general who sponsored Athens' great peacetime achievements; Socrates the hoplite, renowned for intellectual sparring; Alcibiades who never met a triumph he couldn't turn into a debacle, even Aspasia for a stark contrast.  Supporting your stance with detailed evidence, would you end up agreeing with Halperin or no?    C.  Socrates: If a wife has been well taught by her husband and still does a bad job of managing the household, then perhaps the wife deserves blame. But if he does not teach her properly and should find her ignorant of such things, isn't it right that the husband be held responsible? At any rate, Critobulus, you must tell us the truth (we are all friends here). Is there anyone else to whom you entrust more serious matters than your wife?     Critobolus: No one.    Socrates: Is there anyone with whom you speak less than your wife?    Critobolus: I have to admit, only a few.                                                                                                              --Xenophon, Oeconomicus From our own primary readings, from the analyses and primary documents provided by Roisman, from the cultural overviews we had in the Garland book, from the reviews presented by many of your peers, we have built up a picture of the complicated misogyny of the ancient Greeks.  How would you assess their attitudes towards women, as well as women's capacity to establish their own stories in such a patriarchy?  (HINT: explore the grey areas, not just the easy areas of blatant prejudice; even the example above has some contradictory implications)

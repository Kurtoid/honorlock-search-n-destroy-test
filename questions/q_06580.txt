In our HyFlex class discussion, we completed an exercise where students self-defined their leadership style on the Blake & Mouton Leadership Grid, allowing Dr. S to create a summary of styles across the class on the Grid (blue dots representing each individual style). This exercise showed that your self-defined styles (in aggregate) would most likely replicate what you will see in most corporate settings in the future - in relation to how the class styles were plotted on the Leadership Grid.

The dewlap is a characteristic feature of Anolis lizards and consists of an extendable flap of skin attached to the lizards' throat.  Among Anolis species, the shape, size and color of the dewlap varies greatly.   Both sexual selection and natural selection have been thought to play an important role in the development of the dewlap and may explain the diversity of forms in different Anolis species.  Female Anolis lizards are "choosy" and would tend to pick males with larger dewlaps.  In addition, larger dewlaps are thought to scare predators away.   To investigate the potential interaction of sexual selection and natural selection pressures on Anolis lizards, scientists measured the dewlap size of male Anolis sagrei lizards from multiple islands in the Bahamas.  Some islands were occupied by Leiocephalus carinatus, a predator of the Anolis lizards and on other islands the predator was absent.  Their results are shown below in Figure 1: Figure 1. Plot of male dewlap size on islands where the predator Leiocephalus carinatus lizards are absent or present.  Plots above the x-axis indicate larger dewlap sizes and plots below the x-axis indicate smaller dewlap sizes (figure modified from Vanhooydonck et al. 2009).     QUESTION: How might the dewlaps of Anolis lizards represent interacting pressures between natural selection and sexual selection? Are these pressure conflicting with or reinforcing each other?  Be sure to discuss both sexual selection and natural selection in your answer and explain using the data provided.

You are cell biologist interested in the regulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, whose pathway components are frequently mutated in cancer cells. EGF stimulates the EGF Receptor (EGFR), which is a receptor tyrosine kinase. You compare how skin cells cultured from a healthy skin sample versus those derived from a skin tumor respond to long term stimulation with the EGF ligand. You lyse the cells at the indicated time points, with and without EGF stimulation, and western blot with antibodies reacting with phosphorylated EGFR, pan-EGFR or Actin. From the below figure, in the box provided  please succinctly answer (1-5 sentences each) : A. What is the likely mechanism of regulation of normal EGFR in response to long-term EGF stimulation? B. Propose a hypothesis as to the molecular basis of why the mutant EGFR behaves differently and why this behavior may contribute to the tumorigenesis.

Use the following scenario to answer the following question(s):Water scarcity is a concern to many countries around the world. To people living in the United States, it may not seem like a critical issue, however, parts of the United States experience heavy droughts which leave regions facing water challenges. Much of our water from domestic and agricultural use comes from aquifers and groundwater. You are working with the United Nations on Goal Six of the Sustainability Developmental Goals: to ensure access to water and sanitation for all. As part of your job, you have to know the distribution of water available on Earth. You report that of all of Earth's water, only _____% is available for use by humans.

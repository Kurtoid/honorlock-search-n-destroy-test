The passage below from The Writing Life, by Annie Dillard, is about writing a book.  After reading the passage, using the definitions as needed, write the letters of the inferences which are most logically supported by the details of the passage.                hie you: hurry                                              cache: a place where supplies are hidden To find a honey tree, first catch a bee.  Catch a bee when its legs are heavy with pollen; then it is ready for home.  It is simple enough to catch a bee on a flower: hold a cup or glass above the bee, and when it flies up, cap the cup with a piece of cardboard.  Carry the bee to a nearby open spot--best an elevated one--release it, and watch where it goes. Keep your eyes on it as long as you can see it, and hie youdeg to that last known place.  Wait there until you see another bee; catch it, release it, and watch.  Bee after bee will lead toward the honey tree, until you see the final bee enter the tree.  Thoreau describes this process in his journals.  So a book leads its writer. You may wonder how you start, how you catch the first one.  What do you use for bait? You have no choice.  One bad winter in the Arctic, and not too long ago, an Algonquin woman and her baby were left alone after everyone else in their winter camp had starved..... The woman walked from the camp where everyone had died, and found at a lake a cachedeg. The cache contained one small fishhook.  It was simple to rig a line but she had no bait, and no hope of bait.  The baby cried.  She took a knife and cut a strip from her own thigh. She fished with the worm of her own flesh and caught a jackfish; she fed the child and herself.  Of course she saved the fish gut for bait.  She lived alone at the lake, on fish, until spring, when she walked out again and found people. 11.  The comparison of writing a book to finding a honey tree suggests that writing a book, in the end, is

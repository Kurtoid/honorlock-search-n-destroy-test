Whose Turn Is It? 1 Every day we participate in different forms of interaction. In some interactions, for example, classes, meetings, or political debates, it may seem obvious that there are rules that we all follow. Those rules tell us who speaks when or how you get a turn to speak. It may be more surprising to learn that ordinary conversations also have rules, and the rules can often be interpreted differently by people of different backgrounds. Taking Turns 2 Conversation is organized into turns. There are just two fundamental rules for turns in conversation, and experts in this field say that these are followed fairly consistently across cultures. First, in general, one person speaks at a time, without much overlap. Second, there is very little silence between turns. 3 That sounds simple, but how do people know how to participate in the "conversation game"? During conversation, people send each other subtle signals. The most important signals come from speakers to indicate that they are finishing a turn. There are three categories for these signals. First, speakers may make a visual signal, such as a gesture with their hands or head. Second, the quality of their voice may change. For example, they may begin to speak more softly, more slowly, or with a lower pitch before they stop speaking. All of these are signals that the end of a turn is coming. Finally, and most importantly, is where speakers look. While they are speaking, they usually glance occasionally at their listeners. However, when they are about to finish, they tend to look their listeners directly in the eye. All of these signals help listeners perceive the end of a turn so they can prepare to jump in for their own turn. All of this happens unconsciously, without either person realizing what is happening. 4 What do listeners do while they are waiting for their turn? They have several options. They can signal their attention by looking at the speaker. They can also give what are known as minimal responses, such as "mmm-hmm," or "yeah," which tell the speaker that the other person is paying attention. Listeners who want a turn before the speaker has finished often change the position of their bodies in an effort to get the speakers' attention. Or they may simply start to speak while the other person is still talking. In other words, they may interrupt the speaker. When this happens, the speaker has to decide whether to give up the turn or to try to keep it. One way to maintain the turn is to keep speaking, perhaps at a louder volume, and see if the person who is interrupting will give up. Because the rules of conversation do not permit two people to speak at the same time for very long, eventually one of them will stop speaking. In friendly conversations, people generally try to minimize this competition for turns. Variations in Conversational Style 5 Although the rules of conversation are generally the same everywhere, there are important differences across cultures, ages, classes, and genders. These differences generally fall under two categories: silence and overlap between speakers. For silence, how much is permitted between turns? Regarding overlap, how much is tolerated? In other words, how long can two people speak at the same time? What happens when one person's perception of the rules are somewhat different from another person's? What happens when the person you are talking to does not conform to your style or misinterprets your cues? 6 Consider the following example. Imagine that you are telling two of your friends a story about something that happened to you. They are listening and giving minimal responses, such as "mmm-hmm" and "wow!" You can see that they are interested in your story. Then, one of your friends looks very excited and finishes your sentence at the same time as you are talking. Next, he starts telling his own story before you have finished yours. You are offended because you have been interrupted, but he thinks the two of you are having a great conversation. 7 Scholars who study language use say that your friend is not trying to compete with you. For him, this is a form of conversational cooperation. By finishing your sentence and jumping in with his own story, he is trying to establish a bond with you. He is trying to show how much you have in common. Nevertheless, it is easy to see how breakdowns in conversation can occur and how one person can get the wrong impression. Learning about conversational styles can help you become more tolerant when you are talking to someone whose style is different from yours.

In cucumber, fruit color is controlled by one gene with two alleles, symbolized G and g. There are two traits for fruit color: Green fruits and yellow fruits. A series of crosses were done to determine the relationships between the alleles and between the alleles and fruit color. Cross 1:  Both parents have yellow fruits, and all their offspring have yellow fruits. Cross 2:  Both parents have green fruits, and some of their offspring have green fruits and some have yellow fruits. Cross 3:  The male parent has yellow fruits, the female parent has green fruits, and some of their offspring have yellow fruits and others have green fruits. Use the information above to answer the following questions: What is the dominant phenotype? [phenotype1] What is the genotype of the female parent in cross 2? [genotype1] What is the genotype of the male parent in cross 3? [genotype2] In which cross are BOTH parents homozygous? [cross1]

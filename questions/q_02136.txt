Case Study #5a   Scenario Trudy, 52, was in treatment for cervical cancer. Although she was tolerating the chemotherapy well, she kept getting bladder infections, for which an antibiotic was prescribed. The symptoms would go away, only to return within a week or two. When she arrived at the cancer treatment center for her latest round of chemotherapy, she let the nurse know that she thought the infection was back once again. Signs and Symptoms The nurse asked Trudy to describe her symptoms. She reported having a persistent "full bladder" feeling that didn't go away after voiding, and that she thought she had a fever. The nurse confirmed that Trudy did have a low-grade fever.  Testing The nurse also tested Trudy's urine with a urine dipstick, and sent a sample to the microbiology lab for culture. The dipstick was positive for blood, nitrite, and leukocyte esterase. The lab technologist noted that the urine appeared cloudy, and transferred a small amount to a slide and directly observed it with a microscope. A smear of the urine was Gram stained and then samples were transferred to MacConkey Agar (MAC), Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA), and Blood Agar (BAP) plates for culture. The Gram stain is shown below.    Question: Based on the information provided, which of the following could most likely be responsible for Trudy's signs and symptoms?

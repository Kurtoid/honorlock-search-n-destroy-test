On February 1, Mason (an accounting professor) telephoned Jackson, the purchasing representative for Acme Used Computers.  During the telephone conversation, Mason offered to sell to Acme his used laptop computer for $400.  Jackson advised Mason that he had to talk to his supervisor before he could accept Mason's offer and, therefore, he asked Mason to agree to keep the offer open until February 3.  Mason agreed.  On February 2, Mason received an offer from a friend to purchase the laptop for $450.  He called Jackson and advised him that he was going to sell the computer to his friend and not to Acme.  Jackson immediately told Mason that his supervisor had approved the purchase and that Jackson, on behalf of Acme, was accepting Mason's February 1 offer to sell.  Jackson claims that Mason is obligated to sell the computer to Acme.  Mason thinks he is free to sell it to his friend.  Which of the following statements is correct?

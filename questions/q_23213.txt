At 650 degC, Kp= 0.040  for the following reaction:   W (g) +  3 X (g)   =   2 Z (g) Assume that the initial pressure of W is 0.0500 atm and X is 0.100 atm.  Calculate the equilibrium pressures of compounds W, X, and Z.  You may use your graphing calculator or this website (links to external site) to solve the  quadratic formula, but you must show all work for setting up the quadratic equation properly.

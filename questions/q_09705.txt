The fish fills this version by swimming to the surface, taking gulps of air, and directing them into the swim bladder.  Air is removed from this version by "belching." The physoclistous version is more derived and has lost its connection to the esophagus. Instead, gas enters and leaves the swim bladder via special circulatory mechanisms within the wall of the swim bladder.

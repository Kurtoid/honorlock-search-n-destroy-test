If a hiker climbs a mountain from sea level to 3000 meters, and the temperature at sea level is 34degC, what temperature (in Celsius) will the hiker encounter at 3000 meters? Assume the lapse rate is 8degC / 1000 m. When providing your answer, simply enter the number.
STOP! If you are using a white board, please show me both sides that it is blank (even if you already did this in the room scan).  If you did not show me your computer keyboard and screen using a mirror in the room scan, now is the time to do so. I will look for this when I review your proctoring session. Once you've done this, please write done and proceed. (This is worth 0 points, just serves as a reminder!)

A palindrome is a string that is the same forward and backward. You can use a loop to determine whether a string is a palindrome, and it is also easy to define a palindrome recursively as follows:  A string containing 1 letter is always a palindrome. A string containing 2 or more letters is a palindrome if  Its first and last letters are the same, and The rest of the string (without the first and last letters) is also a palindrome.    Write a java program that prompts for and reads in a string, then print a message saying whether it is a palindrome. Your main method should read the string and call a recursive (static) method palindrome() that takes a string and returns true if the string is a palindrome, false otherwise.   Note: some examples of palindromes are "kayak", "12022021", and "123aba321". In this problem's setting, only numbers and letters are allowed in a palindrome. Your code should be able to handle the exception if the user inputs some other characters such as punctuations or symbols. Any other exception that you can think of must also be elegantly handled in the program.

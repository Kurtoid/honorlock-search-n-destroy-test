Free Response: Below all of the free response questions for this exam are listed. You should work all of the free responses completely before exiting the Canvas quiz. You only need to type your final answer for each question into the essay box below. Once you have closed the quiz, then you can use your cell phone to take pictures of your free response work and then can upload this to the assignment labelled "Free Response Exam 3 Unit 4 Part 2" as a pdf or word document. You will have 10 minutes from the time you finish the Canvas quiz closes to upload. Note that no credit will be given for a free response question without both the answer typed into the box (matching your work) and the work upload. If the quiz times out before you get to type in an answer, e-mail me your final answer (or as far as you got for the question) immediately. The quiz is time stamped, so I will know whether you sent it immediately or took additional time to work on it outside of the Canvas quiz.

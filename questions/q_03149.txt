You are the CEO of a hotel chain and you want to analyze the factors that affect the profit margin (measured in 10,000s of dollars) of the different hotel locations. A sample of 30 hotel locations were used to perform the following multiple regression analysis. Use a level of significance of 5%. Y = PROFIT = profit of the hotel (in 10,000s of dollars)ROOMS10 = number of competing rooms within a 3 mile radius (in 10s of rooms)POOL= 1 if the hotel has a pool and 0 otherwiseNO POOL = 1 if the hotel does not have a pool and 0 otherwise (NO POOL is OMITTED category)OFFICE1000 = Amount of office space in the surrounding area (in 1000s of square feet)ENROLL1000 = College and university enrollment in the area (in 1000s of students)INC1000 = household income in the area (in 1000s of dollars)DIST = distance from the hotel to the downtown area (in miles) Minitab gave the following output:    Predictor            Coef    SE Coef       T       P   Constant            30.33      13.22    2.29   0.031   Rooms10          -0.00481    0.03702   -0.13   0.898   Pool                3.135      5.177    0.61   0.551   Office1000       0.024207   0.008368            0.008   Enroll1000         0.7042     0.2897    2.43   0.023   Inc1000           -0.1690     0.3315   -0.51   0.615   Dist              -0.1519     0.3495   -0.43   0.668    What is the alternative hypothesis for the test of the slope/coefficient on "OFFICE1000"?

Suppose you want to find the reaction enthalpy, DHrxn for the reaction,    X2 + O2  --> 2XO         DHrxn = ???  kJ where X is an imaginary element, by adding some combination of the reactions below.  You are not going to actually add the enthalpies for these reactions, but rather determine the multiplier for each reaction that will make them add to the reaction above.  If you use a reactions as written enter a "1"; if you need twice a reaction then enter a "2"; if you need to reverse a reaction, enter "-1".  If you do not use a reaction, enter a "0", etc. The only accepted answers are "0,  1/2, -1/2, 1, -1, 2, or -2". Enter one of these answers in each blank corresponding to each reaction in order. 1)  X2 + 2O2 --> 2XO2                       DH = 50 2)  2XO + O2 -->  2XO2                    DH = -100 3)  XO2  + X2   -->  X2O + XO         DH = -50

Part 1: Which of the following statements is correct in describing the terms monohybrid cross and dihybrid cross? A. A monohybrid cross involves a single parent, whereas a dihybrid cross involves two parents. B. A dihybrid cross involves organisms that are heterozygous for two characters that are being studied, and a monohybrid cross involves organisms that are heterozygous for only one character being studied. C. A monohybrid cross is performed for one generation, whereas a dihybrid cross is performed for two generations. D. A monohybrid cross results in a 9:3:3:1 ratio, whereas a dihybrid cross gives a 3:1 ratio.   Part 2 (Extra Credit +2) : In a dihybrid cross between the P generation a homozygous dominate pea plant (YYRR) with a homozygous recessive pea plant (yyrr) what would be the phenotypic ratio for the F2 offspring?

An entrepreneur purchased a boutique by taking out a $200,000 mortgage. After a year, she sold the boutique to a businesswoman. According to the terms of the agreement signed by the parties, the businesswoman took the boutique "subject to the mortgage" and agreed to "assume payment of" the mortgage. Shortly thereafter, a popular shopping center opened in the same town and the businesswoman found herself in financial trouble with the boutique.

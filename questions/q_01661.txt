Project: LIFE Design  a 7-segment decoder that determines two-bit logical input (using the switches on the BASYS 3 trainer board), and generates output on the 7-segment display as shown in the following table:    S1 S0 7-segment Display   0 0     0 1     1 0     1 1        If both switches are OFF, the 7-segment has to display capital letter 'L'. If the switch S0 is ON and S1 is OFF, the 7-segment has to display capital letter 'I'. If the switch S0 is OFF and S1 is ON, the 7-segment has to display capital letter 'F'. If both switches are ON, the 7-segment has to display capital letter 'E'.  To achieve this, you have to derive the Boolean expression for each segment of the 7-segment display: a, b, c, d, e, f, and g by using the method of your choice (Karnaugh map, minterm or maxterm).  The 7-segment display on BASYS 3 board is active low, meaning...  logical output 0 will turn ON the LED of that segment,  logical output 1 will turn OFF the LED of that segment,  For example,    7-segment Display a b c d e f g    0 0 0 0 0 0 0    1 0 0 1 1 1 1    0 0 0 0 1 0 0    Directions:  Complete the truth table in question 1. Derive the Boolean expression for each segment and answer question 2. Implement your design on BASYS 3 Board using Xilinx Vivado with VHDL language. Provide your design code (.vhd) and constraints code (.xdc) in question 3 and 4, respectively. Take photos of your result and embed them to question 5.

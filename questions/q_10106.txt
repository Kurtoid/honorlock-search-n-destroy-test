Fraud Investigation Case Part 2 Based on your entire investigation, you believe Jason Teagard is the single perpetrator of the fraud. You decide to conduct an admission-seeking interview with him for purposes of obtaining a written confession. You tell Teagard that the interview is for the purpose of reviewing "routine security issues in his department." Teagard agrees to the interview and suggests that it be held in his office for convenience as he has a very busy schedule that day. At the scheduled time, you and NNS's corporate attorney arrive at Teagard's office. The attorney obtains Teagard's permission to lock the door to ensure there will be no interruptions. The shade on Teagard's office window is left open to provide more light. Teagard is seated at his desk, and you and the attorney take seats on the opposite side with the office door behind you. You begin by asking Teagard some introductory questions; however, he quickly he becomes aware that he is under suspicion of fraud. At this point, Teagard stops and says that he wants to speak to an attorney. The corporate attorney says "Don't worry, that's why I'm here." Questioning then resumes. At one point, Teagard says he needs to leave to get a drink of water. The attorney says, "Just sit tight. We'll get you some water." You quickly retrieve a bottle of water from the break room and bring it back to the office. Part 2 Question 1: Was the interview setting arranged properly? Explain. Part 2 Question 2: Discuss the issues surrounding Teagard's request for a lawyer and the corporate attorney's response. Part 2 Question 3: What other aspects of the interview should have been done differently, if any?

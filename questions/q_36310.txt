Memory Management (Note: K = 1024), Working Set 2. (6 points, 3 minutes) (a) (3 points) An engineer proposes hardware support for LC-2200 processor to aid memory management that uses a pair of "bounds" register to define the memory occupied by a process. The registers are used thusly by the memory manager:  A process P1 is currently running occupying memory from 4000 to 5000 (i.e., the lower bound register would be set to 4000 and the upper bound register would be set to 5000, when P1 is running). P1 makes a blocking I/O call and is swapped out. Later when its I/O is complete and it is ready to run, the memory manager brings P1 into memory from 2000 to 3000.  What is wrong with this situation?     (b) (3 points) How can the "base" plus "limit" register mechanism for memory management be used to avert the problem in the earlier question?

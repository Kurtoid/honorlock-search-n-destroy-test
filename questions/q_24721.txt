A Community Center was interested in the effect of their program on summer loss. Summer loss is the decrease in academic knowledge from the summer to the Fall of the new year. To test their program they drew a random sample of 20 students from the program.  The students were assessed before and after the 6 week program on a 36 item assessment.  Difference scores  were calculated for the 20 students and are summarized below. (These scores were calculated by subtracting the pre test from the post test score. Each box in the chart below is a difference score for one of the 20 students. For example, the first student's difference score is 2, the second student's  difference score is 0, the third student's difference score is 6.   Difference Scores on Assessment Pre-Post Program (N=20)    At  .01 significance level, do the results support the effectiveness of the program slowing summer loss? Create a 90 % confidence interval. How does the confidence interval support your decision?

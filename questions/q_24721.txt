You are doing research in a cancer biology lab and you have access to the following experimental techniques/tools to perform your studies: (i) Tissue culture facilities with capacity to look at cell growth characteristics. (ii) Mice that can be used to perform a subcutaneous xenograft. (iii) A system to image fluorescence in live animals. (iv) An X-ray machine. (v) Equipment to fix, section and stain tissue and a microscope to view the stained tissue sections. (vi) Equipment to perform orthotopic transplants into mouse brains. (vii) Facilities to generate and culture organoids. Pick which technique would be the most appropriate (i.e. cheapest, fastest and easiest) in the following situations.

You decide the cells are cancer cells so now you want to determine if they are sensitive to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin You have genetically engineered tumor cells and you now wish to determine if they can cross the blood brain barrier to form a brain tumor. During the genetic engineering you make a mutation in the gene of interest and you also added an GFP marker gene to allow you to track the cells.  You have developed a mouse model for lung cancer and you now wish to use biomarkers to determine how closely it resembles non-small cell lung cancer in humans

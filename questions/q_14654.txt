Have opinions on the amount of money being spent on solving the problems of the big cities changed in recent years?  According to the General Social Survey, 544 out of 1149 Americans in 2014 (group 1) think that too little is being spent on solving the problems of the big cities compared with 573 out of 1059 Americans in 2018 (group 2).  You are going to construct a 95% confidence interval for the parameter.   a. Which of the following are the necessary assumptions for a 95% confidence interval for comparing two independent proportions? I. Quantitative data in both groups II. Categorical data in both groups III. Independent random samples IV. The sample sizes n1= 1149 and n2 = 1059 are both at least 30 V. Successes and failures in group 1 and group 2 are 544, 605, 573, 486 respectively and are all at least 15. For credit, you must choose all of the assumptions that apply. [1]   b. The 95% confidence interval is (-0.11, -0.03).  Complete the interpretation. We are 95% confident that the true proportion of Americans who think that too little is being spent on the problems of the big cities in 2014 is between __________________ than in 2018. [2]   c. The z test statistic was calculated using the pooled proportion.  What is the value of the pooled proportion for this significance test? [3]

13.  Below are several representations of messenger RNA.  Rather than type out nitrogenous base sequences, I am representing sequences with the words Intron and Exon to indicate whether that particular segment of mRNA is an intron or an exon.

Suppose a firm has a monopoly over the sale of smartwatches in the U.S. The inverse demand for smartwatches in Florida is given by P1(q1) = 170 - 2q1, and the inverse demand in New York is given by P2(q2) = 280 - 5q2, where q1 and q2 are the total output of smartwatches sold in Florida and New York, respectively. The demand for smartwatches in each market is observable to the monopolist. The firm has a constant marginal cost of $50 and zero fixed costs. What is the profit-maximizing price charged to consumers in the Florida market?
1. A Rankine steam plant operates with a closed feedwater heater (CFWH).  Steam exits the boiler at 600degC and 20.0 bar.  The steam exits the High Pressure turbine at 5.0 bar.  Some of the steam is extracted and goes to the CFWH. the rest of the steam goes to the Low Pressure turbine.  The extracted steam preheats the feedwater, then is throttled into the condenser.  The steam exits the Low Pressure turbine at the condenser pressure of 0.70 bar.  The pump is ideal, the turbines have an efficiency of 85%. The table provides some of the properties that you will need. You DON'T need to fill in EVERY blank in the table.         b. What is the specific heat transfer to the boiler (kJ/kg)?

3.2   Lees deur die uittreksel hieronder en beantwoord die vrae wat volg: See pampoentjies (sea urchins) stel hulle gamete vry in omgewings so klein soos 'n rotspoel of so groot soos die oseaan self. Onmiddellik nadat gamete vrygestel is, wag daar twee uitdagings wat oorkom moet word voordat bevrugting kan plaasvind: 1) die onwaarskynlikheid dat sperms en eierselle in die water by mekaar sal uitkom, en 2) om te verhoed dat die spermselle ander spesies se eiers, wat ook in die water is, bevrug. Die groot getalle volwasse seepampoentjies en die geweldige hoeveelheid spermselle en eierselle wat deur alle volwasse pampoentjies geproduseer word, is een strategie om die kanse vir bevrugting te vergroot. Baie ander spesies het 'n verdere strategie wat behels dat die eiersel chemikalie afskei wat die spermselle na die eiersel toe lok. Dit beteken dat die spermselle slegs eierselle van dieselfde spesie sal bevrug. Nadat bevrugting plaasgevind het, ontwikkel die sigoot in 'n larwe wat kan swem en op alge voed.

1 For behold, in those days and at that time I will bring back the captives of Judah and Jerusalem.2 And I will gather all the nations and I will bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat [note: "Jehoshaphat" = "Yahweh Judges"] and I will deal with them in judgment there in behalf of My people and My inheritance Israel whom they have scattered among the nations;      And they divided My land 3 and they cast lots for My people     And they traded a boy for a whore, and they sold a girl for wine to drink 4 And also, what are you to me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the territories of Philistia? Are you indeed paying Me back? But if you are paying Me back, I will swiftly, yes, quickly return your payback on your head.5 Since you have taken My silver and My gold, and you have brought My precious treasures to your palaces,6 and you have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the children of the Ionians in order to bring them far from their territory,7 I am now stirring them up from the place where you sold them, and I will return your payback on your head.8 And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a distant nation, for Yahweh has spoken. 9 Proclaim this among the nations: Consecrate yourselves for war    Arouse the warriors, let them come near, let them go up, all the men of war10 Hammer your plowshares into swords and your pruning knives into spears    The weak should say, I am a warrior!11 Come and lend help, all surrounding nations, and gather there    O Yahweh, bring down your warriors12 Let the nations be aroused and go up to the valley of Jehoshaphat    For there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations13 Send forth the sickle, for the harvest is ripe    Go, tread, for the wine press is full    The wine vats overflow, for their wicked deeds are many14 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of judgment!    For the Day of Yahweh is near in the valley of judgment15 The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars lose their brightness16 And Yahweh roars from Zion, and He gives His voice from Jerusalem    And the heavens and the earth will shake    And Yahweh is a refuge for His people, and a place of safety for the sons of Israel17 And you will know that I, Yahweh your God, dwell on Zion My holy mountain    And Jerusalem will be holy, and oppressors will not again pass through her

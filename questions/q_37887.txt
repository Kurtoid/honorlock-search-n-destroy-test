For example, you only had to press a key once to launch your fly bot, and it kept flying forever. The code below uses if statements to make a fish sprite move in different directions.  var fish = createSprite(200, 200);fish.setAnimation("fishR");fish.velocityX = 2; function draw() {background("blue"); // if fish reaches left edge, fish moves right.if (fish.x < 0) {fish.setAnimation("fishR");fish.velocityX = 2;}// if fish reaches right edge, fish swims left.if (fish.x > 400) {fish.setAnimation("fishL");fish.velocityX = -2;}drawSprites();}  Do This  Look at if statements that check the sprite's position and set its velocity.

Calculate the following pH, [OH-], and/or [H3O+ ] given the following information below. Place all numbers for [H3O+] and [OH-]in proper scientific notation. The scientific notation is broken down by significant digits (first box) and exponents ( x 10^) in separate boxes. Remember the rule for significant figures and logarithms. They will be enforced on this problem (i.e. - if your answer is correct but significant figures are wrong, you may only get partial credit which will be awarded after the instructor reviews your answer).    A pH = 3.350 [H3O+]= [A] x 10^[B] [OH-] = [C] x 10^[D]   B pH = 7.6231 [H3O+]= [E]  x 10^[F] [OH-] = [G] x 10^[H]   C pH = 9.91 [H3O+]= [I] x 10^[J] [OH-] =  [K] x 10^[L]   D pH = [M] [H3O+] =  5.234 x 10-4 pOH =  [N]   E pH = [O] [H3O+] =  5.4 x 10-8 pOH =  [P]   F pH = [Q] [H3O+] =  4 x 10-12 pOH =  [R]

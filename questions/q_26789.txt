(15-18) A production manager wants to determine how many units of each product to produce weekly to maximize weekly profits.  Production requirements for the products are shown in the following table.     Product   Material 1 (lbs.)   Material 2 (lbs.)   Labor (hours)     A   3   2   4     B   1   4   2     C   5   none   3.5     Material 1 costs $7 a pound, material 2 costs $5 a pound, and labor costs $15 per hour.  Product A sells for $101 a unit, product B sells for $67 a unit, and product C sells for $97.50 a unit.  Each week there are 300 pounds of material 1; 400 pounds of material 2; and 200 hours of labor.  The output of product A should not be more than one-half of the total number of units produced. Moreover, there is a standing order of 10 units of product C each week (customers made the payment already).

Body color of wiggly worms is determined by the alleles B and b.        B = brown   b = tan A first generation population of wiggly worms living in the forest consists of 26 homozygous dominant (BB) brown worms, 46 heterozygous brown worms (Bb) and 28 tan worms (bb). After the population was counted for the first time, the forest was destroyed but the population of worms survived.  The sixth generation of worms consisted of 5 homozygous dominant brown worms, 32 heterozygous worms and 63 tan worms. For the next six generations the land stayed barren.  The twelfth generation of worms consisted of 4 homozygous dominant worms, 36 heterozygous worms and 62 tan worms.   Fill in the chart for the data you collected.

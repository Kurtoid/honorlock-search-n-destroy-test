Draw the BEST Lewis structure for the following skeletal structure (not all the lone electrons or multiple bonds are shown).  Count the number of valence electrons that should be in the picture.  Use formal charges to prove that this is the BEST Lewis structure.  Show all work on any Lewis structure that you draw.            Draw the structure(s) and formal charges on the scratch sheet and tell me how many double bonds are in the BEST structure in the text box.  Your answer can be zero or none.

Suppose you observe the price of the following bonds today (t=0). Assume that the face value of each bond is $100 and coupons are paid semiannually.  Bond A: 6-month zero coupon bond priced at $96.70 Bond B: 1-year bond with 4.00% coupon priced at $97.90 Bond C: 1.5-year bond with 8.00% coupon priced at $102.20   (a) Compute the discount curve Z(0,T) for T = 6 month, 1-year, and 1.5-year.   Z(0,0.5) = [answer1]  Z(0,1) = [answer2]  Z(0,1.5) = [answer3]   (b) Once you get the discount curve Z(0,T), you take another look at the data and find the following 1-year bonds Bond D: 1-year bond with 8.00% coupon priced at $101.72 Bond E: 1-year bond with 10.00% coupon priced at $106.12 Compute the fair values for these bonds with the discounts you found.  Are the fair values the same as the market (traded) prices above? Bond D: [answer4] Bond E: [answer5]   (c) Is there an arbitrage opportunity in part (b)? If there is an arbitrage opportunity, describe how you can take advantage of it. Assume that Bond A and B are correctly priced and you can buy and short any fraction of those bonds.  (Step 1) You [answer6] [answer7]-units of Bond A (Step 2) You [answer8] [answer9]-units of Bond B (Step 3) You [answer10] 1-unit of Bond [answer11]

VRAAG 7 Die diagram hieronder wys 'n massastuk wat vasgemaak is met tou aan die bopunte van twee pale (PQ en PS), sodat die massastuk in equilibrium is. Die onderskeidelike kragte vanaf punt P (T1) en R (T2) na die massastuk is 8N en 5N. Die hoek tussen T1 en die vertikale as is 35o en die hoek tussen T2 en RS is 55o . Regterklik op die onderstaande blou blokkie om die diagram in 'n nuwe venster oop te maak.       7.1    Definieer die term Resultante krag.   (2)     7.2   Verteenwoordig AL die kragte (insluitende die hoeke) wat op die massastuk inwerk met behulp van 'n vektor diagram.   (4)     7.3   Bepaal die massa van die massastuk.

Tara produces color cartridges for inkjet printers. Suppose cartridges are sold to mail-order distributors for $12 each and that manufacturing and other costs are as follows:     Variable Cost per Unit       Fixed Cost Per Month             Direct material   $4.00   Factory overhead   $17,000     Direct labor   0.40   Selling and administrative   8,000     Factory overhead   0.50             Distribution   0.10             Total   $5.00   Total   $25,000     The variable distribution costs are for transportation to mail-order distributors. Also assume the current monthly production and sales volume is 20,000 and monthly capacity is 25,000 units.If the sales price per unit increases by $2.00 and unit sales decrease by 2,000 units, Tara's monthly profit would:

Map Reduce A map-reduce application consists of:   50 shards of data to be processed  5 distinct outputs to be produced  CPU time to execute a map function: Tm  CPU time to execute a reduce function:  Tr I/O time to write an intermediate result by a mapper: Ti   Synchronous RPC time to fetch an intermediate result by a reducer: Trpc   I/O time to write out the final result by the reducer:  Tf  The map-reduce infrastructure uses 10 threads for the map function and 5 threads for the reduce function. Ignoring scheduling overheads by the infrastructure, compute the total execution time for the above application.  (Show your work for partial credit)
The Anderson Spinlock paper points out that there are three key metrics to analyze the performance of spinlock implementations: latency, delay and contention. Use the above terms complete the following sentences:  Test_and_test_and_set (or spin on read) has better [A] than the queuing lock. Test_and_test_and_set has worst [B]. Under light loads, static delay algorithms have worse [C] than dynamic delay algorithms. The queuing lock has better [D] than the delay-based locks.
OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT For the following hypothetical credit approval/credit card process, there are 4 tasks as shown in the process diagram below:  Details of staffing levels and productivity levels for each step is as follows: TASK 1: 6 operators currently assigned; 4 more available if required; processing capability of 40 customers/hour/operator; and maximum overtime of 4 hours/operator/day available if required. TASK 2A: maximum processing capacity of 750 customers per hour.  External input and thus capability is fixed. TASK 2B: 3 analysts currently assigned; 3 more available if required; and each analyst can process 100 customers per hour (analysts will only work 40 hours a week).  TASK 3: 2 operators currently assigned; 1 more available if required; processing capability of 120 customers per operator per hour; and maximum overtime of 4 hours/operator/day available if required.    It is safe to assume that regular time available per week per operator is 40 hours.  Based on this information, you are required to answer the following questions:

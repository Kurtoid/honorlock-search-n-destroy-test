Exam 4: Case Study Sherri             Sherri is a 25 year old, married, white female who recently gave birth to her first child.  Her friends and husband report odd behavior right after the birth of Troy, now 7 months old. Sherri's husband shares with the psychiatrist at the hospital the changes he has observed in Sherri. Sherri used to be a gym rat, playing tennis with her friends and doing water aerobics and yoga throughout the pregnancy. She no longer feels motivated to be involved in these activities. She also seems to avoid her friends, not even texting or returning phone calls. She also no longer attends social events with her husband as she used to. Even though she no longer exercises, she has lost significant weight.             Her husband finds her to be neglectful of Troy, refusing to feed or bathe him. She will not even play with him. Sherri seems annoyed and highly irritable towards Troy. Sherri was excited for Troy's birth and spent much time shopping for baby clothes and decorating the nursery during her pregnancy, but even days after his birth, Sherri did not seem that interested in Troy and has stated that "this is overwhelming" and "I am not a good mom." Sherri is often tearful, but unable to explain why she is upset. She complains of feeling empty and worthless. Her husband had to hire a nanny to care for Troy because of Sherri's inattention to the baby. This has caused much stress within the marriage. When Sherri came in for treatment her symptoms seem to have changed in the past 8 days or so. She reported that she felt little need for sleep, and that she could not stop her thoughts from racing through her head. She spoke quickly, sometimes not making sense. According to her husband, her attention easily drifts now whereas before she was engaging, conversational, and friendly. She could not sit still during the interview and seemed restless and began pacing the room. Sherri's husband felt that something was seriously wrong and brought her to the hospital for an evaluation. The psychiatrist's recommendation was to admit her for treatment.   Exam 4: Case Study Sherri (10 points)   _________________________________             (your name) Read and reread the case study.

An instructional resources company claims to have a method to train students which will increase their scores on any standardized test. Concerned that their admission process would be adversely affected, a large university decides to test this claim. The registrar selects, using a method which is independent and random, a group of n =150 high school students. This group is randomly divided in two, n1=75 students are sent to be trained to increase their test scores and n2=75 students are shown an inspirational movie to act as a control group.             After training both groups are administered an old I.Q. test, the following results are obtained Ms1=107 and Ms2=102. To interpret the results the following assumptions are made:     a. The distribution of the scores before training was normal N (100, 15)     Any changes due to training represent a change in the location of the mean                          rather the shape of the distribution, hence s1 = s2 = 15 Test Ho: u1 = u2 vs. Ha: u1 > u2  at the a =.05 level of significance. The following triple (z-score, p-value, Your Conclusion) is produced when the data is properly input in to your calculator

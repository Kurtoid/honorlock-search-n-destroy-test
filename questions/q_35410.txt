Question 3 - 6 points A) Using model1, calculate the Cook's distance of the points in the dataset and create a plot for the Cook's Distances.  B) Identify the row number of the observation with the highest Cook's distance.  C) Remove this observation from the abalone dataset. Call this new dataset abalone2 and create a new multiple linear regression model, called model2, using all predictors with Rings as the response. Display the summary table of this model. Discuss differences between the models with and without the outlier. Would you classify this observation as influential?

A runner maintains constant acceleration after starting from rest as she runs a distance of 60.0 m. The runner's speed at the end of the 60.0 m is 9.00 m/s. How much time did it take the runner to complete the 60.0 m distance?
The squared part (semi-partial) correlation is usually smaller than the squared partial correlation when regression an Y on X. Both correlations consider how much of Y's variance is explained by a independent variable X. Why is the squared part correlation usually smaller.

When summer squash with white disk-shaped fruit are crossed with a variety that has yellow spherical fruit, the second generation plants will produce one of these four types of fruit: white disk-shaped, white spherical, yellow disk-shaped, or yellow spherical.  If the true genetic model is dihybrid cross, these types will appear in the ratio 9:3:3:1.  An experiment yielded the following numbers of each variety.

COMPETITION  Figure 8 is an illustration of the distribution of two species of barnacles (Species BB and Species CS) that grow in the intertidal zone of the ocean. Intertidal zones are the zone of highest and lowest tides. Question 4. You find the following results: When grown together Species BB grows better than Species CS in the middle- and lower intertidal zones, while Species CS grows better than Species BB in the high intertidal zone. What would you conclude about the cause of zonation? Explain in one sentence.
A magician reaches into one of three hats, A, B, and C, and pulls out either a rabbit or a gecko. The tree below shows the probability that hat A, B, or C is selected and the conditional probabilities for selecting either a rabbit or a gecko from each hat.    What are the following probabilities: P(Rabbit) [R]     The probability that the magician selects a rabbit. P(B) [B]                     The probability the the magician chooses from hat B P(Rabbit|A) [RA]        The probability that the magician selects a rabbit given that he has chosen hat A P(B

Problem 3 (20 points). A company has a software for an asymmetric encryption scheme  that is known to be IND-CCA secure under some reasonable assumptions. But the message space for this scheme is only the set of messages up to 1MB long.  At some point they needed to encrypt messages of length more than 1MB but less than 2MB. So they decide to use the existing software in the following way. To encrypt a message , break it into equal parts  (for simplicity let's assume that all messages have even length) and let a ciphertext be computed as , for any . Here || denotes concatenation. The new decryption algorithm outputs , where  are two halves of the input ciphertext, if neither base decryption algorithm rejects. If either base decryption algorithm rejects, then the new decryption algorithm rejects. Let's call the modified scheme . The company hired a cryptography consultant to assess security, and she said that  is IND-CCA assuming  is IND-CCA and justified her statement with the following. "For any efficient IND-CCA adversary  attacking  we construct an efficient IND-CCA adversary  attacking : Adversary

Read the poem (used for all poetry questions) and answer the question that follows. My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130) By: William Shakespeare My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red; If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damasked, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound; I grant I never saw a goddess go; My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.      And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare      As any she belied with false compare.   What type of poem is this?

During the 2006 season, the home team won 136 of the 240 regular season National Football League games. Is this strong evidence of a home field advantage (i.e. more than 50% of wins occur at home) in professional football?  Use a=0.01. Calculate the test-statistic and determine the p-value for this test. The test-statistic is [stat] and the p-value is [pval]. Report test statistic to 2 decimal places and the p-value to 4 decimal places.

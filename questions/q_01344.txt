Then read the instructions in the question which follows and write an appropriate code sample. Consider the following main method which calls SwapMinMax.  SwapMinMax has one parameter, an array of a generic type.  It take in the array and swap the smallest and largest elements in the array.  It returns true if the smallest and largest elements are different and false otherwise. public static void main(String[] args){     Integer[] intArray = {9, 234, 38, 14, 12, 1, 20};     String[] strArray = {"strings", "are", "not", "sorted", "here"};     Integer[] testArray = {5, 5, 5, 5, 5};    if (SwapMinMax(intArray)){         for (Integer i : intArray){             System.out.print(i + " ");         }         System.out.println();     }     if (SwapMinMax(strArray)){         for (String s : strArray){             System.out.print(s + " ");         }         System.out.println();         }     if (SwapMinMax(testArray)){         for (Integer i : intArray){             System.out.print(i + " ");         }         System.out.println();     } } The output of this main method is: 9 1 38 14 12 234 20are strings not sorted here

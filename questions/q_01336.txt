Review the paragraph and answer the question below. Aerobic Exercise vs. Strength Training There are two major types of exercise--aerobic exercise and strength training--and each has distinct benefits. Aerobic exercise includes activities such as running, biking, and swimming. When people do aerobic exercise, they breathe hard and their hearts beat fast. It also increases their endurance. Strength training involves lifting, pushing, or pulling something, usually something heavy. Pushing one's body up from the floor using one's arms, as happens when performing a push-up, is an example of this kind of exercise. Strength training burns fat and builds muscles. Which kind of exercise is better? This is a difficult question to answer. Aerobic exercise burns energy faster, so it might help a person lose more weight. Research has shown an additional benefit of this kind of exercise: It can reduce stress. On the other hand, when more of the body is muscle, the body burns more energy, so strength training can help with weight loss as well. In addition, strength training exercise makes bones stronger. Finally, this form of exercise gives muscles an attractive shape, so it may make a person look better. Both types of exercise have benefits and can help people live longer, healthier lives. For the best physical health possible, people should include a combination of both in their weekly exercise program.  What is the controlling idea of the topic sentence?

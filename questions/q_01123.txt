Fabiano and colleagues (2010) aimed to enhance the academic outcomes of students with ADHD in special education settings by using a Daily Report Card (DRC). Children with ADHD in special education placements were randomly assigned to a DRC intervention condition or a control condition. A measure of academic achievement was collected at baseline and again at the end of the study.  The researchers assessed whether children in the DRC group had higher post-intervention academic achievement than those in the control group, after controlling for baseline academic achievement.  a) What is one testable research question that addresses the aim(s) of this study? b) What analysis should be conducted to test the above research question? c) Which variables should be included in the above-mentioned analysis (be specific)?

In early spring of 2003, an outbreak of untypical pneumonia first appeared in southern China. To determine the etiological agent, you inoculated a throat-swab specimen from patients on cultured cells. You then examined the infected cells with an electron microscope. You found various ultra-structures: some display characteristics of Coronaviruses and the others look similar to Chlamydia. Please design an experiment to confirm whether these agents are present. Describe the technique/method in detail. (2 points) How would the response to antibiotics treatment help you to determine the cause of the outbreak ? (1 point) Because this appeared to be an emerging infectious disease, it is important to track down the original source of infections. One hypothesis is that some animals may harbor the same or similar viruses. What can you do to test this hypothesis (1 point)?

Assume that the noise exposures for the worker in Question 11 were all measured at twice the distances at which the worker normally stands from the machines. What are the actual exposure levels for the worker? A. Assume that the measured dB levels are equivalent to dBA and the durations of exposure to each machine are as follows: Machine A = 5 hrs.; Machine B = 2 hrs.; Machine C = 1 hr. B. What is the accumulated noise dose for the worker?  C. Given the calculated dosage, what is the 8-hr. time-weighted average (TWA) exposure for the worker? D. Does the calculated TWA exceed the OSHA maximum permissible limit for an 8-hour workday?

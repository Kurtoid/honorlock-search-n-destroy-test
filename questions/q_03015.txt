I understand learning is not something that can be passively acquired. Learn is an action word. Learning is best facilitated through a collaborative and participative partnership between the student(s) and the professor. Once the professor has provided the necessary resources, instructions and directions, the student primarily determines student-learning outcomes. The professor is available for consultation and clarification to support successful learning outcomes throughout the duration of the course. Students are encouraged to contact the instructor via PHSC email for questions and clarifications. Under discussions, we have created a student to student section that is not faculty monitored. We have also created a student to faculty discussion section. If you have a question, then other students probably have the same question. The faculty will respond to these discussion posts within 48 hours. If you have not received a response to your email within 48 hours, Monday through Friday, please feel free to email or call again.

Describe TWO similarities and TWO differences between the light microscope and the electron microscope.
Virus infections induce production of interferons that act on infected cells to enhance their recognition by CD8 cytotoxic T cells. To counter these mechanisms, viruses often encode proteins that interfere with antigen processing and presentation. In an experiment, cells infected with Virus X are treated with interferon alpha and compared with uninfected cells treated with interferon. Proteosomes are isolated from the two cell populations and their enzymatic activities are compared. The data in the below figure show the amino acid preferences for cleavage of peptides by the two samples of Proteosomes. Uninfected cells with no interferon display a pattern similar to the Virus + interferon condition (not shown).  Based on these data, Virus X most likely encodes a protein that interferes with what immunological mechanism? (1-3 sentences maximum).

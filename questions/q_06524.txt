Choose any four out of the following six short answer prompts, and write your responses in the provided space. Each question is worth 25 points. You will not get more points by answering more than four of these prompts. Write a paragraph of appropriate length for each answer and incorporate relevant scientific processes and terminology. 1.) Based on what you have learned this semester, should ecological rehabilitation of the Everglades be continued despite to the high likelihood of sea level rise submerging this region by the end of this century? Support your answer with relevant facts. 2.) Discuss the concept of biochemical oxygen demand and oxygen sag in lotic ecosystems. 3.) Assisted migration is a climate change adaptation and conservation strategy with the aim of helping non-mobile species adjust their ranges by capturing individuals from their southern range margin and releasing them further north (in the northern hemisphere). Briefly describe the scientific rationale for this strategy, and state your opinion whether it should be used routinely, in exceptional circumstances only (specify/explain), or never. 4.) Define the terms "capacity factor" and "energy return on energy invested" (EROI), and list one example each for a technology with (a) a low capacity factor, (b) a high capacity factor, (c) a high EROI, and (d) a low EROI. Be specific. 5.) Explain one environmental and one human health consequence of frequent or chronic exposure to high levels of fine particulate air pollution. 6.) Explain a concept of your choosing that you learned about in EVS3000 that you found most surprising, i.e. you either didn't know about it before, or you were surprised by the details of how the process or issue works.

Monetta, Inc, has no debt, but is considering borrowing for the first time to finance a three-year project. The company currently has an unlevered cost of capital of 12 percent and a 30 percent tax rate. The project requires an initial investment of $1.2 million, which will be straight-line depreciated over the three-year project life. The project, which is as risky as the firm's current projects, is expected to generate earnings before depreciation of $600,000 per year for the three years.

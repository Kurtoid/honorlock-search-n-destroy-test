A stormwater collection system is designed for a system reliability of 0.85 over its 15-year lifetime. Should the annual maximum drainage collected by the system be 2-parameter exponential distributed with a mean 1.2 million gallons per day (MGD) and a coefficient of variation of 0.42, compute:  the system capacity to achieve the desired 15-year system reliability of 0.85. the expected number of system failures over its 15-year lifetime. the safety factor and margin of safety of the system. the 100-year annual maximum drainage collected by the system.
Elaine is an analyst at the Bureau of Economic Analysis and she is in charge of determining U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Elaine has evaluated all applicable transactions that occurred within the U.S. for the first quarter, except for four transactions. Prior to these four transactions, Elaine has GDP at $100. The four transactions are as follows:  Orange Farms produces three jars of its Blossom Honey, valued at $10 per jar. Orange Farms sells two of its three jars of Blossom Honey to General Mills. General Mills uses these two jars of Blossom Honey to produce twenty boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios, valued at $2 per box. General Mills sells ten of these twenty boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios to Publix Supermarkets. Publix Supermarkets sells all ten boxes in its stores at a price of $4 per box.  If Elaine calculates GDP correctly, then what will be her value of U.S. GDP for the first quarter?
Caroline is the manager of the customer service department at a major metropolitan newspaper. The department is fairly small, so she and the other CSRs know each other well and are a fairly close-knit group. Lately, however, she has noticed that the most recent hire in the department, Amanda, gets quiet and somewhat aloof whenever Caroline is around. Caroline decides to set up a private face-to-face meeting with Amanda. She starts by calmly explaining that she called the meeting because she senses that Amanda is unhappy about something and that she seems unhappy when Caroline is around. She encourages Amanda to share her thoughts and provide feedback on the way the department operates and her responsibilities as a CSR. Amanda responds by accusing Caroline of having "favorites" in the department and that being the new kid on the block, she is not included in the group. She doesn't feel like her work is getting the same recognition as that of the other CSRs. Which of the following responses would be the most diplomatic way for Caroline to disagree with Amanda?

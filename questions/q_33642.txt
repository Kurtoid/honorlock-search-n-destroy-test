In the pancreatic b cells, glucokinase (similar to liver enzyme, high Km, high Vmax) participates in the b cells functioning as a glucose sensor (these cells respond to high blood glucose levels by releasing insulin). Glucose, imported into the b cells by the GLUT2 transporter, is metabolized through the glycolytic pathway to produce ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. The ATP produced binds to an ATP-dependent K+ channel leading to depolarization of the b cells and insulin release. If the b cell glucokinase is similar to the liver glucokinase, which of the following characteristics of glucokinase will also contribute to glucose sensing by the b cells?

(True/False)     D2A conversion is faster than successive A2D conversion. (True/False)     Storing time information in integer variables (e.g., uint32 and uint64) is preferable to storing time information in variables of type float in embedded systems (True/False)     Technology scaling has led to a decrease in dynamic power dissipation, but an increase in leakage power dissipation. (True/False)     In NoCs, the buffer requirements in routers for wormhole switching are the same as for virtual cut through switching but less than store and forward switching. (True/False)     CMOS digital camera sensors have a higher signal/noise ratio (SNR) compared to CCD digital camera sensors. (True/False)     For an array stored in column major order, the best performance (when using a set of nested loops to access the array) occurs for the case when the innermost loop corresponds to the rightmost array index. (True/False)     DVFS can save more energy for workloads with high arithmetic (compute) intensity than workloads with high memory intensity (True/False)     Packet switching in NoCs is preferable to circuit switching for applications with hard real time requirements (True/False)

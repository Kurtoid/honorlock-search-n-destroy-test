16-19) Use the text below to answer questions 16-19.  Jonah is a neurologist. He has a new patient who suffered a significant brain injury while skiing.  Jonah has the patient undergo several detailed brain scans to identify the part of the brain that was damaged. Jonah also has the patient perform a large number of behavioral tests including a line cancellation test and several drawing tests. In the line cancellation test, the patient successfully crosses out all the lines on the right side of the paper, but none of the lines on the left side of the paper. And when the patient is asked to draw a cartoon face, the patient draws only the right side of the face (see examples below). The patient consistently acts as if he is unaware of the left-hand side of the world. However, if Jonah points out objects on the left-hand side of the world, the patient notices and can clearly see them.  Jonah takes all of his results - including the results of the brain scans and behavioral tasks - and publishes them in a peer-reviewed journal.    16) What type of study has Jonah conducted?

Instructions for Final Alice 3.0 Program - After creating an Alice program to do the following instructions, upload the *.a3p file here.     Create a new Alice 3.1 program that will have the following objects in an underwater scene:  A big shark 5 small fish (assorted)    Make the shark move around with your arrow keys as follows:  Up arrow - move forward Down arrow - move backward Right arrow - turn right "a little" Left arrow - turn left "a little" Letters "A" - go up; "D" go down   A camera marker in another scene underwater, where a biped is found. Make an array to hold the 5 small fish, create a fishBobbing method that will have a loop that repeats 60 times or until the time runs out, or until all 5 fish are caught. In the fishBobbing method, all the fish move together up and down, as if they were bobbing in the water. Call the fishBobbing method from myFirstMethod. Add a 3-D text object for the score, and initialize it to 0. Add a 3-D text object for the timer, and initialize it to 60. Create a timerCountDown method that will decrease the timer by 1 for each second (use wait). Call the timerCountDown method from myFirstMethod, together with the fishBobbing method.  Create a collision event between the shark and the array of fish  If the shark collides with any fish, without pressing space bar Then the fish disappears & goes deep down into the sea And the score goes up by 1.    When the timer is down to 0, check the score with an if-statement.  Make camera go to a new location, with any biped underwater If score is >= 3 -a biped will say "Pretty good, you ate a lot of fish!" If score is < 3 --a biped will say "Sorry, you must still be hungry!"   Extra Credit #1 Add music playing in parallel to the timerCountDown method. Extra Credit #2: Create another camera marker for an Intro scene to the game. State the rules of the game, then move camera to game scene. Extra Credit #3: End game when score reaches 5, not just when time runs out. Extra Credit #4:  Add anything creative to game.    Rubric:

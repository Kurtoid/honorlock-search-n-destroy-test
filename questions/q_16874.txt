Suppose that the six-month interest rate is 3.8% per annum in the U.S. and 6.8% per annum in France, and that the current spot exchange rate is $1.05/EUR and the six-month forward exchange rate is $1.04/EUR. You can borrow/invest at most $1,000,000 or the equivalent euro amount, i.e., EUR952,381. Design an arbitrage trading strategy using the concept of covered interest arbitrage. How would you start implementing the arbitrage trading strategy? Would your first transaction be to borrow in USD (and then invest in the other currency) or to invest in USD (and to borrow in the other currency)? Assume you are a dollar based investor. Hint 1: Assume that interest rates are quoted as Annual Percentage Rates (APRs), which means that you need to divide the rate by two to calculate the interest rate for half a year. Hint 2: We know from covered Interest Rate Parity (IRP) that: FUSD/EUR / SUSD/EUR = (1+rUSD) / (1+rEUR)

Refer to the following Case Study which pertains to unintended consequences of an Arizona state law. Case Study: The goal of an immigration law in the state of Arizona, SB1070 (2010), was to discourage illegal immigration by making it a crime under state law, and directing law enforcement to check immigration status for anyone legally stopped if there was "reasonable suspicion" of illegal status. In addition, it authorized arrest without warrant if the officer had "probable cause" to believe that an offense had been committed, and resulted in the removal of a non-citizen. Most experts believe that this law resulted in a significant decline in the illegal immigrant population in Arizona. If the construction industry in Arizona is growing and projects that it will need 40,000 new workers within the next 18 months, which of the following unintended consequences of SB1070 might occur in Arizona?

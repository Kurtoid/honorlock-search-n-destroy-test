Suppose we fit a VAR model to two time series called AG: USD valuation of Silver Ounce and M2: Overall supply of (mostly-)liquid currency supply (Billions)), both of which you will see on part 2 of this exam. Assume order selection yielded lag = 2 and you applied Wald test (significance level = 0.05) using all lagged variables of M2 in the equation of AG and again using all lagged variables of AG in the equation of M2; that is, the unrestricted VAR(2) model. Given the following R-output from the Wald test, you can say about Granger causality? Output 1:    Output 2:

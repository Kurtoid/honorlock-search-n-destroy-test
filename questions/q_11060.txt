Question 1.1: Assume that GM's production possibilities frontier (PPF) is the following:  Suppose that the relative price of components was  in the U.S. in the absence of offshoring. Suppose now that GM has the option to offshore some of its production to other countries and that component production is relatively cheaper in the rest of the world so that< Which of the following options shows correctly how offshoring affects GM's own production of components and R&D?  a)b)  c)d)
For the global circulation diagram below, indicate the cell, pressure belt, or wind system associated with each number (a couple numbers may have a couple different possible choices). Type out the entire name. NOTE: You will see this map for four (4) questions in a row. For each question, you only need to identify ONE (1) circulation cell, pressure belt or wind system - you do NOT need to identify them for all ten numbers. The number for which this question is asking is in RED just above the map and just below these instructions. Each is worth 0.5 points. It is designed this way so that Canvas can select four random numbers for each student, and you can still see the map for each question. You do NOT have to read these instructions again for each question; they are the same for each, so please do not waste your exam time re-reading them unless you need to.   For this question, identify a circulation cell, pressure belt, or wind system at location 5.

1) Calculate the pressure due to the ocean at 11000 km depth, assuming the density of seawater (1025 kg/m3) is constant all the way down. (5 points)   2) To help prevent frost damage, 5.00 kg of 0oC water is sprayed onto a fruit tree. How much heat transfer occurs as the water freezes? (5 points) specific heat capacity of water = 4186  J/kgoC Latent heat of vaporization of water = 2.26 x 106 J/kg Latent heat of fusion of ice = 334 x 103 J/kg   3)  a) At what net rate does heat radiate from a 475 m2 black roof on a night when the roof's temperature is 32.0 oC and the surrounding temperature is 20.0 oC? The emissivity e of the roof is 0.900 and Stefan-Boltzmann constant 5.67x10-8 J/s [?] m2 [?] K4 (5 points) b) What is the direction of heat transfer in the above case? How do you know the direction?

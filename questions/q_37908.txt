The airport has 5 screening stations available, and the facility manager must decide how many to have open at any particular time. The hourly cost of opening each station is $20. The average service time for processing passengers at each screening station is 20 seconds per passenger. On Monday morning, the arrival rate is 0.095 passengers per second.

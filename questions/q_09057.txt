A time study is conducted on a process that has three (3) separate operations. The process involves five (5) masons placing 1 cubic yard of concrete for each cycle. Ten cycles of each operation are carried out.  The results of the study are as follows: Operation                              Total time (seconds) for 10 cycles or repetitions  # 1                                           975 # 2                                           643 # 3                                           917   The observer assigns the following factors: Allowance = 14%, Rating = 125 % a.) Determine a standard time in minutes per cycle for the entire process and record the values for the following:                                  Select time PER CYCLE :__________________ Normal time (seconds)=_______________________ Standard time (in minutes) =__________________________  b.) Using the standard time for the crew of 5 masons, calculate the work productivity as cubic yards per mason hour of material, OR mason hours per cubic yard.

If a specimen of granite were slowly heated, which mineral would melt first
A group of anole lizards lives on a tropical island that has a variety of vegetation. Some individuals underwent natural selection for short legs that allow them to climb on slender vines and twigs. Other individuals underwent natural selection for longer legs with large toe pads that allow them to climb up slick leaves, high in the canopy of the forest. There was no advantage to having legs of medium length or medium sized toe pads. Eventually, the group that climbs on vines and the group that climbs on leaves became two different species of anole lizards. This is an example of...

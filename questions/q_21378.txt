Read the description of Daniela's semester, then answer the following question in Spanish. (5 x 1 = 5pts) Daniela es mi companera de cuarto. Este semestre ella estudia cinco cursos. Los lunes, miercoles y viernes toma clases de administracion de empresas, contabilidad y sociologia. Los martes y jueves toma clases de geografia e historia. Daniela camina de la residencia estudiantil a la universidad y cena en la cafeteria de la universidad porque sus clases terminan a las nueve de la noche. Los fines de semana (weekends) ella trabaja en la biblioteca. Le gusta bailar y escuchar la radio a  e  i   o   u   E  ?  n   ! ?Que pasa los sabados y domingos?
In the context of compilation in the presence of Scratch-pad memory (SPM), please answer the following two questions. a) Assume that a given program will not fit in the SPM but if we partition the program in small blocks, some of the blocks can be placed in SPM. Assume, each block i has size si. Using profiling it is possible to compute the gain gi of placing the block i in the SPM instead of placing it in the regular memory. We want to find which of the blocks can be placed in SPM that maximizes the overall gain. The SPM has size S. Furthermore, due to routing constraints up to N blocks can be stored in the SPM. Formulate this as an integer programming problem. Assume, variable xi is 1 if the block i is mapped to the SPM, 0 otherwise. No need to create perfect equations for cost function and constraints as long as it is understandable. For example, the summation of n instances of xi can be shown as:  SUM_1^n (x_i) or  SUM1n (xi). b) Consider a specific instance where a program has three blocks (b1, b2, b3) and the gain (by placing each block in SPM) for the respective blocks are 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The size of the three blocks (b1, b2, b3) are 1, 2, 3 units, respectively. The capacity (size) of the SPM is 3 units. Due to routing constraints up to 2 blocks can be placed in SPM. Show all the solutions (use * to mark feasible ones) and identify the best solution in terms of maximum savings using X. The "Size" column indicates the size required to map the tasks (marked by '1' in the left three columns) to SPM. The "Gain" column indicates the overall gain by mapping the respective tasks to SPM. In the left three columns, '1' means that block has been mapped to SPM ('0' means not mapped to SPM). Please fill in the entries (no explanation required). If you cannot create a table like the following one, please use spaces/tabs as well as newlines so that rows and columns are clear.    b1 b2 b3 Size Gain  Feasible Best   0 0 0       0 0 1       0 1 0       0 1 1       1 0 0       1 0 1       1 1 0       1 1 1

Billy wants to test whether the average speed of his favorite pitcher's fastball differs from the league average of 92 miles per hour. He takes a sample of 36 of the pitcher's fastballs and computes a sample mean of 94 miles per hour. Assume that the standard deviation of the population is 4 miles per hour.  At the 5% significance level, can you conclude that Billy's favorite pitcher's fastball differs in speed from the league average?

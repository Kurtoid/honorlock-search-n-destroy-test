You were to watch a production of Hamlet. Answer the follow question in a developed, thought paragraph each.  Use your textbook to find the location of the soliloquy you choose and to revisit the names of the characters.   List what production you watch, naming the actors, the year produced, and where you found the production (library, etc.). Then discuss your personal reactions to the play. Discuss the main characters in the play and how their characteristics and personalities contribute to the plot, the climax, and the resolution of the play.  Then discuss Shakespeare's writing -- he's known to use both poetry and prose in the dialogues of his plays, and he's known for the dramatic soliloquy as a method of conveying information and dramatic effect to his audiences. Select one soliloquy that especially moved or struck you as important. Be sure to note the speaker, a paraphrase of the speech, about where in the play it fell, and whether Shakespeare used poetry or prose for the speech.   This answer should be three paragraphs long, with a paragraph for each of the parts of the question. (30 points)

The diagram below shows an object, an image, and the location of an optical component, which is either a mirror or a lens. You will need to determine what that optical component needs to be and its magnification in the given scenario.         I recommend the following procedure, answering each part of the question in order:   Look at the position of the object and the image and the nature of the image (real or virtual). That should be enough to tell you whether the optical component is a mirror or a lens. Which one is it? [1] Now, taking into consideration the sign conventions for a lens or a mirror, whichever you are working with, use the distances to find the focal length of the optical component. What is the focal length? [4] Now consider the focal length. Is the optical component converging or diverging? [1] What is the magnification in this scenario? [3]

50) Posh Pillows manufactures two products, pillows and cushions, from a joint process. Pillows are allocated $7500 of the total joint costs of $25,000. There are 2500 pillows produced and 2500 cushions produced each year. Pillows can be sold at the split-off point for $10 per unit, or they can be processed further into a deluxe pillow for additional processing costs of $8400 and sold for $19 for each deluxe pillow. If the pillows are processed further and made into deluxe pillows, the effect on operating income would be

Write a C++ function that takes as an input a singly linked list pointed to by head and returns a pointer to a  new singly linked list: Node* dual_linked_list(Node *head); In this function you should create a new singly linked list that consists of nodes containing the values of every other node of the input list. Also, the new list uses a special link, called cross, to point to the input node with the same value, see the illustration:   The crossed circles are NULL/nullptr. Here is the definition of Node: struct Node {   int elem;   Node *next;   Node *cross;   Node(int e) : elem(e), next(nullptr), cross(nullptr) {}}; Provide the cost of building the above dual linked list in the terms of Big-O asymptotic notation.  Which operation/s will benefit by the above dual linked list and why?

The nurse is providing preoperative teaching to a client scheduled for surgery. The nurse is instructing the client on the use of deep breathing, coughing, and the use of incentive spirometry when the client states, "I don't know why you're focusing on my breathing. My surgery is on my hip, not my chest." What rationale for these instructions should the nurse provide?

Answer BOTH of the following questions. Make sure to label each answer to match the corresponding question using number and letter (I-A, I-B). Suggested time: 45 minutes.  I-A.   Descriptive statistics for student final exam scores in a class (N=24) have a mean of 16.3, and a standard deviation of 4.2.  Give the 90% confidence interval for the mean. 1-B.  In a study of psychotherapy treatment methods for mild depression, three treatment groups are compared.  One group of patients receives a form of interpersonal therapy (IPT), a second group gets "pharmacotherapy" (management of the depression with drugs), and a third group gets a combination of IPT and pharmacotherapy.  Patients are evaluated for seriousness of their depression when they enroll in treatment, using the Ham-D scale (a score of >13 indicates depression).   The outcome variable is Ham-D score after 16 weeks of psychotherapy, although scores on the Beck Depression Inventory are also taken at the 16-week mark. The researchers analyzed these data using a mixed-model ANOVA, a repeated-measures design, with factors Group and Time (with levels 1 = week 0, 2 = week 16).  The Group factor has three levels: IPT (interpersonal therapy), DR (pharmacotherapy or treatment with drugs), and IPD (combine IPT and drug management).  SPSS output from this analysis is shown on the following pages. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores at week 16 are recorded in variable BDI16. SPSS Output.pdf   The researchers have the following research questions. RQ1:  Do the three types of therapy differ in their effectiveness? RQ2a: Which therapy treatment works best?   RQ2b: Is that type of therapy effective in decreasing depression scores? For each research question above, write a short paragraph giving your answer to the question. Support your conclusions with statistical evidence, taken or computed from the SPSS output on the next page.  Try to use APA format for presenting this statistical evidence.  Note that for questions RQ1 and RQ2b you should be reporting and discussing inferential tests.   If the researchers want to answer RQ1 and RQ2 using the Beck Depression Inventory scores at week 16 (variable Beck16) as the outcome instead of Ham-D scores, what statistical technique or design would be best? For RQ1, what specific test results would you look at to obtain an inferential test of the question? For RQ2, what specific test results would you look at to obtain an inferential test of the question(s)?

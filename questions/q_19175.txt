Coding Problem:  A teacher has 10 students in her class and she has 10 individual average grades (between 0 and 100). The provided incomplete program is part of a program that asks the teacher to enter in each average one at a time. The program should then calculates the total number of As, Bs, Cs, Ds and Fs and gives each of these numbers and ALSO creates a horizontal bar chart (using asterisks (*) ) of the distribution of these (see below for sample run). See the partially complete program: here Begin by downloading that file. I have provided the main function, the function declarations, and the implementation for one of the four functions.  You need to provide the other three function implementations.  For important clues about how to do this be sure to examine the function header comments and the function calls in the main() function. IMPORTANT: partial credit is available.  I will grade each individual function separately. A sample run: Please enter each grade, one at a time:55657874739591839989 Number of As: 3Number of Bs: 2Number of Cs: 3Number of Ds: 1Number of Fs: 1A: * * *B: * *C: * * *D: *F: * Submit your single working complete .cpp file that contains both the main and the functions you wrote.

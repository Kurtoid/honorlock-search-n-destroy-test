2. Compute the recharge (q in mm) onto an agricultural field deeper soil layer due to deep percolation (passed the crop root zone) of irrigation water. Is the water recharge (q) from irrigation enough to keep a good balance of salts in the soil? If not, how much water in excess of "q" should be added to have an adequate drainage or leaching of salts from the crop root zone? The irrigation system is a drip system with a known application efficiency of 95%. The crop evapotranspiration rate (ET) during the period of maximum demand is 6.5 mm/d. The drip evaporation losses are 0.5% of the gross irrigation water depth. The irrigation frequency is 2 days during this period. There is no surface runoff. Rainfall is not likely during this period. The crop is strawberry, the acceptable yield reduction due to potential soil salinity is 0% (consider the root zone profile varied soil water salt concentration when calculating the electrical conductivity of the drainage water). The water electrical conductivity is 0.81 dS/m.

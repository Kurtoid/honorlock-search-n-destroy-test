SECTION 3-B - Analysis (30 minutes)In order to better promote the health and safety of its citizens, the city of Tormance decides to take one of its six public parks - Swaylone Park - and redesignates it as a "citizen health center." Swaylone Park was the most recently-opened park in Tormance, having opened only 6 years earlier (on a space that had previous served as a city medical center). The city repurposes it as the "Swaylone Public Health Area" because, the City Council says in a statement, "the five other public parks in existence are sufficient to meet the city's need for open space, recreation, and places to meet for gatherings of various kinds - and there is a need for a space where the city can offer vaccinations, blood donation drives, free medical check-ups, various 'drive-through' health services, trainings and health classes (as well as classes in self-defense and protecting security), and other services to assure citizens are safe, strong, and feel their needs are being protected." On 25% of the space that was Swaylone Park, the city builds a new office building - with medical specialists and other staff - to help administer and provide the health services in its health center. The remaining 75% of the new Swaylone Health Area space has an appearance and form almost identical to that which it had as Swaylone Public park, but with more numerous seating and covered areas for individuals to use while they are receiving the various health services offered. There is also a new road built through part of this space to facilitate the provision of drive-through health services.  The city states that city residents' access to the Swaylone Health Area will depend on what services the city is deciding to provide. It says that the outdoor area of the Swaylone Health Area will generally remain open to city residents for any activities "not inconsistent with the area's primary function," but that on certain days or times, it "may close this outdoor area to everyone except individuals coming for certain services, such as a vaccination or blood donation drive." Four months after the city reopens this former park to the public as a health center, it begins reserving the outdoor part of the Center - two days each week - for what it calls "Mental Health & Tranquility Activities." It does so after receiving numerous complaints from city residents that "non-stop protesting, political proselytizing and advocacy, and disruptive forms of artistic expression are making it difficult for citizens to find refuge in any public spaces from conflict and rancor." The city invites city residents who "feel they need a peaceful environment for psychological health" to come to the outdoor space in the Swaylone Health Center two days each week - for organized meditation classes or any activity they wish to carry out "in a calm environment to reduce tension and anxiety."  During these some of these Mental Health & Tranquility Days, certain groups of individuals enter the outdoor grounds on the Swaylone Heath Center to (1) distribute literature to other individuals warning about the possible negative effects  they believe might result from certain vaccinations and other medical services offered by the city, (2) speak (often passionately) to city residents about these issues, and then (3) gather together and hold protests against various aspects of the city's policies.  city officials have these protesters removed from the outdoor portion of the Swaylone Center, stating that the protesters' activities are "inconsistent with the Center's ability to serve city residents' physical and psychological health."  The City says it has nothing against the protestors' views, but that their "harassment of other individuals wishing to obtain health services is not something the city can tolerate." Please write an essay analyzing the arguments that the protestors and the City are likely to make about (1) what kind of space or "forum" the outdoor grounds of the Swaylone Center are, and (2) briefly describe what test a court would apply to the City's ban on these protestors' activities in (a) a public forum and (b) a non-public forum and what facts would inform each of these analyses.

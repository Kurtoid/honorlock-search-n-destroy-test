PREDATION  Question 6. Suppose that stoat and vole populations are governed by Lotka-Volterra predation dynamics. The population growth rate of the vole is 0.5, the stoat capture efficiency is 0.01, the mortality rate of stoats is 0.001, and the efficiency with which voles are converted to stoat offspring is 0.01. A survey of the population estimates the initial population size is 200 stoats and 100 voles. A. Where does the vole isocline cross the y-axis (the number)? B. Where does the stoat isocline cross the x-axis (the number)?

15) The lockdowns and closings that have occurred over the past year due to the COVID-19 pandemic have greatly reduced the number of possible activities that we can choose to engage in. There were many activities that we would have liked to engage in, but we just couldn't. For instance, at many points over the past year I would have liked to go to a restaurant or bar, an art museum, or a sporting event, but those simply weren't available options.  Based on self-determination theory, these are examples of the way in which the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced our:
Please use the following information to answer the following questions.You work for a company selling tropical rain forest plants commonly found in the understory of the forest. These plants are shade tolerant and can be grown indoors because they require low light. Your employer wants you to find out what is the best type of light to maximize growth of these understory plants. Using a full spectrum of natural light would cause these plants to die because they are a shade-tolerant plant species.From your biology class, you recall that the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis involve pigment molecules that absorb light of specific wavelengths. You also remember the experiments done by the German biologist Theodor Engelmann, in which he separated light using a prism into different wavelengths and then determined which wavelengths were best for promoting photosynthesis in the algae species he was examining. Your goal is to determine which wavelengths (colors) of light are best for promoting photosynthesis to enhance growth in your species of plant. To achieve this, you grew your plants under different wavelengths of light and measured their growth rates. The wavelengths were measured in nanometers (nm), and the growth rate was measured in millimeters per day (mm/day). The data you collected are as follows:WavelengthsGrowth400 nm0.33 mm/day450 nm0.46 mm/day500 nm0.88 mm/day550 nm0.12 mm/day600 nm0.54 mm/day650 nm0.28 mm/day700 nm0.08 mm/day750 nm0.00 mm/dayMake a bar graph plotting growth rates on the y-axis and wavelengths of light on the x-axis. Referring to your graph, answer the following questions:Some plant species require shaded conditions while other plant species require bright sunlight. Shade tolerance is best related to which of these characteristics?

Strong push by Dental Professionals to increase use of "enamel" strengthening toothpastes, similar to Colgate's Total Care and other brands that offer specific enamel strengthening properties.   Q1:  Identify the (5) correct comparative observations based on the data set & narrative for Colgate's Toothpaste Products. (15pts)  A) Colgate's TOTAL product has the highest gross margin % of all product segments shown coupled to their worst market share position.   B) Colgate's SENSITIVE product is significantly lower in market share than any of the other product segments yet it is one of the fastest growing market segments.   C) Colgate's TOTAL product has very low gross sales $ that is most likely the result of it's very small market size and market share.   D) Colgate's WHITENING product ranks #1 in both the most gross margin $ and best gross margin %.  E) Colgate's SENSITIVE product has very low gross sales $ that is most likely the result of it's very small market size and market share.   F) A strong push by dental professionals to increase use of "enamel" strengthening toothpastes will boost Colgate's SENSITIVE product sales.   G) Colgate's OPTIC WHITE product is a small but fast growing market with a significantly high Colgate market share position.  H) Colgate's SENSITIVE product has the highest gross margin % of all product segments shown coupled to their worst market share position.

From the Proceedings of the Committee of Correspondence in New York, July 19, 1774:   First. RESOLVED, That his most sacred Majesty GEORGE the Third, King of Great-Britain, is our liege, lawful and rightful Sovereign, and that it is our indispensible Duty to the utmost of our Power, by all constitutional Means to maintain and support his Crown and Dignity. That it is our greatest Happiness and Glory to have been born British Subjects; and, that we wish nothing more ardently than to live and die as such. That we are one People, connected by the strongest Ties of Affection, Duty, and Interest, and that we lament as the greatest Misfortune, every Occurence which has the least Tendency to alienate or disturb that mutual Harmony and Confidence. . . .  Seventh. RESOLVED, That nothing less than dire Necessity can justify, or ought to induce the Colonies to unite in any Measure that might materially injure our Brethren the Manufacturers, Traders, and Merchants in Great-Britain: But that the Preservation of our inestimable Rights and Liberties, as enjoyed and exercised, and handed down to us by our Ancestors, ought to supercede all other Considerations; and that therefore we doubt not the cool, dispassionate People of England, whose Friendship on former Occasions we have experienced, will, on mature Consideration, not only applaud our Motives, but co-operate with us in all constitutional Measures, for carrying these our virtuous Resolutions into execution, in order to obtain the desired and just Redress of our Grievances. Eighth. RESOLVED, That if a Non-Importation Agreement of Goods from Great-Britain should be adopted by the Congress, it ought to be very general and faithfully adhered to; and that a Non-Importation partially observed, like the last, would answer no good Purpose; but on the contrary, only serve to expose all the Colonies to further Injuries.

Assume we have a MIPS machine that uses the speculative version of Tomasulo's algorithm. You should make the following assumptions about the machine. First, the latencies of the execution step for this machine are: (a) FP addition and subtraction execute in 3 cycles(b) FP multiplication executes in 5 cycles(c) FP division executes in 10 cycles(d) integer operations and address addition execute in 1 cycle Also, there are 2 FP adders (for FP adds and FP subtracts), 1 FP multiplier (for FP multiplies and FP divides), 1 address adder, and 1 integer ALU unit. Finally, the reorder buffer can contain at most 5 elements. Fill in the table below indicating the cycles in which each instruction performs each step using the approach that was described in class.  I suggest you cut and paste the table below into your answer before filling in the table entries.

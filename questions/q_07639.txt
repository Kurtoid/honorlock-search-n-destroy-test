Questions 1-9 refer to the following Case 1:  This patient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a history of a gradually progressive hearing loss in both ears, over the last 15 years.  He states that he has difficulty hearing, especially in groups and that he understands better when people speak more slowly.  This is the first complete hearing evaluation he has ever received.  Consider his history and the audiometric data below, and then answer the following questions about this case:           250 Hz     500 Hz     1000 Hz     2000 Hz     3000 Hz     4000 Hz     8000 Hz       Right Ear   Air Conduction     30 dB HL     35dB HL     40dB HL     55 dB HL     70 dB HL     70 dB HL     70 dB HL       Left Ear   Air Conduction      30 dB HL     30 dB HL     40 dB HL     55 dB HL     65 dB HL     70 dB HL     70 dB HL       Unmasked   Bone Conduction     25 dB HL     35 dB HL     35 dB HL     55 dB HL     65 dB HL     70 dB HL     ----------              Otoscopy     Tympanograms     SRT     WRS       Right Ear     Non- impacted cerumen both ears     Type A both ears     45     76%       Left Ear     45     72%         Question 7: This patient's hearing evaluation results were obtained using:

Which of the following is not one of the three general research-based approaches to the work aimed at slowing or reversing aging?
Find the current for R2 of the circuit below.  You must perform a delta-to-wye or wye-to-delta conversion on a portion of this circuit. You must determine which portion to convert.  Complete the following steps to show your work.  It is required to organize your work clearly.  A.) State which resistors you have selected, and which type of conversion you are going to perform. B.) Enter your calculations for the conversion, using the "Insert Math Equation" tool.  C.) Write an explanation of all the resistor relationships in the new circuit.   For example, R1 is in parallel with R2.  That combination is in series with R3.  The following combination is in parallel with R4...etc.  D.) Calculate the total resistance of the new circuit.  Each step of your calculation must be shown. E.) Find the current for R2 of the original circuit.   Your work, including all calculations, must be typed into the answer box below.   Use the "Insert Math Equation" function.  Answers without an adequate explanation or work/calculations will receive little to no points.

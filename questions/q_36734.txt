[FRQ3 PART (B) - The information below was copied and pasted from Part (A)] On January 1, 2021, Blue Snow, Inc. leases a delivery truck from Branch Motors for 4 years. At the time of the lease, the truck has a value of $40,000 in Branch Motors' accounting books and could have been sold for $45,114 at its fair market value. Four equal lease payments are to be made on January 1 of 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. The truck has a 5-year economic life. At the end of the four-year lease term (that is, on January 1, 2025) the truck is expected to be worth $15,000, but this amount is not guaranteed. The truck has been delivered and ready for use by Blue Snow at the beginning of the lease term. For Branch Motors, collectability of the lease payments is probable. Both companies use straight-line depreciation for their long-term assets and end their fiscal year on 12/31. The rate implicit in the lease is 10% and is known by Blue Snow, Inc.

Five dialysis bags, constructed of a type of membrane that is permeable to water and impermeable to sucrose, were filled with various concentrations of sucrose and then placed in separate beakers containing an initial concentration of 0.6 M sucrose solution. At 10-minute intervals, the bags were weighed, and the percent change in mass of each bag was graphed. Osmosis bag.pngWhich line or lines in the graph represent(s) bags that contain a solution that is still hypertonic to the solution in the beaker at 50 minutes?

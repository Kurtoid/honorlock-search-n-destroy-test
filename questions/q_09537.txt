The neurotransmitter epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is involved in regulating visceral functions (e.g., respiration) and plays an important role in the fight-or-flight response in many animals. Consider the structure of N-protonated epinephrine (shown below) and answer the following questions.  The lowest-energy conformation of N-protonated epinephrine is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and the ammonium group. Which of the following Newman projections (A-F) represents this conformation viewed through the C1-C2 bond? [conformation]   Recall that dihedral angles are measured clockwise when answering the next two questions. Consider the conformation of N-protonated epinephrine in which the aryl (Ar) substituent and the ammonium group are eclipsed. What is the dihedral angle between hydroxyl group and ammonium group in this conformation? [dihedral1] What is the dihedral angle between the aryl (Ar) substituent and the ammonium group in Newman structure B? [dihedral2] Do Newman structures A and C represent conformational isomers? [isomers]

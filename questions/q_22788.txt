The European corn borer is an insect whose larvae eat corn crops, thus reducing the yield of the crops. Scientists have genetically modified corn in the hopes of making it more resistant to infestation by the European corn borer. Design an experiment to test whether the genetically modified variety is more resistant to infestation than an unmodified variety. State your hypothesis, and identify your experimental group and your control.

Please use the following case to answer questions #57-60: In the same farm described for questions 52-56, you evaluate a 10-day-old bull calf of 30 Kg of body weight with diarrhea of 1-day duration. This calf has not received any treatment by the owner. At physical exam the calf is in sternal recumbency, lethargic, suckle reflex is absent, eyeball recession (enophthalmos) is > 4 mm, he has scleral injection, mucous membranes are injected and CRT is > 3 sec. The calf does not stand after stimulation. Rectal temperature is 104.5F, HR is 160 and RR is 46.  Question 59: Calculate the total amount of fluids (L), determine the best route of fluid therapy administration (PO, IV or SQ), and calculate total (mEq) of bicarbonate this calf needs during the first 24 hours of treatment. Please use previous DH and BD estimates to make calculations and select your answer.
Read the selection and answer the question that follows.  ...The man flung a look back along the way he had come. The Yukon lay a mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet of snow. It was all pure white, rolling in gentle undulations where the ice jams of the freeze-up had formed. North and south, as far as the eye could see, it was unbroken white, save for a dark hairline that curved and twisted from around the spruce-covered island to the south, and that curved and twisted away into the north, where it disappeared behind another spruce-covered island. This dark hairline was the trail--the main trail--that led south five hundred miles to the Chilcoot Pass, Dyea, and salt water; and that led north seventy miles to Dawson, and still on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and finally to St. Michael, on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a thousand more.      But all this--the mysterious, far-reaching hairline trail, the absence of sun from the sky, the tremendous cold, and the strangeness and weirdness of it all--made no impression on the man. It was not because he was long used to it. He was a newcomer in the land, a chechaquo, and this was his first winter. The trouble with him was that he was without imagination. He was quick and alert in the things of life, but only in the things, and not in the significance. Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty-odd degrees of frost. Such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon man's frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man's place in the universe. Fifty degrees below zero stood for a bite of frost that hurt and that must be guarded against by the use of mittens, ear flaps, warm moccasins, and thick socks. Fifty degrees below zero was to him just precisely fifty degrees below zero. That there should be anything more to it than that was a thought that never entered his head...--from "To Build a Fire" by Jack London, in Kennedy and Gioia, Literature, p. 115A detail that indicated the pattern of organization is

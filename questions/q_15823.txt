A lawyer has represented a single elderly man, Client, in his business affairs. Client has only one living relative, Sister, with whom he has a friendly relationship. Client also has a close friend, Doc, who happens to be Client's physician. During the past year, the lawyer begins to notice a significant change in Client's mental capacity. Client has failed to fill out required state forms on taxation and workers' compensation. Lawyer has reminded Client about these obligations and Client seems to say, "OK, I will remember next time."  It is the lawyer's reasonable relief that Client can no longer act in his best interests. And, the lawyer reasonably believes that Client is likely to suffer substantial financial injury due to the inattention to the tax and workers' compensation forms. There are no ongoing matters for Client that would be affected by the possible disclosure of Client's condition. Thus, lawyer first contacted Sister and asked her whether Client had suffered some health problems. Sister said she did not know of any problems. Attorney then decided to ask Doc about Client's condition. Doc told the attorney that no specific medical changes had been noticed in the last year. Attorney decided not to pursue this any further. Was Attorney's conduct in compliance with the Model Rules?

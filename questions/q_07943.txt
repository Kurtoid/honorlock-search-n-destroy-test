The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is known to lay its eggs in rotting fruits.  The larvae (or maggots) will feed on the fruit while they grow and develop.  The fruit fly is also a very important organism in biological research.  By studying this organism, scientists have identified genes and patters of expression that are important in embryonic development. 1. The fruit fly is a [stome]. 2. The  fruit fly is a [blast]. 3. In terms of body cavity, a fruit fly is [coelom].

Q8. You have isolated a new mutation in fruit flies that you have named dizzy. You suspect the mutation is in a gene that is autosomal and that the dizzy phenotype is recessive.  You cross flies from a true-breeding dizzy strain to flies from a true-breeding wild type strain.  In the F2 generation you count 245 wild type and 90 dizzy flies.  What kind of statistic would you use to test your hypothesis that the dizzy phenotype has a typical Mendelian recessive mode of inheritance?

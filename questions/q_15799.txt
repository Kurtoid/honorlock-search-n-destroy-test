In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Shands Hospital at UF has decided to expand its hospital room capacity with an additional 72 upgraded patient care rooms to the main building. Rooms are approximately 500 square feet (sq ft) in size and are expected to cost $600/sq ft fully equipped at buildout. During construction, the plan is for 4,000 sq ft (space equivalent to 8 rooms) to be completed (on average) each month for 9 months. The estimated cost of the entire project is $21,600,000. You are the University of Florida construction PM responsible for managing the design-build contractor for the new addition. The table below represents the status of your project at the end of Month 5 as reported to you by the contractor; you have verified the report against project progress and believe it to be accurate: Answer the following questions and show your work! 1. What is the cumulative planned value to date? 2. What is the cumulative earned value to date? 3. What is the cumulative actual cost to date? 4. Calculate the cumulative CPI through the end of the statusing period (end of Month 5). 5. Calculate the cumulative SPI through the same time period. 6. What is the estimated final cost based on progress through Month 5? 7. What is the estimated total time of completion (in months)? 8. List two detailed and specific talking points that you would use in a discussion with your boss, the Shands Director of Property, to describe the current progress and forecasted conditions for this project, and explain any variances. Assume she knows little or nothing about the "language" of project management, but she is intelligent and wants to know where the project stands overall as well as causes and effects of any issues based on your analysis.

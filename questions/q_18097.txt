Prior to an advertising campaign in a certain region, the proportion of high school students from the region who reported that they always wear their seatbelts when traveling in a car was 0.60. At the completion of the advertising campaign, in a random sample of high school students from this region, 128 out of 200 reported that they always wear their seatbelts when traveling in a car. Is this sample evidence sufficient to conclude that the proportion of high school students in this region who report always wearing a seatbelt is now greater than 0.60? Let  be the proportion of high school students from this region who (following the advertising campaign) report always wearing their seatbelts while traveling in a car.

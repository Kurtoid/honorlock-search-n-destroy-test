In Phase I of the coagulation cascade both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways lead to the formation of [21](21), which then leads to the end goal of phase I which is formation of the enzyme [22](22). This enzyme then plays the key role in Phase II of turning [23](23) into [24] (24) which is also an enzyme that plays the key role of phase III which is turning [25](25) into [26] (26). The action of the key enzyme in phase III is directly blocked by the blood clotting drug called [27](27). Whereas 2 other blood clotting drugs work by blocking platelet aggregation (put one of those drugs here): [28] (28). Finally the enzyme that directly breaks down the clot (fibrinolysis: breaking down the clot) after healing has begun is called [29](29).       A. Thrombin   E. Fibrin   I. Thromboxane A2   M.

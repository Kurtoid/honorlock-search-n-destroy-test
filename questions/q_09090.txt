QUESTION 4     An experiment was conducted to determine the isotopes of a sample of chlorine gas. Two isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37 were found.     4.1   Describe how this specific experimental method is used to analyse the chlorine isotopes.   (2)     4.2   Explain which characteristic determines that these are isotopes? Give numbers to substantiate your explanation.      (3)     4.3   The relative isotopic abundances in the specific sample were determined and listed in the table below. Use these values to determine the relative atomic mass of Cl2 in the sample.   (2)             Isotope   Abundance     Cl-35.5   73.6%     Cl-37   26.4%             4.4   Draw a mass spectrum showing the peaks that would result from this experiment.                   (3)

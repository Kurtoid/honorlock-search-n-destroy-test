17.  In a certain squirrel species, body color is determined by a single autosomal gene with two alleles that show incomplete dominance: (B) for black fur and (b) for white fur.  A population geneticist scores the fur color of 200 individuals from a population of this squirrel and her results are summarized below. Phenotype     Genotype     Number of squirrels Black                BB                   92 Gray                 Bb                   96 White               bb                   12 Total                                       200 Given this information, we now ask you to please do a Chi-square test to determine whether this squirrel population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  Specifically, please do this Chi-square test so that you can answer the following three questions.  FIRST (4 points) - What is the expected number of gray heterozygous squirrels according to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? SECOND (4 points) - What is the value of the Chi-square statistic for this problem?  That is, what is X2 equal to for this problem? THIRD (5 points) - According to your Chi-square test, is this squirrel population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?

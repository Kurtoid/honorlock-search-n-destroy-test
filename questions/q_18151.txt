3 Groundwater Flow Two wells have been installed in the surficial aquifer of GFW (see figure below). They are 500m apart and the west well (well A) has a water table elevation of 50 m (above sea level) and the well on the east boundary (well B) has a water table elevation of 40 m. Ksat for this coarse sandy aquifer is 10 m/d.  Additional wells (not shown) on the north and south boundaries  show no water table slope from North to South (i.e. flow is entirely in the A-to-B or west-to-east direction).  Assume the potentiometric gradient and Ksat are uniform across the watershed, and that no water leaks through the confining unit below.

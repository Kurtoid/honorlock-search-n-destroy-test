1.  (Time Value of Money). (95 points). Solve the following time value of money problem: Assume that you are 22 years old today (Happy Birthday!) and you decide to spend the next few minutes preparing a strategic financial plan for the remainder of your life.  Overall, you plan to work until your 65th birthday (43 more years).  At that point, you would like to retire and spend the rest of your years cruising around in a motor home until you move into a nursing home and let Medicare pay for you (which you expect to occur on your 85th birthday). Assume you have developed the following cash flow estimates to support your strategic financial plan.  First, you determine that you currently have nothing saved (AHHH!).  However, based upon your current employment prospects and living expenses, you expect to save $250 at the end of each month for the next 15 years.  At such time you expect a huge promotion, which will then enable you to instead save twice as much at the end of each month for the final years you plan to work. On your 65th birthday (retirement), you plan to sell the home you have been living in and purchase your motor home.  Given the current value of your home and expected market conditions, you expect to get a net of $1,200,000 on the sale of your home and will give 20% of that net sale amount to charity.  At the same time, you will pay $350,000 for your awesome new motor home.  You estimate that you will need $125,000 at the beginning of each year (beginning on your 65th birthday) to pay for all of your living expenses for this motor home traveling retirement lifestyle.  You will need this income until your big nursing home move at age 85.  Finally, you estimate that you can earn an average 9% annual return, compounded monthly, on your money now until your 51st birthday, and estimate that you will be conservative and only earn an average of 5% annually (again compounded monthly) from your 51st birthday until retirement on your 65th birthday.  Given the above strategic financial plan: a.  Determine how much you will have in savings when you retire on your 65th birthday (after selling the house, giving to charity and buying the motor home). b.  Determine what annual rate of return you must earn on your money during retirement to be able to withdraw the money you need during this time period and have a $0 balance when you head to the nursing home. c.  Now assume that you just got a call from your rich Uncle Dylan and he is going to give you a large sum of money for your birthday today.  Assuming that you could earn an 8.5% annual return with semiannual compounding on this money from today until your 65th birthday, how much money does Uncle "D" need to give you today so that you would not have to save any money between today and retirement (i.e. not have to save the $250 and $500 monthly amounts described above), and still have the same amount available during retirement after selling the house, giving to charity and buying the RV?

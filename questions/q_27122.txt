One species of lizard mates with another species. However, the sperm produced by the father fails to divide by meiosis and is diploid. The resulting offspring has 3 sets of chromosomes and automatically becomes a new species.  What form of speciation is this and what would be the name of this specific type of polyploidy?

Or you may write down your answer (including calculations, illustrations, diagrams, etc.) on a piece of blank paper. Show your answer to your camera for a few seconds once you're done with this question, and within 10 minutes after you have completed the entire exam in Honorlock, scan all your hand-written answers and send to Dr. Xue (jxue@mse.ufl.edu).   Bulk crystal growth (16 points) (a) Please describe the major steps involved in the Czochralski growth process for growing bulk silicon crystals starting from electronic grade silicon. (6 points) (b) If we want to grow compound semiconductors such as GaAs, what modifications are needed for the Czochralski process? (5 points) (c) There will be significant amount of silicon vacancies formed during the single crystal growth. When the crystal is cooled, the equilibrium concentration of vacancies will be significantly reduced. However, the excess vacancies may coalesce into circular loops on {111} planes. Assuming that these loops have a diameter of 10 nm, please calculate the number of loops/cm3 that would form from these excess vacancies in a silicon crystal after it is cooled from a temperature of 1400degC to 800degC. The formation energy of silicon vacancies is 2.3 eV.   (5 points)

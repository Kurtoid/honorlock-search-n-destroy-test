When potassium cyanide (KCN) reacts with acids, a deadly poisonous gas, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is produced according to the following equation:   2 KCN(aq)  + H2SO4(aq)   -  K2SO4(aq)  + 2 HCN(g)   If 30.5 mL of a 0.250 M KCN solution is reacted with an excess of H2SO4, calculate the amount of HCN formed (in grams).

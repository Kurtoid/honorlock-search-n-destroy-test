A certain type of congenital deafness in humans is caused by a rare autosomal (first 22 pairs of chromosomes=autosomes) dominant gene. Address all the prompts/question listed below. You are required to use the letters as given to represent alleles. List the letter of the question asked and then your response.  This is a one trait cross (5 points).  D=Deaf d=Normal Hearing A. In a mating involving a deaf man and a deaf woman, could all the children have normal hearing (remember chance has no memory)?  Answer Yes or No B. Explain your answer. You must full describe how you computed the problem using scratch paper. List the Genotype Ratio and Phenotype Ratio of the cross to support your answer to prompt A.

Consider two different implementations, M1 and M2, of the same instruction set. There are three classes of instructions (A, B, and C) in the instruction set. M1 has a clock rate of 80 MHz and M2 has a clock rate of 100 MHz. The average number of cycles for each instruction class and their frequencies (for a typical program) are as follows:    Instruction Class  Machine M1 - Cycles/Instruction Class   Machine M2 - Cycles/Instruction Class  Frequency   A 1 2 60%   B 2 3 30%   C 4 4 10%      (a) Calculate the average CPI for each machine, M1, and M2. (b) Calculate the average MIPS ratings for each machine, M1 and M2. (c) Which machine has a smaller MIPS rating ? Which individual instruction class CPI do you need to change, and by how much, to have this machine have the same or better performance as the machine with the higher MIPS rating (you can only change the CPI for one of the instruction classes on the slower machine)?

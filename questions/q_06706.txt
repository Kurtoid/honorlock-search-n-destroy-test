Displacements of two trusses are confined to one plane.  Each node of the assembly has two degrees of freedom in the global coordinate system.  Both the trusses in the assembly have the same cross-sectional area, A; same elastic modulus, E; and the same length, L.  A downward force of magnitude, P is applied to node-2 of the structure.      Compute the stiffness matrix of each bar in the assembly (10 points) Compute the stiffness matrix of the constrained assembly with the boundary conditions applied on the structure. (5 points) Write equations for the structure in the following form: [K]{d}={R}  (5 points)

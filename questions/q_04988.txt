Based on the regression equations above, what is the impact of the new wing program with respect to LOS and READMYS, and how do these results to date square with the stated interest/hope of the State Dept. of Health and the hospital as mentioned above? In presenting the impact of the new wing program, make reference to the coefficients and p-values for the variable shown as EXPTL (which equals 1 if the patient is in the experimental wing and 0 if not in the experimental wing and thus in the control group) ;  you do not need to make extensive calculations to answer this particular question; you do need to think about what the coefficients and p values for EXPTL are suggesting about program impact on LOS and READMYS.
(1/6) JT was found in his dorm unresponsive with a bottle of Vicodin on the floor.  He was taken to an emergency room, stabilized and admitted to the medical floor for 24-hour observation.  When questioned, he denied suicidal thoughts and continually requested discharge stating: "Everything is fine. I need to go to school in the morning. I have a test." Concerned for his safety, the RN requests a consultation with the Psychiatric Emergency Team (P.E.T.) clinician.  The P.E.T. RN assesses JT and determines that he is in imminent danger of harming himself.  Collateral data shows a recent break-up with his girlfriend and failing grades in school. His appetite is poor and he finds it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. His relationship with his parents is "strained" at best, as they require "perfect behavior and excellent grades." The P.E.T. Team RN places him on a 5150 with a plan to transfer to an inpatient behavioral health facility in the morning. What criteria did the Psychiatric Emergency Team (P.E.T.) RN use to certify/validate the need for a 5150?

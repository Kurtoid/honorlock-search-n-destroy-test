Ferdinand Marcos was elected president of the Philippines in 1965. Marcos was reelected in 1969 and when barred to run for a third term, he declared martial law and gave himself near absolute power. Marcos assumed full control of the military, dissolved congress, and had many of his political opponents and critics arrested. One of his more prominent critics had been Senator Benigno Aquino who was prepared to challenge Marcos in the 1973 election, had it occurred.  Aquino would spend seven years in jail in the Philippines before he developed a heart condition. The Marcos regime had falsely convicted Aquino of murder and sentenced him to death, but the United States stepped in to provide him with proper treatment for his condition. Marcos allowed Aquino to leave the Philippines and receive treatment. During the time of dictatorship in the Philippines, Imelda Marcos, the Dictator's spouse became a global icon of 1980s excess.  In 1981 an auction house in New York cancelled a $5 million auction of fine art, furnishings, and pottery because Imelda had purchased the entire catalogue.  The couple had a presidential yacht, custom jewels, several residences, an art collection, gold bars and gold bullion.  During one trip to New York in May 1983, Imelda Marcos spent $3 million (the equivalent of $8.1 million in 2021) in one day: $2 million at exclusive New York jewelers and another $1.3 million on other merchandise, including $23,000 for books, $43,370 for silver flatware, $10,000 for an antique dessert service, $34,880 for limousines, $20,046 for unspecified "shopping" and $10,340 for bed sheets. Aquino would spend three years in the United States before deciding to return to the Philippines in 1983 to remove Marcos from power. He made this decision despite having heard that many people would be looking to kill him when he returned. After having read the writings of Gandhi while incarcerated, he was inspired to employ nonviolence to overthrow Marcos.   On August 21, 1983, Benigno Aquino arrived in the Philippines and almost immediately after landing, police vans surrounded his jet and three police officers shot and killed him.  The news of Aquino's death received intense international coverage, but Marcos prevented any media outlets in the Philippines from covering his death. Aquino's mother, Aurora, made sure to leave her son's body as it was, unaltered for all the world to see. For days, Filipinos visited Aquino's body and paid homage to him and his struggle against Marcos.  As the Philippines sunk deeper and deeper into debt, business leaders became frustrated with Marcos and demanded reforms. Consequently, Marcos reinstated the vice presidency and reduced restrictions on age qualifications to run for president and vice president. On February 15, 1986, a presidential election was held and Aquino's widow, Corazon ran for president.  The Filipino parliament officially declared Marcos to be the winner. According to the assembly, Marcos had won by a count of 10,807,197 votes to Corazon's 9,292,761 votes.  However, data suggested that Corazon had won by nearly 800,000 votes. Three days later, the United States Congress condemned the election and voted to cut military support until Marcos stepped down. On February 24, Corazon visited her supporters at the park and inspired opposition members of parliament to write a new resolution that revoked the results of the corrupt election and declared her president. The following day, Aquino's mother swore Corazon in as president of the Philippines and Marcos fled the country with the help of the United States to Hawaii. Shortly after her inauguration, President Aquino enacted Executive Order No. 1, which created the Presidential Commission on Good Government to recover assets that Mr. Marcos, Mrs. Marcos, and their family had misappropriated during the Marcos presidency.   For many, Imelda will forever be known as the beauty queen turned ostentatious dictator's wife whose dressing room - when it was overrun by revolutionaries in 1986 - was found to contain 1,200 pairs of shoes. It is alleged that the Marcos' illegally amassed a fortune of close to $10 billion, during their 20 years in power.   Mr. Marcos is deceased, and Mrs. Marcos serves as the family matriarch and has been allowed to return to the Philippines.  Mrs. Marcos is a US citizen and splits her time between Hawaii and Manila, Philippines.  In 2001 the Presidential Commission on Good Government ended its work having recovered a great deal of wealth for the Philippines.  In 2001 a suit between the government of the Philippines and Mrs. Marcos ended with a consent decree that any art purchased or otherwise acquired by the Marcos family from 1973 to 1987 was property of the government of the Philippines.   In 2020 there was a fire at a leading auction house in New York and it was reported widely that several items were destroyed.  Luckily, the auction house is fully insured for losses and damages.     Mrs. Marcos just recently noticed that she is missing a Monet from her collection.  Mrs. Marcos initiates a lawsuit against the New York auction house for the return of the Monet, valued at $15 million.  She alleges that the piece had been stored at the auction house since 1995.  On April 30, 2021, the last day of the replevin statute of limitations the suit was filed.  After filing Mrs. Marcos had a trusted friend take an inventory of her artwork.  Today upon review of the inventory Mrs. Marcos realizes that she might be able to allege that the auction house has another piece by Monet, small and worth $2 million.     The auction house staff upon being served with Imelda's complaint is shocked.  It is widely believed internally that the auction house gave all the Marcos' holdings to the government of the Philippines in 2000.  However, the records are not complete because of the fire.  An additional complication, when the auction house searched its inventory list it discovers a Monet valued at $2 million.  This piece was thought to be a part of an unclaimed collection in the distant past.  It is displayed in the foyer of the auction house.  A closer look at the piece and the remaining records leaves little doubt that this piece was placed in storage by the Marcos family many years ago.     Please discuss the all joinder and preclusion issues.

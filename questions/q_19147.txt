Two boxes are sliding on a horizontal frictionless surface in 1-D.  Box m1 = 8.0 kg, sliding at 16 m/s x^{"version":"1.1","math":"16 m/s x^"}, collides with box m2 = 10.0 kg, sliding at -7.0 m/s x^{"version":"1.1","math":"-7.0 m/s x^"}.  They stick together and both boxes slide up a frictionless slope.  a)  Find the velocity of the two boxes after the collision. b)  Find the maximum height above the base of the slope to which the boxes slide. Start with given equations.  Show all your work.

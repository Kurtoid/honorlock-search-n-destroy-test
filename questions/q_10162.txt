Recently Dr. Bock told her husband to pick up a certain perfume at Dillard's. Before he left to go the store, Dr. Bock called Dillard's and informed them of the brand and bottle size she wanted and had the sales associate put her item to the side so that when her husband arrived, he would purchase the correct item. Later that day when Dr. Bock got home from work, she picked up the bottle of perfume that was sold to her husband and immediately saw it was the wrong size (not what she wanted). That evening, Dr. Bock went to the store to exchange the item and when doing so, spoke with the sales associate. The sales associate sincerely apologized and gave Dr. Bock $50.00 worth of free product along with the size Dr. Bock wanted. Dr. Bock was highly satisfied because of the sales associate's actions in recognizing her mistake. What course concept is reflected in this situation?

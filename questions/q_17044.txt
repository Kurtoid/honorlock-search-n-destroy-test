1. (35 points) A Rankine steam plant operates with reheat and an open feedwater heater (OFWH). Steam exits the boiler at 560degC and 8.0 MPa. The steam exits the high pressure turbine at 1.0 MPa.  Some of the steam goes to the OFWH and the rest is reheated to 540degC.  The steam exits the low pressure turbine at the condenser pressure of 70 kPa.  The pumps are ideal, the turbines have an efficiency of 90%. The table provides some of the properties that you will need. You DON'T need to fill in EVERY blank in the table.                 a. Determine the mass fraction of steam extracted and directed to the OFWH, in percent.

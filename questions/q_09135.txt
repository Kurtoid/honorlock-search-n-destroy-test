Work in the coal breakers is exceedingly hard and dangerous. Crouched over the chutes, the boys sit hour after hour, picking out the pieces of slate and other refuse from the coal as it rushes past to the washers. From the cramped position they have to assume, most of them become more or less deformed and bent-backed like old men. When a boy has been working for some time and begins to get round-shouldered, his fellows say that "He's got his boy to carry round wherever he goes." The coal is hard, and accidents to the hands, such as cut, broken, or crushed fingers, are common among the boys. Sometimes there is a worse accident: a terrified shriek is heard, and a boy is mangled and torn in the machinery, or disappears in the chute to be picked out later smothered and dead. Clouds of dust fill the breakers and are inhaled by the boys, laying the foundations for asthma and miners' consumption. . . . Boys twelve years of age may be legally employed in the mines of West Virginia, by day or by night, and for as many hours as the employers care to make them toil or their bodies will stand the strain.   - John Spargo, The Bitter Cry of Children, 1906   Question: Writers such as Spargo who exposed the exploitation of workers were known as

A gas contained within a piston-cylinder assembly undergoes three processes in series:   Process 1-2: Constant pressure expansion at 10 bar from V1=0.3 m3 to V2=1 m3 Process 2-3: Constant volume cooling from state 2 to state 3 where p3=3 bar. Process 3-1: Compression from state 3 to the initial state during which the pressure-volume relationship is pV=constant.    Sketch the processes in series on p-V coordinates Evaluate the work for each process, in kJ. (Fill in blanks)  Work for Process 1-2 is [W12] kJ Work for Process 2-3 is [W23] kJ  Work for Process 3-1 is [W31] kJ   Calculate the net work done on or by the system  Net Work is [Wnet] kJ    Note: 1 bar = 100 kPa

13.  Challenge problem.  You need to calculate the molar solubility of iron(III) hydroxide at pH 5.76.  Sadly, you cannot locate your table of solubility product values.  However, you are able to calculate the standard Gibbs free energy for the reaction below.                Fe(OH)3(s)   =   Fe3+(aq)  +  3 OH-(aq)                 DGo = +220.2 kJ         Using this information, calculate the molar solubility of iron(III) hydroxide at pH 5.76.  [Remember, challenge problems are based on material from two or more chapters.  Piece together what needs to be done to solve the problem.  Hint:  What quantity or concept is related to both DGo and molar solubility?]  (10 pts)

A child psychologist is interested in the number of times a newborn baby's crying wakes its mother after midnight. For a random sample of 50 mothers, the following information was obtained. Let X = the number of times per week a newborn baby's crying wakes its mother after midnight. For this example, x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  P(x) = the probability that X takes on value x. Is this a discrete probability distribution function?    X P(x)   0 P(x = 0) = 6/50   1 P(x = 1) = 8/50   2 P(x = 2) = 20/50   3 P(x = 3) = 15/50   4 P(x = 4) = 7/50   5 P(x = 5) = 3/50      Check ALL that apply.

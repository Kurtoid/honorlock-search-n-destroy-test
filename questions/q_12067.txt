Comparison of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) before and after a walk on a cold winter's day for a random sample of 9 asthmatics. There are two columns, one of PEFR's before the walk and the other of PEFR's after the walk.    Subject 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Before 312 242 340 388 296 224 391 502 290   After 300 201 232 312 220 236 328 330 231    From the output determine whether there is a difference in the before and after flow rates.   The code that was run is Before=c(312,242,340,388,296,224,391,502,290)After=c(300,201,232,312,220,236,328,330,231)library(EnvStats)eqnpar(Before-After,p=0.5,type=6,ci=T) Results of Distribution Parameter Estimation--------------------------------------------Assumed Distribution:            NoneEstimated Quantile(s):           Median = 63Quantile Estimation Method:      NonparametricData:                            Before - AfterSample Size:                     9Confidence Interval for:         50'th %ileConfidence Interval Method:      interpolate (Nyblom, 1992)Confidence Interval Type:        two-sidedConfidence Level:                95%Confidence Limit Rank(s):        2 3 8 7 Confidence Interval:             LCL =  18.6093                                 UCL = 100.7070

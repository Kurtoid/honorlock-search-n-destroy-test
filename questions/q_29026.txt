Answer the following question from your Reading2. Show all your work. No marks will be given to unsubstantiated answers. Consider the following puzzle, a variant of which was set by Paul J Ferraro and Laura O. Taylor to economists at a major academic conference back in 2005. Imagine that you have a free ticket(which you cannot resell) to see Radiohead performing. But, by a staggering coincidence, you could also go to see Lady Gaga--there are tickets on sale for PS40. You'd be willing to pay PS50 to see Lady Gaga on any given night, and her concert is the best alternative to seeing Radiohead. Assume there are no other costs of seeing either gig.  Calculate the opportunity cost of seeing Radiohead.

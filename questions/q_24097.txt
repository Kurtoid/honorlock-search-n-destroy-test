Jerry, a partner in the JSK partnership, begins the year on January 1, 2021 with a capital balance of $20,000. The JSK partnership agreement states that Jerry receives 6% interest on his monthly weighted average capital balance without regard to normal drawings. Each partner draws $5,000 in cash from the business every quarter. Any withdrawal in excess of that will be accounted for as a direct reduction of the partner's capital balance. On March 1, 2021, when the partnership tax return for 2020 was completed, Jerry's capital account was credited for his share of 2020 profit of $120,000.Jerry withdrew $5,000 quarterly, beginning March 31st.On September 1, Jerry's capital account was credited with a special bonus of $60,000 for business he brought to the partnership.

1 page It is proposed to extend the detection of loop invariants as follows: a dynamic loop invariant is the one which becomes an invariant under certain control flow conditions of 1st iteration of the surrounding loop. In other words, an IR statement becomes invariant because the 1st iteration of the surrounding loop follows a conditional path that reinforces and makes the IR statement as invariant through the remainder of the execution of the loop. A good example of dynamic invariant is the one encountered in SCCP (Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation) that leads to the reinforcement of the optimistic lattice condition. It is desired to detect such a dynamic invariant without being limited to constants as in the case of SCCP. Devise a SSA based technique along with an illustration to detect such invariants assuming multiple definition points of a variable in the loop, Make no assumptions about the r-values of assignments to such definition points

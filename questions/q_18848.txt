Consider the following project    Activity predecessor duration (Days) resources (workers)   Start -- 0 0   A Start 3 7   B Start 2 3   C A 9 2   D A 5 10   E B 3 4   F B 2 5   G D,E 5 6   End C,F,G 0 0                              Given this project and the requirement that the number of resources working on a task cannot be less than the number assigned to the task, answer the following questions. 1. What is the total number of worker days required for the project?(2 points) 2. What is the least amount of time that the project can be completed and how many resources are required to complete the project at that time? What is the critical path?(3 points) 3. Tabulate the number of workers required for each day during the project. You can create a table with 2 columns indicating the day and the corresponding number of workers for the day. (1 points) Calculate the slack for each activity (1 points)    Day # of workers            4. a) What is the minimum number of workers you need if you want to complete the project within the minimum time obtained in (2) above  (i.e., you do not want to extend the project completion time)?     b) Tabulate the activities and their predecessors (similar to first 2 columns of the table above) to show the new network or           you can copy paste the Gantt chart from the excel directly. Make sure the timeline and durations are shown correctly. (5 points)      Activity Predecessor            5. What is the critical path after resource balancing? (2 points)

A property owner has set up a contract in which he agrees to sell a warehouse 5 years from now to the tenant who currently leases the space. The tenant has agreed to continue to pay $50,000 in rent at the end of each year, including year five, at which time he will purchase the building for an additional $1,000,000. Assuming the required rate of return on a similar investment is 8% (annual), how much is this deal presently worth to the original owner of the property?
Two singly-charged uranium isotopes--235U (mass: 3.90 x 10-25 kg) and 238U (mass: 3.95 x 10-25 kg)--enter a mass spectrometer at the same location while moving with a speed of 3.0 x 105 m/s.  The spectrometer uses a uniform magnetic field with a magnitude of 0.60 T directed perpendicular to the velocity of the particles to separate the isotopes.  Each isotope travels in a half-circle before hitting different parts of a detector.  What is the distance separating the locations where each isotope hit the detector?

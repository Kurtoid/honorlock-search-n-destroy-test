A nasty trick to play on a water strider bug is to add detergent to a puddle on which the strider is standing. Water striders are light enough to stand on the water's surface. Adding a detergent or other surfactant to the puddle would cause the water strider to sink. What must a surfactant do to change the water surface?
You are working in a factory that produces metal wires that are long cylinders in shape. You are attempting to optimize the amount of metal used in the manufacturing process. A typical wire is 1000 mm long and has a radius of 1 mm. However, the manufacturing process has some variance. After some data collection, you believe the maximum error in the length of the wires is 0.5 mm, and the maximum error in the radius is 0.01 mm. a) Use a differential to estimate the maximum error in the volume of the wire. b) Your coworker states that the variance in the length is more important than the variance in the radius because 0.5 is much bigger than 0.01. Respond to your coworker's claim.
Case study #4 Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent causative agent of malaria. This parasite has a trophozoite form that must undergo a life cycle within the gut of the female Anopheles mosquito to be naturally transmitted to the next host. The parasite also has separate trophozoite forms in the liver and blood of humans. If the malaria parasite is introduced into a pregnant woman, it can cross the placental barrier and infect the developing fetus. People at increased risk for malaria infection are children under 5 years old, pregnant women, and people with AIDS (active HIV infection).   There are relatively few drugs available to treat malaria that do not result in severe side effects in humans. One reason for this is because P. falciparum

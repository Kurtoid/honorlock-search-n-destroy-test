The patient is a 24-year-old male who received an orthotopic liver transplant two months ago to treat his primary biliary cirrhosis.  The patient was admitted at this time after a transplant clinic visit on the same day because of a generalized macular rash on his chest.  The patient also complained of diarrhea and an enlarging abdomen that the physicians identified as ascites.  A skin biopsy of the chest was performed and revealed a significant number of donor lymphocytes due to acute graft-versus-host (GVH) disease.  The physicians informed the patient that his acute GVH disease is a complication of his liver transplant but can be treated with medications such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, antibiotics, and immunoglobulins.  The patient remained in the hospital for five days and started on a medication regimen with relief of his diarrhea and lessening of the symptoms of the ascites and the rash.  The patient was discharged home with home health services and an appointment with the transplant clinic in two weeks.

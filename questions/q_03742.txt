In what section of an appellate brief would this paragraph be found?   The subject tract of land is a 580.23 acre tract of nearly level agricultural land in the Little Brazos River bottom that is being used primarily for crop production. Pursuant to the Texas Property Code, on October 2, 2008, a hearing was held before three Special Commissioners to determine the fair market value of the property taken. The Special Commissioners awarded $998,047.50 for the easement and all damages to the remainder of the tract. Kelo then deposited the awarded amount with the court, along with a cost bond, and received a writ of possession on October 29, 2008, to proceed with construction of the pipeline along the easement. The award was drawn down from the court's registry by Allen.   The date of taking for the easement was, therefore, October 29, 2008, which was the date Kelo obtained possession of the easement. Kelo filed objections to the award of the commissioners on October 16, 2008. The parties stipulated that Kelo had the right to take the subject easement pursuant to condemnation and that Kelo had properly followed all procedures required by the Texas Property Code to exercise the power of eminent domain. As a result, the only remaining issue to be determined was the proper compensation for the taking. Pursuant to the objections, the district court, the Honorable Stacey Hill presiding, conducted a trial de novo to determine the fair market value of the property taken. A jury trial was held during the week of September 15-17, 2009. The jury returned a verdict assessing the value of the easement taken and any and all damages to the remainder at $268,170.00. The verdict was accepted by the court and a Final Judgment was entered on January 14, 2010. Following timely post-trial motions, Kelo filed its Notice of Appeal to this court on April 6, 2010.

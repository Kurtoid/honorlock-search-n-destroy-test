The diagram below shows an object, an image, and the location of an optical component, which is either a mirror or a lens. You will need to determine what that optical component needs to be and its magnification in the given scenario.     I recommend the following procedure, answering each part of the question in order:   Look at the position of the object and the image and the nature of the image (real or virtual). That should be enough to tell you whether the optical component is a mirror or a lens. Which one is it? [1] Now, taking into consideration the sign conventions for a lens or a mirror, whichever you are working with, use the distances to find the focal length of the optical component. What is the focal length? [4] Now consider the focal length. Is the optical component converging or diverging? [1] What is the magnification in this scenario? [3]

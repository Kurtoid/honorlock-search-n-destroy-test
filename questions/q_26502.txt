Identify which sentence in the following paragraph is the topic sentence:      Americans have always been of two minds about the city. They like to boast of its skyscrapers and bridges, its culture and sophistication, and they pride themselves on its bigness and bustle. At the same time, they fear it as the city of sin, the home of immigrant slums, the center of vice and crime. Nowhere did the divided view of the American city take form more graphically than in Chicago in 1893.   --Roark et al., The American Promise: A History of the United States, Bedford/St. Martin's.

What type of response occurs if the patient responds when there is no light being presented in the VF?
According to the Family Systems Model, financial strain increases mothers' and fathers'______, which, in turn, make parents more irritable, which adversely affects the quality of their parenting.
Why is it difficult to analyze the three components of an attitude separately? Provide a workplace example that demonstrates the three components.
Which of these is the organization fighting to eliminate the negative label given to mental illness?
Hair is produced by the hair bulb and is composed primarily of dead keratinized cells.
If a patient asks the PTA a question that is not in range of his knowledge, who should the PTA refer the question?
Oxygen Generation (Canvas Q30~36, Handwritten Q31/34) Oxygen is necessary for humans: a lack of oxygen is incompatible with life. A nuclear-powered submarine, which has a constant and steady supply of electricity, can generate oxygen from the electrolysis of water. However, in case of power loss, nuclear submarines also keep a supply of oxygen candles. Unlike a regular candle that consumes oxygen as it burns, these candles actually release oxygen gas instead, via the thermal decomposition of chlorate salts. (We've seen a similar reaction when we watched the video on the combustion of a gummy bear.) As seen in the equation below, the thermal decomposition of sodium chlorate releases 3 moles of oxygen gas for every 2 moles of sodium chlorate. This reaction is slightly exothermic, but not actually exothermic enough to sustain the reaction: this decomposition requires temperatures greater than 300 degC, which is unattainable with the quantities of sodium chlorate used. 2 NaClO3 (s) - 2 NaCl (s) + 3 O2 (g)          DHdegrxn = -105.0 kJ A typical oxygen candle also contains iron powder, which will react with the oxygen gas to form iron(III) oxide. 2 Fe (s) + 1.5 O2 (g) - Fe2O3 (s)          DHdegrxn = -825.5 kJ However, this reaction actually consumes oxygen gas! Based on your understanding of thermochemistry and the thermochemical equations provided above, why might an oxygen candle include iron in its composition, even though it uses up some of the oxygen that the candle is trying to produce?

Reacting the carbon in pencil "lead" with hydrogen gas produces methane gas according to the following reaction.  How much hydrogen gas would be consumed, in grams, during a reaction where 1500 kJ of energy were released? C(graphite) + 2H2(g) --> CH4(g)                        [?]Hdegrxn= -74.6 kJ/mol

(Oung Migraine/MS) GT is a 29 yoF that presents to the pharmacy with unilateral headache. The headache started about one hour ago. She describes the headache as "an ice pick through my eye." She denies nausea; however, has nasal congestion. She is actively pacing back and forth. What kind of headache is GT most likely experiencing, matched with an appropriate abortive treatment option?

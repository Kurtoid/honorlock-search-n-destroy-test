A company had the following purchases and sales during its first year of operations:    On December 31, there were 26 units remaining in ending inventory. Using the perpetual FIFO inventory costing method, what is the cost of the ending inventory? (Assume all sales were made on the last day of the month.)

Air traffic controllers have the crucial task of ensuring that aircraft don't collide. To do this, they must quickly discern when two planes are about to enter the same air space at the same time. They are aided by video display panels that track the aircraft in their sector and alert the controller when two flight paths are about to converge. The display panel currently in use has a mean "alert time" of 15 seconds. (The alert time is the time elapsing between the instant when two aircraft enter into a collision course and when a controller initiates a call to reroute the planes.) According to Ralph Rudd, a supervisor of air traffic controllers at the Greater Cincinnati International Airport, a new display panel has been developed that uses artificial intelligence to project a plane's current flight path into the future. This new panel provides air traffic controllers with an earlier warning that a collision is likely. It is hoped that the mean "alert time," m, for the new panel is less than 8 seconds. In order to test the new panel, 15 randomly selected air traffic controllers are trained to use the panel and their alert times for a simulated collision course are recorded. The sample alert times (in seconds) are: 7.2, 7.5, 8.0, 6.8, 7.2, 8.4, 5.3, 7.3, 7.6, 7.1, 9.4, 6.4, 7.9, 6.2, 8.7. Hint: Formulas below remind you how to calculate confidence interval. You need to plug in some of the numbers in the Excel output to do the calculation for Q3.    This is output by Excel. Using the output to answer the following questions.    Q1: What is the point estimation of the population mean alert time? Q2: What is the level of significance? (Hint: a) Q3: Please find the confidence interval for the population mean alert time, m, for the new panel. (Please show your work and round your answers to 3 decimal places.)

Answer the following question based on the following scenarioDuring a kitchen inspection you observe the following. A dietary worker eating food off the line which hasn't started yet. The dietary aide states they are taste testing the food. You review the temperature logs, all the temps are acceptable, but there are none recorded for the pureed or ground foods. The staff states they took the temps but there is no place to put the results on the form. As you observe the line, you notice they are using appropriate sized scoops, but are putting heaping amounts on each plate of the macaroni and cheese. Per the written menu the regular diet should receive apple pie and the cardiac diet should receive cinnamon apple slices. You notice everyone is receiving the apple pie. As you walk through the rest of the kitchen, you notice the washed dishes being dried with a towel, and you feel one of the pans which is greasy on the outside. In the walk in refrigerator, there is no thermometer present, several lids are not securely on the containers, the zucchini is moldy, and there is an open undated bag of cheese. As you are finishing your inspection, the foodservice director informs you they have had a roach problem. She has the staff pull apart the tray line where a large outlet is located. When she kicks the outlet, several small roaches run out. She tells you, pest control has been out twice now and this is still an issue 34. Which of the following tags would most likely be issued upon inspection? a. F800 - cardiac diet is not receiving apple slicesb. F806 - cardiac diet is not receiving apple slicesc. F812 - cardiac diet is not receiving apple slicesd. F810 - cardiac diet is not receiving apple slices

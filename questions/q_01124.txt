In your email, you'll want to make sure to clarify your expectations and to ask your roommate some questions.

How is this person similar or different to you? What chores do you want your roommate to do? In discussion chores, how might you describe your home/apartment/dorm? What do you want your roommate to do to help you stay healthy? How can this person arrive to your apartment/home from the airport? What would you recommend to be a successful student? For fun on campus, in Starkville, or nearby? How might you end your email?  *If you need an accented letter or other special character in your answer, copy and paste the character you need from this list into the answer box: a e i o u u n A E I O U ! ? **DO NOT use an online translator! It is very obvious, and sometimes Canvas even tells me which translator you used. I do not expect you all to be fluent and perfect in your writing at this point. I DO expect you to use the Spanish you have learned up until this point to complete this assignment.

Salmon live in both fresh water and salt water during their lives. They are born in in fresh water but migrate out to marine waters for most of their life. Eventually, they return to the place they were born in fresh water to spawn. Changing between fresh water and salt water affects the balance of water in their body. Salmon have an internalcontrol system called osmoregulationthatrestores the balance by negative feedback. This is an example of which characteristic of life?

The production of smart speakers uses two inputs: labor (L) and capital (K). The following production function describes how these inputs are combined to produce smart speakers.   Labor (L) is placed in the horizontal axis. The exponents for L is 1/3 and K is 2/3. (a) What is the technical rate of substitution for this production function? (b) Determine what kind of returns to scale this production function exhibits. What is the formula for that kind of returns to scale? (HINT: use f(L,K)) (c) Suppose the price of smart speakers is $60, the wage is $8, and the rental rate is $10. In the short-run, capital is fixed at 125 units. Find the short-run profit-maximizing input, output, and the associated profit.  (d) In the long-run, price, wage, and rental rate are the same as in the short-run. Find the long-run profit-maximizing inputs, output, and the associated profit.

QUESTION 3         3.   The image attached below shows an idealised representation of waves moving from left to right down a river. You measure the time between two consecutive crests passing you as 1,2 seconds.             Right click on the button below to open the image in a new "tab".                        3.1   Identify any other point that is in phase with Point F.   (1)     3.2   Calculate the time taken for six crests to move past a certain point in the path of the wave.   (3)     3.3   What is the amplitude of the wave?   (2)     3.4   Give two letters that are one wavelength apart.   (2)     3.5   What is the length of one wavelength(y)?    (3)     3.6   Draw a labelled diagram of what two wavelengths of this wave would look like if the wavelength remained the same but the amplitude doubled. Make sure to label the wavelength and the amplitude with values.   (3)             [14]

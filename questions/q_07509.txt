The Scarlet Driver's License   A Delaware law features a new version of the scarlet letter. Anyone convicted of a sex crime (including sexual abuse of a child) is immediately issued a new driver's license with a "Y" stamped on the front. The meaning of the code is explained on the back of the license. If the ex-offender moves to another state and turns in the Delaware license, that state would be alerted as to the offender's past conviction. This new law was added to the existing Megan's law, now passed in virtually every state, that requires convicted sex offenders to register with local police and child welfare agencies so that neighbors can be notified even after the offender's sentence has been completed. The sponsor of the new law said, "This additional information will give police the ability to thwart some sex crimes before they occur." Simply checking a person's identification will alert police to a past conviction for a sex crime. Opponents argue that such a label will interface with an ex-offender's ability to get a job, cash a check, rent an apartment, or do anything that requires picture identification. This will impede efforts of former sex offenders to live law-abiding lives. It also unfairly discriminates against sex offenders versus other kinds of ex-offenders.32 *  Argue the moral dilemma of a scarlet letter such as that used in Delaware.   OR Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe planned to pardon his son's felony marijuana conviction, arguing he should have the same second chance as other nonviolent offenders. Kyle Beebe, 34, was convicted 10 years earlier of marijuana possession with intent to deliver. He was sentenced to three years of probation, $1,150 in fines and court costs and had his driver's license suspended for six months. Governor Beebe was the state attorney general when his son was convicted. Beebe is leaving office in two months, and he issued more than 700 pardons since taking office eight years earlier. "I would have done it a long time ago" if his son has asked, "but he took his sweet time about asking," Governor Beebe said. "He was embarrassed." On the same day he announced the pardon the Governor put on hold plans to pardon 34-year-old Michael Jackson, a childhood friend of his son. Jackson was arrested in an Internet sting for trying to meet who he thought was a 14-year-old girl, but turned out to be an undercover police officer. He served a two-year prison sentence for Internet stalking of a child.36 *  Evaluate the moral DILEMMA of the Arkansas Governor pardoning his own son, as well as his friend. Was the governor wrong for doing this did he cross the line of code of professional conduct

Quarterly billing for water usage is shown below.   The 16 data points were used to estimate a regression equation to explain the variation in demand. The trend component was captured by the variable "Period", and then qtr2 represents the possible seasonal component for spring, qtr3 represents the possible seasonal component for Summer, and qtr4 represents the possible seasonal component for Fall. Given the following minitab output...   The regression equation from the printout is:                       Demand = 58.74 + 1.28(Period)+38.46(Qtr2)+92.18(Qtr3) +6.14(Qtr4) Note: Period is the trend component, qtr2 is Spring, qtr3 is Summer, and qtr4 is Fall. 1.

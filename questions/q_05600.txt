Recall that the LinkedList class defines first, last and count and that LinkedUnorderedList is a subclass of the LinkedList class. Given the following method in the LinkedUnorderedList class:public void doesSomething (E item, E otherItem){        Node current = first;        boolean found = false;        while (current != null && !found)        {              if (current.getItem().equals(otherItem))              {                  current.setNext(new Node  (item, current.getNext()));                   if (current == last)                      last = current.getNext();                  found = true;                  count++;              }              current = current.getNext();        }                if (current == null)                throw new ElementNotFoundException("Target not found!");}and the following application class code: LinkedUnorderedList list = new LinkedUnorderedList();         list.addToRear("yellow");list.addToRear("red");list.addToRear("brown");Determine the output produced by the following code segment. You can assume that these statements are executed in order and that subsequent calls to doesSomething will be on the list that may have been modified by the previous call. If an exception is thrown, indicate the type of exception and why it was thrown. Be sure to label your answers a, b, and c.  list.doesSomething("green", "red");System.out.println(list.toString());        list.doesSomething("orange", "brown");System.out.println(list.toString()); list.doesSomething("brown", "blue");System.out.println(list.toString());

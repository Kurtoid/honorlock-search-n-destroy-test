Suppose that a dendritic cell has encountered a foreign antigen from a bacterial cell.  This triggers a series of events that eventually leads to death of the bacterial cell by complement proteins (via the classical pathway).  Describe this series of events leading up to the activation of the complement system. You do not need to include the steps of the complement cascade. Include all the cells/molecules/receptors that are involved. Go into as much detail as you can to comprehensively describe this process. It's recommended that you first draw your answer on your piece of scratch paper before typing your answer in the space below. Even though your drawing won't be collected, it can help you organize your typed-out answer.

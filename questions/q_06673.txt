An observational study is conducted at a certain college to determine if students who join social clubs are more satisfied with their overall college experience. A random sample of students is selected, and each student is asked whether or not they are a member of a social club at the college. Each student is also given a satisfaction survey, and an overall satisfaction score is computed (with higher scores indicating more satisfaction). SPSS was used to create a dummy variable x for the grouping variable (with x=0 meaning the student is not a social club member and x=1 meaning the student is a social club member). Then, a regression model was constructed with this dummy variable as the independent variable and with y=overall satisfaction score as the dependent variable. Use the SPSS output provided below to complete this problem.          Complete each of the tasks below. Clearly label your response to each part. Make sure you respond completely to each part.  Write the equation of the regression model. Then, use it to compute the expected satisfaction score of a student who is a social club member. Interpret the meaning of

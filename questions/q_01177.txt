Consider this Parabola class which is very similar to the one on the review: Exam2Parabola.ipynb  Make the following changes:  (12 pts ) The method for graphing in the class Parabola does NOT work when . This is because the graph function uses the vertex to center the graph. Modify the code so that the graph function will graph a line with . (18pts or 3 points for each case) Create a new method:  def realRoots(self):        """Returns the roots (if any) of the Parabola""" Here are all the cases:    If a, b, c are ALL zero, then every value of x is a real solution. So print 'All real values are roots' If and a and b are zero, but c is nonzero, then there are no real roots. Print 'No real roots' If a is zero, and b is nonzero, then the only root is

In the context of compilation in the presence of Scratch-pad memory (SPM), please answer the following two questions. a) Assume that a given program will not fit in the SPM but if we partition the program in small blocks, some of the blocks can be placed in SPM. Assume, each block i has size si. Using profiling it is possible to compute the gain gi of placing the block i in the SPM instead of placing it in the regular memory. We want to find which of the blocks can be placed in SPM that maximizes the overall gain. The SPM has size S. Furthermore, due to routing constraints up to N blocks can be stored in the SPM. Formulate this as an integer programming problem. Assume, variable xi is 1 if the block i is mapped to the SPM, 0 otherwise. No need to create perfect equations for cost function and constraints as long as it is understandable. For example, the summation of n instances of xi can be shown as:  SUM_1^n (x_i) or  SUM1n (xi). b) Consider a specific instance where a program has three blocks (b1, b2, b3) and the gain (by placing each block in SPM) for the respective blocks are 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The size of the three blocks (b1, b2, b3) are 1, 2, 3 units, respectively. The capacity (size) of the SPM is 3 units. Due to routing constraints up to 2 blocks can be placed in SPM. Show all the solutions (use * to mark feasible ones) and identify the best solution in terms of maximum savings using X. The "Size" column indicates the size required to map the tasks (marked by '1' in the left three columns) to SPM. The "Gain" column indicates the overall gain by mapping the respective tasks to SPM. In the left three columns, '1' means that block has been mapped to SPM ('0' means not mapped to SPM). Please fill in the entries (no explanation required). If you cannot create a table like the following one, please use spaces/tabs as well as newlines so that rows and columns are clear.    b1 b2 b3 Size Gain  Feasible Best   0 0 0       0 0 1       0 1 0       0 1 1       1 0 0       1 0 1       1 1 0       1 1 1
Which of the following is the best option to give to a patient to counteract shock due to high insulin levels?
A.  [C1] = Character 1; [C2] = Character 2 [C1]: Ah,...--This act of [his]--there's a sense of liberation in it. [C2]: Liberation...? Yes, I guess it's a liberation for him, all right. [C1]: I mean, for me. It's a liberation for me to know that in this world an act of such courage, done in full, free will, is possible. Something bathed in a bright shaft of sudden beauty...[he] had the courage to live life his own way, and now--his last great act-- bathed in beauty. He--had the will to break away from the banquet of life--so soon. [C2]: It pains me, [dear]--but I'm forced to shatter this pretty illusion of yours...He didn't shoot himself--so freely...[He] was found shot in [her] boudoir...He came to demand the return of something that he said they'd taken from him. He talked crazily about a lost child...Right there, with a discharged pistol in his coat pocket, and a fatal bullet wound. [C1]: In the chest, yes? [C2]: No--lower down.

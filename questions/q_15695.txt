Beta contracted in a written agreement signed by both parties to purchase widgets from Sigma. The contract contained all the necessary terms, including a zipper clause (merger clause and NOM clause) and further including the following two specific provisions: *     All widgets must weigh between 80 and 90 grams; *     All widgets must be delivered by Sigma to Beta's warehouse in a single delivery on May 1, between the hours of 8 AM and 5 PM EDT. At the time the parties signed the agreement, the Sigma rep asked "I know most widget buyers are perfectly happy with widgets weighing up to 100 grams. Will that work for you if some of the widgets delivered by Sigma weigh between 90 and 100 grams?" The Beta rep said "absolutely--you can deliver any widgets weighing between 80 and 100 grams under this contract, and Beta will accept them." In fact, widgets up to 100 grams would work fine for Beta's intended purposes. Sigma delivered the widgets at 4 PM on May 1. Some widgets weighed more than 90 grams, but all weighed between 80 and 100 grams. Is Beta entitled to reject the widgets?

Order the following steps involved in Deep Clustering with pseudo labelling ( Caron et al. Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning  of Visual Features)    Run our unlabelled inputs through a randomly initialized convnet, cluster the outputs using K means. Run our unlabelled inputs through a convnet trained on Imagenet and cluster the outputs using K means  Assign pseudo labels for an input based on the cluster it belongs to. Assign pseudo labels randomly such that there are equal number of samples for each label Using pseudo labels as true labels, run the convnet feature outputs through a fully connected layer and softmax cross entropy layer and backpropagate through the network.

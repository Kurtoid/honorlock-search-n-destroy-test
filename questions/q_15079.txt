Pepsin is an important ________________ that digests _______________________.
A deficiency in vitamin B12 causes a build up of a specific form of tetrahydrofolate (THF), effectively trapping THF in this form and preventing the regeneration of other forms of THF.  Name the form of tetrahydrofolate that builds up because of a vitamin B12 deficiency.

A 28-year-old woman comes to your gynecology practice to establish care. She is healthy and takes no medications. She is happily married and works for the airline industry. She exercises regularly, and does not use tobacco products or illicit drugs, but will drink a glass of beer "on occasion with dinner". She has no significant family medical history. However, it turns out she has not seen a physician since she was a teenager, and a friend told her that "I need to get caught up on my pap". The best advice you could give her would be:

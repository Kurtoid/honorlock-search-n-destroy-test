Consider the design of two logic circuits that both have four inputs: A, B, C and D; and one output: X.  Each circuit is implemented using 4-input AND gates (with negated inputs) and an OR gate to generate the output.  For circuit 1, X is defined to be 1 if and only if the unsigned binary representation of A, B, C and D is less than 7.Note A is the most significant bit, then B, then C, and D is the least significant. For circuit 2, X is defined to be 1 if and only if the total number of 1's among A, B, C and D is exactly 2.  Which of the following 4-input gates would be used in the implementation of both circuits?

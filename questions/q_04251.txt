Hola! ?Que tal? La semana pasada mi familia y yo viajamos a Lima, Peru.  Eran las tres cuando nosotros llegamos a Lima, y hacia buen tiempo. El botones que nos llevo las maletas a nuestro cuarto era muy guapo. Espero verlo otra vez. Ayer, todos nosotros fuimos a visitar Machu Picchu. Yo  estudie la historia de los incas el ano pasado y me fascina. El viaje de Lima a Machu Picchu era muy, muy largo porque todos los vuelos a Cuzco estuvieron cancelados y finalmente tuvimos que ir en autobus. !Veintisiete horas!... Hoy estamos muy cansados. Bueno, te escribo mas tarde. !Chao! #2. Ellos se quedaron en un hotel.

A federal administrative agency administers a federal statute that requires special, reinforced safety bumpers to be included on "such vehicles as [the agency] shall deem feasible and appropriate in order to promote public safety on the nation's highways." The statute also empowers the agency to make regulations to carry out the statute. Four years ago, the agency, acting after notice and comment, issued a regulation in the Code of Federal Regulations stating that "all vehicles used in business activities" had to include the reinforced bumpers. Now, however, the agency wishes to make a change that would exempt personally owned cars and motorcycles used in business activities (such as by ride-service drivers and pizza deliverers) from the reinforced bumper requirement, while retaining the requirement for large trucks and other similar vehicles used in business. This raises the question of what options the agency has concerning how to proceed - that is, of which form(s) of agency action it may legally use to make this change. How may the agency proceed?

Use the data in the table below to answer questions 32 and 33:  Small sections of dialysis tubing with different concentrations of sucrose in H2O were placed in beakers containing 1M solutions of sucrose in H2O as shown in the table.  The dialysis tubing is not permeable to sucrose.    Beaker Solution in Beaker Solution in Dialysis Tubing   A 1 M sucrose 0.4 M sucrose   B 1 M sucrose 1 M sucrose   C 1 M sucrose 1.8 M sucrose    What would you expect to see after 30 minutes if you compare the final weight of the dialysis tubing placed in beaker C with the weight it had at the beginning of the experiment
In one area of Russia, records were kept on the relationship between the rainfall (in inches) and the yield of wheat (bushels per acre). The data for a 9 year period is as follows:    Rain Fall, x  13.1 11.4 16 15.1 21.4 12.9 9.6 18.2 18.6   Yield, y 48.5 44.2 56.8 80.4 47.2 29.9 74 74 76.8    The equation of the line of least squares is given as = -9.12 + 4.38x. How many bushels of wheat per acre can be predicted if it is expected that there will be 17 inches of rain?

Impairment. Fin Company uses special strapping equipment in its packaging business. The equipment was purchased in January 2019 for $6,000,000 and had an estimated useful life of 8 years with no salvage value. At December 31, 2020, new technology was introduced that would accelerate the obsolescence of Fin's equipment. Fin's controller estimates that expected future net cash flows on the equipment will be $3,750,000 and that the fair value of the equipment is $3,300,000. Fin intends to continue using the equipment, but it is estimated that the remaining useful life is 4 years. Fin uses straight-line depreciation.  Instructions (a)   What is the carrying value of the equipment at December 31, 2020? (b)   Prepare the journal entry (if any) to record the impairment at December 31, 2020. (c)    Prepare any journal entries for the equipment at December 31, 2021. The fair value of the         equipment at December 31, 2021, is estimated to be $3,450,000. (d)   Repeat the requirements for (a) and (b), assuming that Dolphin intends to dispose of the        equipment and that it has not been disposed of as of December 31, 2021.

Sam is going to the gym; he would like to improve his upper body muscle strength, and feels most comfortable using weight machines to perform isolation exercises.  He starts by working his triceps brachii muscle. What movement will he be doing during the concentric phase of the exercise? [1] What movement will he be doing during the eccentric phase of the exercise? [2] Next, Sam wants to work his biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis muscles. What movement will he be doing during the concentric phase of the exercise? [3] What movement will he be doing during the eccentric phase of the exercise? [4] Sam finds a machine that allows him to perform both resisted (concentric) abduction of the arm at the shoulder and, separately, resisted (concentric) adduction of the arm at the shoulder. Which muscles will this machine target? Abduction: [5] Adduction: [6]

Use information below to answer the next few questions. Assume that Alice, John, and Bob can communicate using either Symmetric Key Cryptography and/or Public Key Cryptography, with the following parameters:  Alice and Bob shared the secret key, Ks, with each other.  Only Bob and Alice knows the secret key, Ks. Alice has Bob's and John's public key in her keyring. Bob and John have Alice's public key in their keyrings. Alice's keypair is denoted with Ka- for private key and Ka+ for public key. Bob's keypair is denoted with Kb- for private key and Kb+ for public key. John's keypair is denoted with Kj- for private key and Kj+ for public key. m is the plaintext message. H(x) is the digest of "x" using cryptographic hash function, where "x" can be the plaintext message "m" or other values that goes through the cryptographic hash function. Assume that H(m) received is valid and has not been forged.  Below are the messages received by Alice from Bob.    Msg#  Msg#    1  Ka+(m) 6  m, Ka+( H(m) )    2 Kb+(m) 7  m, Kb+( H(m) )   3  m, H(m) 8  m, Kb- ( H(m) )   4  m, H(Ks + m) 9  Ka+( m, Kb- ( H(m) ) )   5  m, H(m) + Ks 10  Kb+ ( m, Ka+( H(m) ) )    You can use Worksheet D on the Midterm Exam Appendix to help you keep track of the property of each message.   Question Which message(s) would provide Alice a piece of mind that the message(s) can only be read by her, is not forged by someone else, and has not been tampered with during transit?  Pick the best answer.

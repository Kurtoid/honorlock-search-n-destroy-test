The following describes which of the following poets: The austere and tragic view of life that emerges in so many of his poems is modulated by his metaphysical use of detail. As he portrays him, man might be alone in an ultimately indifferent universe, but he may nevertheless look to the natural world for metaphors of his own condition. Thus, in his search for meaning in the modern world, he focuses on those moments when the seen and the unseen, the tangible and the spiritual intersect. John T. Napier calls this poet's ability "to find the ordinary a matrix for the extraordinary." In this respect, he is often compared with Emily Dickinson and Ralph Waldo Emerson, in whose poetry, too, a simple fact, object, person, or event will be transfigured and take on greater mystery or significance.  Yet, just as he is aware of the distances between one man and another, so he is also always aware of the distinction, the ultimate separateness, of nature and man. What he finds in nature is sensuous pleasure; he is also sensitive to the earth's fertility and to man's relationship to the soil. Critics frequently point out that he complicated his problem and enriched his style by setting traditional meters against the natural rhythms of speech. Drawing his language primarily from the vernacular, he avoided artificial poetic diction by employing the accent of a soft-spoken, conversational tone of a  New Englander. His use of New England dialect is only one aspect of his often discussed regionalism in his poetry.

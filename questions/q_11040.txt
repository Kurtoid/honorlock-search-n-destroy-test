While recovering from surgery, an elderly woman started taking a stimulant laxative, senna (Senokot), to relieve constipation caused by the pain medications. Two weeks later, at her follow-up appointment, she tells the nurse that she likes how "regular" her bowel movements are now that she is taking the laxative.

Which of the following is true of early colonial slavery:
The system consists of two massless pulleys (C and D) and two masses (mA = [mA] kg and mB = [mB] kg).  An inextensible, massless cable connect mass A to the fixed point located at E. Gravity acts downward, as shown. Friction between mass A and the surface is modeled using the coefficient of kinetic friction that equals [muk]. Write the equations that would be required to solve for the accelerations of both masses. (These equations could be used to obtain numerical values for both accelerations.) You are not required to solve any of these equations; just write all that would be necessary. There is nothing for you to write in the box below. Your answer will be graded from your written work. Include properly labeled free-body diagram(s) with your solution.

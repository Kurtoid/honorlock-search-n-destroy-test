Three point charges are fixed in space on the coordinate system shown below. The coordinate axes are marked in meters.      a) Find the electric field at point P, located at the origin. b) Calculate the electric field at a point P' at position r= 11 mi + 8 mj [ r=(11 m, 8 m)]. c) Find the force on an additional charge of qo=-6.4x10-6 C placed at the origin. d) What is the force on a charge of 4.9x10-2 C if it is placed at point P'? part a)  Now calculate the magnitudes of each of the contributions to the electric field at point P.    = 1.636   x  105 N/C    = 1.001   x  105 N/C    = 9.250   x  105 N/C E2x= -4.477 x104 N/C E2y=  8.955 x104 N/C EP =   1.188 x105 N/C i + 1.014x106 N/C j = (1.188 x105 N/C , 1.014x106 N/C) part b)    =3.094 x  105 N/C    =3.56 x  104 N/C   =1.05 x  105 N/C         =2.93  x  105 N/C      =-2.268 x  105 N/C part c) Find the force on an additional charge of qo=-6.4x10-6 C placed at the origin part d) What is the force on a charge of 4.9x10-2 C if it is placed at point P'? First of all, the charge from part c) is removed from the origin, and then the new charge is placed at point P'. 21.. Calculate the y-component of the net force on the new charge when it is placed at point P'. Write your answer in standard form (not exponential) and round to the nearest whole number (no decimal). Do not include units. F''y =?

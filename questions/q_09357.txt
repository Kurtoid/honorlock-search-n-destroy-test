Consider the following dice game: you will roll two fair three-sided dice, one red and one green. Each die has sides 1,2,3, which are equally likely to come up. After rolling the dice, you will add together the numbers showing on the dice. If the sum is even, you win that many dollars. If the sum is odd, you lose that many dollars. (For example, if you roll a red 3 and green 2, this adds to 3+2=5, which is odd, so you lose 5 dollars. If you roll a red 1 and green 3, this adds to 1+3=4, which is even, so you win 4 dollars.) (a) (6 points) Compute the probability of winning exactly 4 dollars on a single play of this game. (b) (6 points) Compute the expected value of this game.

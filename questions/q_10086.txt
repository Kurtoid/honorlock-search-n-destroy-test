Several of her maternal relatives, including her mother, have documented symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome or Fragile X Ataxia Tremor Syndrome. Test results reveal that the repeat number (n) for alleles 1 and 2 are 40 and 168 respectively. Which of the following options most accurately interprets the test results?       A She has Fragile X syndrome and should seriously consider another occupation as she will never be able to practice medicine competently.   B She has inherited one FMR1 premutation allele, but given that she currently has no symptoms by the age of 26, it is most likely that she will never develop the disease   C These test results are inconclusive and therefore her 50/50 risk of inheriting the disease allele from her mother has not been modified by the test.   D She is an asymptomatic individual who inherited an FMR1 premutation  allele and will likely develop symptoms of the disease if she lives long enough.   E She has inherited an FMR1 premutation allele. Although she won't be affected, her children might develop Fragile X symptoms.

Suppose that the price (P) and the number of bottles of champagne sold (B) are related by the following equation:  Determine the rate that the number of bottles of champagne is changing per week when the price of a bottle of champagne is $40, there are 50 bottles sold, and the price is decreasing by $2.00 per week. Complete the table:    P = [p] dP/dt = [dp]   B = [b] dB/dt = [db]    The (related rates) derivative is:  [deriv] The number of bottles of champagne is changing at a rate of  [rate]  [label].

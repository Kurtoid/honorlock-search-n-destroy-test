Alfred Adler proposed that older siblings, who start out as the focus of their parents' attention but must share that attention once a new child joins the family, compensate by becoming overachievers. The youngest children, according to Adler, may be spoiled, leaving the middle child with the opportunity to minimize the negative dynamics of the youngest and oldest children. Despite popular attention, research has not conclusively confirmed Adler's hypotheses about birth order.
All of the following are parts of the brain stem EXCEPT?
The following image shows an incident light beam in material 1 striking an interface with material 2. At this interface the light splits, with some (labeled "A") staying in material 1 and some ("B") entering material 2 at a sharper angle. After light B passes through material 2, it strikes another interface where it enters material 3 (as shown by "C") with a very shallow angle.    List all of the beams (incident, A, B, & C) in order according to the speed of the light in the beam. List them in order from highest speed to lowest speed, being sure to note which if any have the same speed.

A swim coach is trying to decide on whether or not to add pull-ups and calf raises to her strength and conditioning program.  She sees that the swimmers who can do pull-ups are also the fastest.  However, there is no correlation between the fastest swimmers and calf strength.  Calf raises have a greater transfer of training to swimming fast than do pull-ups.

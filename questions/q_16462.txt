Chocolate-covered crickets! Ant Egg Soup! Silkworm Fried Rice! And it's expensive--$25 for five crickets! I don't like the idea of eating insects. However, in many countries, insects are not expensive food, and people eat them every day. In Thailand, open-air markets sell silkworms and grasshoppers. Some movie theaters in South America sell roasted ants as snacks instead of popcorn.We all eat insects. "People eat half a kilogram of insects each year, but they don't know it," says Lisa Monachelli, director of family programs at New Canaan Nature Center in Connecticut. "For example, in the United States, chocolate can have up to 60 bits of bugs (like legs and heads) per 100 grams. Tomato sauce can have 30 fly eggs per 100 grams, and peanut butter can have 30 insect bits per 100 grams." Well, if I'm eating insects anyways ... I decide to order the chocolate-covered crickets. You know what? They taste good!       The restaurant in New York City is not cheap.

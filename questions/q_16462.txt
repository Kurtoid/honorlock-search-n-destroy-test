Consider a horizontal plate in a large enclosure. The plate is subjected to uniform irradiation on all sides as shown in the figure below. The ambient air temperature in the enclosure is [Tinf] K with a convection heat transfer coefficient of [h] W/m2 * K. The upper and lower surfaces of the plate have a radiosity of [J] W/m2 and the plate temperature is maintained uniformly at [Ts] K. Ignoring the ends of the plate and if the plate is not opaque and has an absorptivity of [alpha],  determine the emissivity of the plate. (Use the box below to answer this part of the problem) Can the plate be treated as a gray body. Give reasons for your answer.  Stefan Boltzmann Constant is  s = 5.67 x  10  - 8      W/m 2  [?]  K 4    Show all your work on the work upload (assumptions, schematics, analysis, etc.) document. Write down units in your equations.

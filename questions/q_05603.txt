Therefore, students cannot make up missed assignments unless they can provide verifiable documentation attesting to extenuating circumstances beyond their personal responsibility that have caused them to miss the posted deadlines.  Circumstances such as a verifiable medical excuse from a doctor, verifiable military service, or verifiable death of an immediate family member are examples of circumstances that warrant a deadline extension.  Connectivity, other computer type issues, personal issues, or any other issues that occur within the final day of online assignment availability are not valid reasons for a "reset" or deadline extension.  The instructor is the sole determinant of the validity of any student make-up request. To compensate for the no make-up policy, the course gradebook has been set to drop the lowest Discussion Forum grade, lowest SmartBook grade, and the lowest Test grade (Test 1 - 3 or Final Exam) for each student.

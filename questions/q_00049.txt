You now drop 250 grams of pasta (at room temperature) in the boiling pot of water.  By how much will the water temperature change? Assume this process is very fast. The specific heat of water is 4.18 J/g@C, and the specific heat of pasta is 1.80 J/g@C. (Remember to write down the energy balance equation.) How much time will it take to bring the water and pasta back to boiling? (Same power of the stove and same efficiency as in #1.) If you are not confident about your answer in 2a you may assume that the final temperature of water after dropping the pasta is 90.0 @C.
A drug that breaks the chemical bonds in mucus, thereby lowering its thickness, is a/an ________.
Figure 4 shows a circuit with seven scannable flip-flops (within the same clock domain), some are positive-edge triggered while some are negative-edge triggered.                 Submit everything on-line.             (a) Connect them into a single scan chain. You do not need to really design the details. Just give the scan ordering, e.g., A -> E -> F..... (b) Assume 700 test patterns are required to fully test the above circuit. How many test clock cycles are required? (c) If flip-flops (FFs) C and E have capture time violation during testing because of excessive clock skew. What should be done to fix this      problem ? (d) Assume circuit delays for CKT1 and CKT2 in Figure 4 are the same (e.g., 4 ns), and we compare the sensitivity to capture time violation      between FFs (C, E) and FFs (D, F). Which one is more sensitive? Give the reason. (e) If a lock-up latch is inserted between FFs C and E to fix the clock skew problem during scan mode, how many test clock cycles are      required due to the addition of this extra lock-up latch? Again, 700 test patterns will be applied.
Belinda is a 72-year-old Caucasian female referred to inpatient Rehab OT services with a diagnosis of left hip fracture caused by a fall while attempting to get out of the shower. Belinda is currently on WBAT with total hip precautions. She has a secondary diagnosis of hypertension and mild dementia. Belinda has Medicare insurance. She lives alone in a studio apartment, in a senior complex. She is a widow and a retired accountant, with no children, or immediate family. Belinda is very active in the activities offered at her apartment complex, especially the trips to the casino. She volunteers twice a month to serve meals at a homeless shelter. She does not drive; therefore, she depends on public transportation to go places. A home health aide visits Belinda three days a week for 4 hours to assist with housework and medical appointments. Belinda is afraid that she will be placed in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) and will not be able to live in her apartment anymore. She was referred to inpatient OT services to receive treatment for 2 weeks.   OT Evaluation Results:   *Belinda's goal: "be normal again" and to remain in her own apartment.   * Client to manage safely with community health support services.   * Cognition - mild impairment in STM; oriented to person, place, situation; minimal difficulty remembering time and dates   * Activity Tolerance - 3/5   * Sensory - intact.   * Ambulation - able to walk steadily for 30 feet with a walker and SBA   * Transfers - min to moderate assistance for household, toilet, and shower transfers; fearful to fall during shower transfers   * Bathing and dressing - independent with upper body; MIN to MOD assistance for lower body and peri-care   * Home management - MAX assistance at this time   By the beginning of the week, the COTA provided Belinda with moderate assistance to don/doff underwear and pants because of significant pain on the left hip. As the pain subsided, the COTA was providing less assistance by the end of the week. This is an example of _________.
The nurse is caring for a client following a left hemisphere (left-sided) CVA. Which neurological deficit would the nurse expect?

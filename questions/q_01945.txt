A 65-kg body 1 stays at one end of a 8.2-m-long and 15 kg board. A 35 Kg body 2 stays at one sixth (L/6) from the other end. Where should the pivot be placed so that the board is balanced? (Consider the Center of Gravity of the bar in the middle.)    Hint: in this exercises there is three torques related with three force of gravity (two bodies and the board). The torque is the weight times the distance to the pivot. Place the pivot wherever you want and assign a distance x from the body 1 to the pivot. Then express the distance from the point of action of the other two forces of gravities (board and body 2) to the pivot, by means of x.

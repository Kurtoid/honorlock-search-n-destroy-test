Mr. Zimmian is a 72 y.o. male who has been referred to you following a modified barium swallow study.  He has a profound hearing loss and uses ASL as him primary means of communication.  Mr. Zimmian is illiterate.  He had a left-hemisphere hemorrhagic CVA  1 month ago.  MRI reveals damage to the left frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.  Per case history, he exhibits difficulty with higher cognitive functions.  He also has mild receptive and expressive aphasia.  Patient was trialed with the following consistencies:  thin liquids (via cup sips), thin liquids (via straw sips), honey-thick liquids (via cup sips), puree, and soft solids.  No deficits noted in the oral phase for all consistencies.  Delayed initiation of pharyngeal swallow noted with collection in the valleculae prior to initiation of swallow with thin liquids.  Decreased hyolaryngeal elevation/excursion noted with all consistencies.  Reduced epiglottic inversion with all consistencies.  Increased residue on posterior pharyngeal wall with honey-thick liquids, puree, and solids.  Aspiration (no cough) after the swallow.        Based on the above case study, the patient is subjectively SAFE for PO intake of thin liquids and solids (standard diet) with minimal swallow precautions.

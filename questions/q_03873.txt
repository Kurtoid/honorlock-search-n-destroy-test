Use of unrelated code segments will result in deduction of points. It is possible to end up with negative points and reduce the overall  exam points. Assume all inputs are valid; no need to validate any input.  Do not include additional capability or functionalities other than what is asked for. Write a complete c program that will utilize three different functions (userInput,  merge and displayMerge) to fulfill the following requirements. The main function will  Call the userInput function to accept user input for the first string Call the userInput function to accept user input for the second string Call the merge function that will interleave the first string and the second string to produce a third string. The merge stops with the shortest string Display the user input strings Call the displayMerge function to print the merged string  Assume user inputs will not be longer than 20 characters. No spaces will be used. Use as many variables and arrays as needed. Size the arrays correctly. Do not use global variables.   Except for the output that depends on the user input, the heading Scenario, and the blank lines, all output (format and prompt) must match exactly what is shown here. Two different scenarios are provided to illustrate the different sizes of the user input string. Scenario 1 Enter string 1 : ABCD Enter string 2 : 123   Result String 1 : ABCD String 2 : 123 Merged string :   A A1 A1B A1B2 A1B2C A1B2C3   End of program   Scenario 2 Enter string 1 : 1 Enter string 2 : XYZ   Result String 1 : 1 String 2 : XYZ Merged string :   1 1X   End of program

Dalaba swings a small block of mass M = 5.0 kg in a horizontal, circular path on a frictionless surface from a spring. One end of the spring is fixed to the center of the circle and the other end is fixed to the block, as seen in the figure. The relaxed length of the spring is 25 cm, which then stretches to a total length of R = 30 cm during the circular motion. If Dalaba measures an angular speed of o = 3.5 rad/s, what is the spring constant for the spring k?

The graph below represents the distribution of molecular speeds for a gas at 4 different temperatures. Identify the distribution which represents the gas at the highest temperature.
Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr A 0.823 L sample of carbon dioxide, initially at 0.25 atm of pressure is compressed until it occupies only 93.2 ml.  If temperature remains constant, what is the final pressure, in mm Hg, of the gas? To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem. Show your work (equation/and units) by using the equation editor () in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use    to insert ratios. Be sure to include proper units and the final answer! Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

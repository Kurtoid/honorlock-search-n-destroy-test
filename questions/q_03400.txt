In the next room, she set up the tray on the bedside table which was not in reach of the patient and in the third room the patient was given the wrong tray. When the patient made the nursing aide aware it was the wrong tray, she took the tray out and delivered it to the right patient across the hall. At 12:30, all the trays were delivered and you take your guest tray to audit it. The tray is a pureed diet, temperature of the meat and vegetable were under recommendations for serving.

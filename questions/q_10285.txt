Some of the factors examined were weight, age, blood pressure, and national origin.  All of the participants in "Operation Snowdrop" were given a training course in how to survive and function in extreme cold.  At the conclusion, of the experiment, it was found that only two factors among those studied distinguished between personnel whose performance was rated as "effective" and those rated as "not effective" on the arctic exercises.  These factors were:  (1) the desire to participate in the experiment, and (2) the degree of knowledge and skill regarding how to live and protect oneself under arctic conditions.

In the context of social psychology, when assessing the cause of a behavior we tend to draw two types of inferences. We either believe a behavior can be attributed to a [att1], or internal, factor, or we believe the behavior can be attributed to a [att2], or external, factor. When it comes to assessing our own behavior, we are likely to attribute our failures to situational factors and our successes to dispositional factors. This is called the [bias1]. However, when we assess the behavior of others, we are much more likely to attribute it to dispositional factors. This is called the [bias2].

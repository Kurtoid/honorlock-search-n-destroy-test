"Hiring Those with Disabilities Isn't Charity, It's Good Business" Any time Bet-R Neighborhood Market owner Cliff Boulden has a job opening, he tries to hire a person with an intellectual or developmental disability--not as a sign of sympathy, but because he sees them as an untapped workforce that's eager to stock shelves and read labels. Boulden already knows many of them through his involvement with the Greater Baton Rouge Hope Academy, the alma mater of his 25-year-old daughter, Molly, who is developmentally delayed. After Molly aged out of the school a few years ago, Boulden hired her part-time as a way to keep her busy and focused. But since then, he's also brought on at least a half-dozen of her friends with special needs, who now comprise roughly 15% of his payroll... Larger grocery stores like Albertsons and Winn-Dixie are among many nationwide that have integrated people with disabilities into their dwindling workforce. As a small business owner, Boulden says he sees a greater payoff because the close-knit environment allows him to teach workers how to perform tasks other than bagging groceries, maximizing operational efficiency. Next, he wants to teach them how to use the cash registers. Boulden's recruiting practice comes as the unemployment rate for people with disabilities continues to fall nationally, dropping to 8% in 2018--the lowest it's been since the government started tracking the metric in 2007. However, the jobless rate for people with disabilities is still more than double the country's 3.8% unemployment rate, and they still run into challenges when searching for work.   Burkes, C.

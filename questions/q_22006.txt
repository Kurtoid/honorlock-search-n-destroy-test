6.  A University of South Florida biologist conducted an experiment to determine whether increased levels of carbon dioxide kill leaf-eating moths (USF Magazine, Winter 1999).  Moth larvae were placed in open containers filled with oak leaves.  Half the containers had normal carbon dioxide levels while the other half had twice the normal level of carbon dioxide.  Ten percent of the larvae in the containers with "high" (twice the normal level) carbon dioxide levels died, compared to 5 percent in the containers with normal levels.  Assume that 80 moth larvae were placed, at random, in each of the two types of containers.  Is there enough evidence to conclude that the higher carbon dioxide level is effective in killing a higher percentage of leaf-eating moth larvae?  (While answering the following sub-parts of this question, you will be including the null and alternative hypothesis, the test statistic, the p-value (a visualization and an interpretation), your statistical decision, and your conclusion in the context of the problem.) (c)  What area of the z-distribution should be shaded for the p-value in Step 3 of the hypothesis test?

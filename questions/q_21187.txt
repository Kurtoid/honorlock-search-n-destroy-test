A statistics instructor, who just happens to be a huge sports fan, wanted to know if there was a statistically significant relationship between points scored per game and assists per game for all-time great NBA players.  A sample of 5 Hall of Fame NBA players has been selected.  The data is listed in the table below.         Players   Elgin Baylor*   Jerry West*   Rick Barry   Michael Jordan*   Magic Johnson     Assists per game, x  4.3 6.7 5.1 5.3 11.2    Career PPG, y   27.4   27.0   23.2   30.1   19.5        Compute the value of the correlation coefficient (you may use your calculator).  Round the value to 4 decimal places.  Test the correlation coefficient for significance. Be sure to include your null and alternative hypotheses (including symbols - use the insert equation editor to do so),   If using the t-test: your t-critical value, your calculated t-test statistic, decision rule, decision, and conclusion.  The level of significance alpha, a = 0.05. If testing using table I, the statistically significant/critical value correlation coefficient, your calculated correlation coefficient, decision rule, decision, and conclusion.  The level of significance alpha, a = 0.05.   If applicable, find & interpret the coefficient of determination, R2. If applicable, find the linear regression equation. If not applicable, explain why it is not. If applicable, find the predicted career points per game for a player with a career average of 7 assists per game. If not applicable, explain why it is not. If applicable, find the predicted career points per game for a player with a career average of 10 assists per game. If not applicable, explain why it is not.

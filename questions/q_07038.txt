"The Crimea!* Once a flourishing and wealthy colony of ancient Greeks, a trade hub for Venetians and Genoese, a center of sciences and the arts! In time, however, it fell to the Mongols, became a haven for robbers, and, under the crescent flag of Islam, began to be a place where Christians were persecuted. Despite being rich in natural resources and blessed by a favorable geographical location and a mild climate, the peninsula grew poor, lost its significance, and became a threatening neighbor to the Christian kingdoms of the Caucasus, to Poland, and especially to Russia.

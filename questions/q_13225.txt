You may use the textbook for the class (Daniel A. Crowl and Joseph F. Louvar, Chemical Process Safety: Fundamentals with Applications, Prentice-Hall) and a calculator. You may only use your computer to access Canvas and your test through HonorLock. You may not use your cell phone or any written material other than the textbook. To maximize credit, show all your work, keeping track of units. Equations taken from the textbook must be written out and identified by equation number. Identify any assumptions made, and label intermediate results.  Points will be deducted for answers with excessive significant digits. Work out your solutions on paper, and type in your answers to each question in the boxes below.  Once you are done with your exam or when HonorLock closes, please scan and submit your work under the Exam #2 MakeUp assignment (it will be created after the HonorLock exam begins, to avoid confusion).   By typing my full name in the box below I certify that I understand that this is an open-book exam, that only the course textbook may be used as a reference, and that no other references of any kind are permitted. On my honor as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid for this exam.
The bar OA in the telescope adjusting mechanism shown below rotates at a constant angular velocity of o=9 rad/sec CCW.  All dimensions shown are in mm.   The instantaneous center of zero velocity of telescope AB at the instant shown is located at point [IC]. The angular velocity of bar AB is [wab] rad/sec and the velocity of point B is vB=[vB] mm/sec. The angular acceleration of bar AB is [aab] rad/sec2 and the acceleration of point B is aB=[aB] mm/sec2.  Important Note: Please use minus (-) sign for your answers to CW angular velocities and accelerations, and linear velocities and accelerations from right to left. Round all your answers to the nearest integer.

(3) (18 points) Consider a cantilever beam subjected to two moments with equal magnitude, M. The flexural rigidity of the beam is EI. Using the method of superposition, determine the deflection of the beam at the free end (x = L).
Which of these given arguments uses the fallacy of circular reasoning (or begging the question)?  [Answer] Argument A:    Proving:  For every real number x, x < x + 1.   Let x be an arbitrary real number. We know that 0 < 1. Adding x to both sides, gives x + 0 < x + 1.    And that gives the equivalent inequality x < x + 1. So for every real number x, x < x + 1.  Argument B:   Proving:  For integers x and y, if xy is a multiple of 5, then x is a multiple of 5 and y is a multiple of 5.  Let x and y be integers with xy a multiple of 5. x is a multiple of 5 means x = 5k, for some integer k. Similarly, y is a multiple of 5 means y = 5j for some integer j. Substituting for x and y, we get xy = (5k)(5j) = 5(5kj).  Since 5kj is an integer, the product xy, which equals 5(5kj), is a multiple of 5. So xy is a multiple of 5, when x is a multiple of 5 and y is a multiple of 5.  Argument C:    Proving: For every positive real number x, x + 1/x >= 2.  Let x be a positive real number with x + 1/x >= 2. Multiplying both sides by x, we have x2 + 1 >= 2x. So by algebra, we get x2 - 2x + 1 >= 0, or (x-1)2 >= 0. Since it is true that the square of any real number is positive, (x-1)2 >= 0 confirms that x + 1/x >= 2, for every positive real number x.  Argument D:  Proving:  For all integers m and n, if m and n are odd, then (m+n) is odd.  Let m and n be integers. We know that when m and n are even, then (m+n) is even. So if m and n are odd, (m+n) is odd.

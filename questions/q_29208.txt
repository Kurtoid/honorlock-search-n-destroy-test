Outline Congratulations! You have just been called for your second interview for a teaching position at the school of your dreams.  You will be meeting with the principal, the curriculum specialist, and the district reading coordinator.  They are going to ask you to describe ALL the important elements of effective reading instruction in the primary grades.  Use an outline format to organize your "talking points" that will guide what you will say during your interview.  Be sure to cover all you know about the fundamentals of early reading instruction, including why each is important and how they are integrated and supportive of each other, as well as other factors that impact implementation and pedagogy.  Your outline format should contain:  at least 4 major areas (I, II, III, IV, etc.)  at least 2 levels under each major area with 2 points under each level  (see example below)  you may add as many additional points, areas, and levels as needed to sufficiently outline your ideas you may organize your outline in whichever order makes sense to you  For example: I.          A.                   1.                   2.          B.                   1.                   2. II.          A.                   1.                   2.          B.                   1.                   2. ...and so on for at least 4 major areas I am only looking for an outline in this question.  Be as clear and specific as possible in explaining what you have learned this semester.  Use this opportunity to show me what you know about how to teach reading and convince me to give you a job!

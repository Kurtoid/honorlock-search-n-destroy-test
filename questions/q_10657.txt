A 10.0 g sample of white phosphorus, P4  was burned in oxygen and the product was dissolved in water to make 500.0 mL of solution. The reactions are given below. Calculate the pH of the solution at 25oC. The balanced equation for the combustion of white phosphorus in oxygen is: P4 (s)  +  5O2 (g)  -->  P4O10 (s) When the product is dissolved in water, the following reaction occurs: P4O10 (s)  +  6H2O (l)  -->  4H3PO4 (aq) For Phosphoric Acid: Ka1 = 7.5 x 10-3, Ka2 = 6.2 x 10-8, Ka3 = 4.2 x 10-13

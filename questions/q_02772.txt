A large experiment with 1495 participants was performed to test the effectiveness of a bacterial culture throat swab to diagnose a strep infection of the throat.  The results are summarized in the table.  Answer each of the following questions.            Test result is positive   Test result is negative   Subject is actually infected with strep bacteria                     325                         10   Subject is not infected with strep bacteria                         5                       1155      1.  If one of the test subjects is randomly selected, find the probability that the subject has a strep throat infection, given that the test result from the lab is positive.

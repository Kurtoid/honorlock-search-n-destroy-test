The nurse is assessing a client's eyes and has charted PERRLA. This charting acronym stands for:
Suppose that the required reserve ratio is 12%, currency in circulation is $650 billion, the amount of checkable deposits is $1150 billion, and excess reserves are $25 billion. **Round to three decimal places.** a) The money supply is $[dollars1] billion. b) The currency deposit ratio is [ratio1] c) The excess reserve ratio is [ratio2] d) The money multiplier is [multiplier] Suppose the central bank conducts an unusual large open market purchase of bonds held by banks of $1680 billion due to a sharp contraction in the economy.  Assuming the ratios you calculated in the previous steps are the same, the money supply should [change] (increase or decrease) to $[dollars6] billion.   Suppose the central bank conducts the same open market purchase as previously, except that banks choose to hold all of these proceeds as excess reserves rather than loan them out, due to fear of a financial crisis.  Assuming that currency and deposits remain the same, the new amount of excess reserves is $[dollars7] billion. e) The new excess reserve ratio is [ratio3] f) The money multiplier is [ratio4] g) The money supply is $[dollars10] billion.

Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr A sample of gas collected at 21.0degC and 0.868 atm, has a volume of 1.83 liters.  What volume will the gas occupy if the temperature is increased to 38.0degC and the pressure is reduced to 0.658 atm?  To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem.  Be sure to include the answer. Show your work (equation/and units) by using the equation editor () in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use    to insert ratios. Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

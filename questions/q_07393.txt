TryFit Co. uses process costing to account for the production of energy food bars. Direct materials are added at the beginning of the process and conversion costs are incurred uniformly throughout the process. The following are the costs to account for:       Equivalent units   Direct Materials   Conversion     Completed    8,000    8,000     Ending Work in Process    4,000    2,000     Total Equivalent Units   12,000   10,000             Costs to Account For:   Direct Materials   Conversion     Beginning WIP Costs   $7,000   $4,000     April Costs added   36,000   40,000     Total Costs to Account for   $43,000   $44,000       The conversion cost of units completed and transferred out using the weighted average method would be closest to:

An RN delegates to an experienced LPN/LVN the task of administering oral medications to a group of patients. The LPN/LVN accepts the assignment, and the RN knows that the LPN/LVN has had the training and has acquired the skills needed to complete the task. The RN then observes the LPN/LVN recording a patient's medication administration just before entering the patient's room. The priority intervention by the RN is to:
An adult patient was treated for a H. pylori infection 5 years ago. The NP suspects the patient has a recurrence of a H. pylori. The patient's medication list includes montelukast (Singulair) 10 mg oral daily, omeprazole (Prilosec) 20 mg oral daily, and lisinopril (Prinivil) 10 mg oral daily. The NP's next action is to:
Question 2. [35 points] Haier and Geli are two Chinese manufactures of home appliances that have merged. They have their own markets in Europe. Haier has plants in France, Germany, and Finland, whereas Geli has plants in the United Kingdom and Italy. The European market is divided into four regions: North, East, West, and South. Plant capacities (millions of units per year), annual fixed costs (millions of Euros per year), regional demand (millions of units), and variable production and shipping costs (Euros per unit) are as shown in the table below. a. Prior to the merge, if Haier sets an objective of minimizing the total costs while satisfying all market demands (no shortage), how should its network be structured (providing all plants remain open)?   [5 points] Define all the decision variables and cost parameters that you need to construct the model.  [10 points] Set up the optimization model and write down the mathematical formulation, including the objective function and all constraints.  [5 points] Solve the model in Excel and briefly describe the optimal solution you found.  b. [15 points] After the merge, how should the new network be structured to satisfy all market demands (no shortage), if the merged company sets the objective of minimizing the total fixed and variable costs? In this scenario, considering that plants may open or closed and that markets may receive products from one or more plants. Solve the model in Excel and briefly describe the optimal solution you found.

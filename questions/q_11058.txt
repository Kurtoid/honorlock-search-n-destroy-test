Select ONE of the possible two primary sources below and analyze it in 1-2 paragraphs.  Your response should include a reasonable estimate about when and where the source was produced, and it should also draw connections between the source and other themes and issues you have encountered via lecture, readings, and/or discussion.   Option A That is why I think it is important for you to know about Major Joppolo.  He was a good man, though weak in certain attractive, human ways, and what he did and what he was not able to do in Adano represented in miniature what America can and cannot do in Europe.  Since he happened to be a good man, his works represented the best of the possibilities. ...Therefore I beg you to get to know this man Joppolo well.  We have need of him.  He is our future in the world.  Neither the eloquence of Churchill nor the humaneness of Roosevelt, no Charter, no four freedoms or fourteen points, no dreamer's diagram so symmetrical and so faultless on paper, no plan, no hope, no treaty--none of these things can guarantee anything.  Only men can guarantee, only the behavior of men under pressure, only our Joppolos.   Option B Up to now, our policies have completely overlooked the political significance of naval power.  Yet if we want to go out into the world and increase our economic strength at sea, we will only construct a hollow edifice if we do not obtain a degree of naval strength.  If we go out into the world, we will find either existing interests or interests that will be claimed in the future.  These can make conflicts of interest inevitable.  Now that the prestige of 1870 has faded how can even the cleverest policies accomplish anything without real power that reflects the diversity of interests?  Naval power is the only politically versatile type of power there is and is why we will always end up getting shortchanged politically, even if there is no war. ...We currently have many ships that are obsolete or not seaworthy.  As soon as we have two to three modern squadrons supported by cruisers, as well as reserve material in this old fleet, the city on the Thames [London] will suddenly see [us] as a nation worthy of respect under all circumstances and in all matters.

Box m1 = 10 kg, slides on a horizontal table pulled by Box m2 = 4.0 kg, hanging over a pulley.  There is friction between box  m1 and the table, mk is not given.  Initially m1 is moving to the left with a speed of 5.0 m/s but the system comes to rest after moving d = 0.80 m.  How much work was done to the system by non-conservative forces?  Start with given equations.  Show all work.  (Remember, if m1 moves to the left a distance d to the left, m2 moves d upward.)

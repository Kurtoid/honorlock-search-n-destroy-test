Refer to the image below.  In the blank area below the image, type the following:   A: bone marking name B: bone marking name   You MUST type "A, B, C... etc" before each individual answer to get full credit.  For bone marking names, you do NOT need to give the name of the bone that the marking is on; you only need to give the name of the bone marking itself. You do need to give full names, however, to get full points.  For example, "olecranon" will only get you partial credit; "olecranon fossa" will get you full credit. Do your best with spelling.  Words spelled poorly will not receive full credit if instructor cannot identify the term based on how it is spelled.  Ignore the black lines that are not associated with a letter.  Each name is worth 1.5 points.

It is important to make child process print the parent process id. Otherwise, there will be no credits. #include #include #include #include #include int main(void) { /* Write your code below that creates a child process and lets the child process to print the process id of the parent process. Note that getpid() is the system call which you can obtain the process id of the running process */

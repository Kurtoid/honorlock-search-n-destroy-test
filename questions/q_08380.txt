Your image output should have a black background. (Note that blocks are present next to each other without any distance in between and every block has an interior 5 pixels thick black border).  n = input('Enter the number of base blocks n: '); Test Case 1: Enter the number of base blocks n: 1  Test Case 2: Enter the number of base blocks n: 2  Test Case 3: Enter the number of base blocks n: 3  Test Case 4: Enter the number of base blocks n: 5  Test Case 5:  Enter the number of base blocks n: 10

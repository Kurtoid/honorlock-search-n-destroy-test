Directions: Work all the problems below and upload your solutions, including your R code. Each of the problems below is worth 10 points. Problem 1. The lapse rate is the rate at which temperature drops as you increase elevation. Some students were interested in measuring the lapse rate and recorded the following data on a hike using a thermometer and a wrist altimeter.    elevation (ft) 600 1000 1250 1600 1800 2100 2500 2900   temperature (F) 56 54 56 50 47 49 47 45    (a) Draw a scatterplot with a regression line. (b) Find a 95% confidence interval for the lapse rate (the slope of the regression line) and interpret this interval. (c) Find a 95% prediction interval for the temperature at 2000 ft. Problem 2. The following table contains data on the severity of injuries sustained in car crashes.     Injury level     none    minimal    minor       major        Seat belt yes 12813 647 359 42   no 65963 4000 2642 303    The data is tabulated by whether or not the passenger wore a seat belt.  (a) Are the two variables independent? Perform an appropriate test and report your result. (b) Do you think that it would be possible to conclude from this data set that not using a seat belt causes a higher injury level? Justify your answer. Problem 3. A student wishes to find the proportion of left-handed people at her college. She surveys 100 fellow students and finds that only 5 are left-handed. Calculate a 95% lower bound confidence interval for the proportion of left-handed people at her college. Is there evidence that at least 2% of the students at her college are left-handed? Problem 4. For the mtcars data set (this data set is already loaded into R), perform a one-way analysis of variance of the response variable mpg modeled by cyl, the number of cylinders. Depending on your  method of analysis you may need to use the R function factor(), as cyl is stored as a numeric variable. State your conclusions.

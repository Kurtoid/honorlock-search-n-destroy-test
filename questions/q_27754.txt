Extra credit question (2 points; it shows as 0 points in this exam so that Canvas will not count it in the denominator, I will manually add up to 2 points as appropriate when grading so that it will show as extra credit). As we have covered earlier in the quarter, the influenza vaccine and many others you may have gotten typically consist of either proteins representing the pathogen, or an inactivated ("killed") or otherwise "attenuated" (harmless) version of the pathogen.  In response to the vaccine, B lymphocytes of your body produce antibodies that bind specifically to the protein or pathogen. This effectively "trains" your immune system to be able to rapidly and powerfully respond if you are exposed to the actual pathogen, thereby protecting you. A number of the new vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that is causing the global pandemic are instead RNA vaccines, meaning they consist of RNA sequences of genes from the coronavirus. For example, the one under development by Moderna is the RNA that codes for the viral spike protein, a protein on the surface involved in attachment and uptake by the cell. If classical vaccines rely on the injection of a protein in order for the immune system to respond to produce antibodies that bind that protein, what do you think the mechanism is of this RNA vaccine? In other words, how do you think this RNA vaccine elicits a proper immune response yielding antibody production that will bind and block the coronavirus, as clinical trials thus far have demonstrated it does? What do you think the antibodies bind to on the virus? Please explain briefly but clearly.

Inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN is common in prostate cancer.  The study of its role in cancer progression, however, has been hindered by the fact that a PTEN knockout is embryonic lethal.  Researchers have now developed a  Cre-Lox targeting vector to create a conditional KO mouse.  The diagram below shows the normal (wild type) PTEN locus, the targeting vector, and what the allele would look like if homologous recombination took place.      Explain the basic procedure by which the Cre-Lox targeting vector would help to overcome the embryonic lethality of inactivation of PTEN. (2) Explain one method by which you could determine if a mouse has the targeted allele as part of its genome.  Be sure to briefly describe how the method works AND be sure to explain the differences in results that would allow the researcher to distinguish between the wild type and the targeted alleles. (3)

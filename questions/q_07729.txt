Use the information below to answer the next 5 questions.  Your favorite fungus (because *everyone* has a favorite fungus, of course) called Shroomy favoritus is cultured on V-8 juice agar (yes, some fungi are grown on V-8 juice). The fungus is inoculated onto V-8 juice agar plates by putting a single fungal spore in the center of the plate, and the fungal colony spreads from the center to fill up the plate with mycelium. The diameter of the Petri dish is 65 mm.   You're identifying potential drugs to treat the respiratory disease caused by S. favoritus. Observations lead you to hypothesize that exposing the fungus to drug X will inhibit (slow down) its growth, which would make drug X a good candidate for further study.   To test this hypothesis you prepare V-8 juice agar with drug X (treatment), and without (control). You inoculate the fungus onto both media and measure fungal growth for 7 days. The results of one such are indicated in the graph below; the vertical error bars in the graph indicate that although there is some error in the measurements, the true diameter is likely somewhere in that range. The experiment is repeated three times with similar results.

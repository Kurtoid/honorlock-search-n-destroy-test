Super bugs   The species of bacterium called Neisseria gonorrhoeae infects humans, leading to the condition known as gonorrhea. Initially, gonorrhea was treated with a single antibiotic, penicillin. Although penicillin killed most genotypes of bacteria, a couple survived the treatment and passed on the alleles for their resistance to their daughter cells. Today, infections of Neisseria gonorrhoeae cannot be treated with penicillin, because most populations contain resistant genotypes. The figure below shows the process by which the population evolved resistance to the antibiotic.  Figure 1. Populations of Neisseria gonorrhoeae before and after selection for resistance to penicillin. The color of a cell indicates its level of resistance, ranging from low to high.    Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 6-10.   6. The process by which bacteria evolves antibiotic resistance could be viewed as natural selection.

Looking over a friend's CHM 2051 notes, Orphy was surprised to learn that hemoglobin of adults with sickle cell disease (HbS) varies from normal adult hemoglobin (HbA) by a change in only one amino acid in the two b chains of hemoglobin.  Individuals with sickle cell trait (inherited from just one parent) have one correct b chain and one incorrect. On chromosome 11 resides the gene that encodes for the b chain of hemoglobin; in humans with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease, a SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) of the codon from GAG to GTG causes a coding error from glutamic acid to valine. What would be the change in the sequence of the complementary codon on the other DNA chain?

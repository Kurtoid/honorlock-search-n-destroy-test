Problem 7: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Write a module that does a pulse width modulation coding for input serial x which is 8 bits wide. The output should be a 1 bit pulse (named pw) of length, in clock cycles, proportional to the value of x. (For instance if x = 3, pw should be 1 for 3 clock cycles and then  0.) Inputs should be x, clk (clock input), reset, and output should be pw which is 1 bit wide. Assume that x changes every 256 clock edges to the next value but is constant in between these changes. (hint: I wrote this using a counter which was compared to x, when less than x the module returns 1 for pw, when greater it should return 0 for pw.) Use System Verilog, don't use datatype reg, use always_comb and always_ff as appropriate for always blocks. Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables.

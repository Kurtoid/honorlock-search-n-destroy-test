Of the 402 people who did not get the vaccine, 68 people developed flu-like symptoms.    Here is a partially filled-in two-way table of the given information. You will have an opportunity at the end of the exam to upload an image of your work.  Vaccine    Received the vaccine Did not receive the vaccine Totals   Number of people who had flu-like symptoms 149 68 c = [c]   Number of people who did Not have flu-like symptoms a = [a] b = [b] d = [d]   Totals 1,000 402 e = [e]       Fill in the remaining values in the table (letters a, b, c, d, and e). Determine the proportion of all people who developed flu-like symptoms.

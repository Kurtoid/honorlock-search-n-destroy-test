The 45-year-old male patient was taken to the operative suite, placed on the table in the supine position and given a spinal anesthetic.  The right inguinal region was shaved, prepped and draped in routine sterile fashion.  The patient received 1gm of Ancef IV push.  A transverse incision was made in the intra-abdominal crease and carried through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  The external oblique fascia was exposed and incised down to, and through, the external inguinal ring.  The spermatic cord and hernia sac were dissected bluntly off the undersurface of the external oblique fascia exposing the attenuated floor of the inguinal canal.  The cord was surrounded with a Penrose drain.  The sac was separated from the cord structures. The floor of the inguinal canal, which consisted of attenuated transversalis fascia, was imbricated upon itself with a running locked suture of 2-0 Prolene.  Marlex patch, 1x4 in dimension, was trimmed to an appropriate shape with a defect to accommodate the cord.  It was placed around the cord and sutured to itself with 2-0 Prolene.  The patch was then sutured medially to the pubic tubercle, inferiorly to 2-0 Prolene.  The area was irrigated with saline solution, and 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine was injected to provide prolonged postoperative pain relief.  The cord was returned to its position.  External oblique fascia was closed with a running 2-0 Vicryl and Steri-Strips.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Sterile dressing

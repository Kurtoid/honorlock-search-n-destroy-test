Write essay answers to the following two questions;: 1.  Compare S. Lem's portrayal of artificial intelligence (e.g., the Governing Machine in "Twenty- Fourth Voyage" and the intelligent "Washing Machines" and Cathodius Mattrass in the "Washing Machine Tragedy") to P.K. Dick's in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.  What are some of the philosophical, ethical, and legal issues the authors bring up? Make some judgment of the tonal differences between the authors, as Lem is often ironic or satirical, and Dick more often has a tone of realistic or even epic seriousness.  2.

What are the sources of the appeal of the state (what is the state's positive version of itself?) and what are key sources of compulsion to conform to the state in each novel?   Be sure to include analysis of some main characters (Doremus Jessup and Buzz Windrip, etc., in Lewis; Adam Krug and Paduk, etc. in Nabokov) and an evidence-based analysis of key characteristics of the totalitarian state.

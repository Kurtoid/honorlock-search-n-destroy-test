You decide to use cotransduction frequencies to get an idea of the order of several genes (Gly, Met, and Erm). You will utilize strains containing the mutations glyP, metA15, and erm. glyP and metA15 prevent production of glycine and methionine, respectively, and the erm gene gives resistance to erythromycin. You grow a transducing phage on donor cells which are Gly+, ErmS, and Met-. Phage grown on these cells are used to infect recipient cells which are Gly-, ErmR, and Met+. (THREE PART ANSWER)  A.) What is the cotransduction freq. of Gly and Erm (show work)? (2pts) B.) What is the cotransduction freq. of Gly and Met (show work)? (2pts) C.) Based on those frequencies what might be the order of the markers? List 2 possibilities. (2 pts)

Credo company, with 2 million shares outstanding, is for the first time considering a payout in regular cash dividends of $0.25 per share starting in 1 year. Credo currently has $2 million in cash. The firm also pays annual interest of $150,000 on its debt and aims to maintain enough cash to cover it at any time. A stock analyst forecasts the following years' uncertain future cash flows of Credo company as follows. Scenario               Probability           FCF in 1 year           FCF in 2 years           FCF in 3 years Recession               10%                   -$2,500,000             -$3,250,000               -$4,550,000 Stable                      60%                     $800,000                 $1,000,000                $920,000 Boom                       30%                    $1,500,000              $1,250,000                $1,750,000 Which of the following statements are true? Ignore taxes. I. Credo will be able to cover both its dividend and debt payments through its cash holdings and internally generated expected cash inflows in the next three years. II. The market will react negatively to the dividend announcement because Credo will not be able to commit to the dividend over the next three years without costly external financing. III. To preserve investment capacity, it could be prudent for Credo to conduct a flexible buyback program instead of the regular dividend program. IV. Although the probability of a recession is low, the impact of a recession on free cash flow is large enough for expected financial distress costs to render the dividend program unsustainable.

DIRECTIONS: Choose the best answer for each question. Sextuplets [A] Most of us have met a pair of twins or triplets once or twice in our lives. But how many people know a set of sextuplets: six children born at the same time to the same mother? Not very many of us have. This is why the Dilley family is so famous.[B] Keith and Becki Dilley got married in 1986 and wanted to have children right away. After five years of no children, doctors gave Becki a special medication to help her get pregnant. It worked! But Becki wasn't pregnant with just one baby. She was pregnant with five - or that's what the doctors thought at first. [C] On May 25, 1993, Becki went to the hospital to give birth. The doctor delivered five healthy babies before Becki felt a sixth set of feet. The last Dilley baby, the sixth one, was quite a surprise. The babies had to stay in the hospital for several months. Some of them needed special machines to help them breathe. Others were so small and fragile that Becki and Keith could not hold them. After three months, the babies were finally able to go home.[D] Life in the Dilley household was quite busy, as anyone can imagine. There were six diapers to change, six bottles to prepare, six tiny outfits to wash, and so on. Thankfully, the Dilleys had family nearby who could help carry the load. Grandparents, aunts, and uncles all pitched in to help.[E] The sextuplets are grown up now. They have families of their own and work at various jobs. They seem to be just like other young adult, but they always have an amazing story to tell.What does the word fragile mean in paragraph C?

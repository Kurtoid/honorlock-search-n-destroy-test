If zero balls hit the target, you will lose a net of $2.  You win a net amount of $1 if you hit the target once, a net amount of $3 if you hit the target twice and a net amount of $5 if you hit the target three times. Define the Random Variable X = Number of times you hit the target, where the PDF is given by: P(X = 0) = 0.6 P(X = 1) = 0.2 P(X = 2) = 0.15 P(X = 3) = 0.05   Compute your expected winnings for each Skee-Ball game (in dollars $).  Round your answer to one decimal place.

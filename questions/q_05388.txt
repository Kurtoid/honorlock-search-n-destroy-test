For your final examination, you should write a cohesive, well-developed essay that fully addresses the essay prompt. Please closely read the following CQ Researcher articles (published October 17, 2014 (volume 24, issue 37)) and then the prompt below.     "Protecting the Oceans-Should the United States Open New Areas to Offshore Drilling: Pro"by Andy Radford, Senior Policy Adviser for the American Petroleum Institute   "Protecting the Oceans-Should the United States Open New Areas to Offshore Drilling: Con"by Deval Patrick, Governor of Massachusetts     par. 1The United States has a long and successful history of producing oil and natural gas offshore, but the federal government has largely chosen to restrict activity to the western and central Gulf of Mexico and select areas in Alaska. These restrictions keep 87 percent of federal offshore waters locked away--along with the potential to develop the vast energy resources they contain. par. 2The Interior Department will soon begin developing the government's next five year plan for offshore lease sales, which will take effect in 2017. Decisions made now will have impacts well into the future. par. 3Knowing this, the department should thoroughly analyze the resource-rich areas of interest throughout the entire U.S. Outer Continental Shelf and draft an expansive leasing plan that maintains current leasing areas and seeks to unlock new areas that are currently off-limits, such as the Atlantic and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Including these areas in the next leasing plan would send a signal to the markets and to the world that America's oil and natural gas renaissance is here to stay. par. 4Accessing this bounty is also safer now than ever before. In the last four years, the oil and natural gas industry has worked both independently and with regulators to enhance the safety of offshore operations. As the co-chairs of the [National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling] recently said, offshore development is safer today because industry and the government have enhanced spill prevention, containment and response, revised existing standards and regulations and created new ones and worked hard to foster a strong industry safety culture. par. 5The Center for Offshore Safety in Houston continues to work with companies and the regulators to ingrain safety culture even more deeply into day-to-day operations. And if an incident does occur, state-of-the-art well containment technology can now be rapidly deployed from strategically placed locations. par. 6America's oil and natural gas renaissance has nurtured our economy with good jobs, affordable energy and stable prices, but if we want these benefits to last for the long term, we cannot afford to make short-sighted decisions about our energy future.   par. 1Put simply: the search for and extraction of additional fossil fuels off our coast is inconsistent with Massachusetts' and the Northeast region's policy directions, our binding commitments to greenhouse gas reductions and our leadership in addressing climate change... par. 2Since 2009, my administration has been working closely with [the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] on the planning, siting and analysis of offshore wind in two areas south of Martha's Vineyard. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that these areas have the potential to generate more than 5,000 megawatts of clean, renewable wind energy--enough to power the majority of homes in Massachusetts. Our focus is on continuing this nation-leading work, and any potential exploration or development plans for oil and gas will present a significant distraction and curtail progress for an emerging offshore wind industry at a time when the U.S. is far behind many other nations. par. 3Finally, the waters of the Outer Continental Shelf off Massachusetts contain rich natural resources and important marine ecosystems and habitats that warrant strong protections. The potential impacts from oil and gas development and the calamitous effects of spills cannot justify the risk of moving forward with this industrial activity in the North Atlantic. The scallop and groundfish fisheries around Georges Bank are regarded as the most commercially important fisheries on the Atlantic coast and are critically important to the economies and social fabric of many coastal communities. The scallop fishery off Georges Bank has contributed several billion dollars to the Massachusetts and northeast regional economy in the last decade. par. 4Some of these fish stocks are under great stress. Further impact to the fishery would be devastating to an industry which has already seen enormous cutbacks resulting from federal catch limitations intended to rebuild the fishery. These ocean waters also contain critically important habitat for endangered whales, sea turtles and marine birds. par. 5In summary, Massachusetts does not consider the exploration or extraction of oil and gas off our coast as necessary for the Commonwealth's, the Northeast region's or the nation's energy future or in the best interest of the same. Instead, we need to be focusing our energies and efforts and committing national leadership to a sustainable energy future.     _____________________________________________________________________________________ Topic: Using the above-noted articles, "Protecting the Oceans-Should the United States Open New Areas to Offshore Drilling: Pro" and "Protecting the Oceans-Should the United States Open New Areas to Offshore Drilling: Con," as reference sources, write an essay in which you analyze each author's use of one rhetorical tool or rhetorical appeal to achieve his or her specific purpose.  To start, determine what you believe is each author's specific purpose.

You must choose both rhetorical tools and/or appeals from the following list:       allusions authorities/outside sources definitions description dialogue examples facts figurative language narration personal testimony/anecdotes scenarios statistics counterarguments concessions qualifiers organization voice appeal to logic appeal to emotion appeal to character appeal to need appeal to value       Organize your ideas into a four-paragraph essay that includes the following paragraphs: (paragraph 1) an introduction paragraph; (paragraphs 2 and 3) two separate, well-developed rhetorical tools and/or rhetorical appeals body paragraphs (one focused on the "Pro" author's use of your chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose and the other focused on the "Con" author's use of your other chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose); and (paragraph 4) a conclusion paragraph.

Werk met jou hande en laat die stres verdwyn Maandag / 29 Maart / 2021 Deur Wilma Bedford         1    Met die aanbreek van die inperking in Maart 2020 het baie mense hulle skielik in 'n nuwe daaglikse patroon bevind en selfs met te veel ure wat elke dag gevul moes word.         2   'n Interessante fenomeen wat te voorskyn getree het, is dat baie verveelde vroue en net so baie mans hulle na die kombuis gewend het om iets konstruktief en kreatief te vind om te doen.  Om 'n groot homp deeg te knie, het aan hulle 'n gevoel van kalmte en beheer verleen, selfs al het dit gevoel asof die wereld om hulle in duie stort.         3   Navorsing bewys inderdaad dat om in die kombuis te werskaf stresvermindering, beheer van emosies en selfs sosiale konneksies tot gevolg het. Om te bak en te kook, het gedurende die dikwels vervelige maande van isolasie 'n tipe selfsorg geword - en vir sommige selfs tot 'n nuwe, bevredigende en winsgewende loopbaan gelei.         4   Kreatiewe aktiwiteite kan sielkundige genesing in die hand werk. Klein, skeppende take kan ons gelukkiger laat voel en meer positiewe emosies opwek.         5   Susan Biali Haas, 'n dokter, skrywer en spreker, se ons gee ons brein 'n kans om te ontspan en te rus wanneer ons, ons hande gebruik om iets te doen wat nie van ons vereis om te veel oor enigiets te dink nie.         6   Sy verduidelik dat dit ook die brein kans gee om "agter die skerms" te werk.  Terwyl jy besig is om met jou hande te werk, ervaar jy dikwels 'n deurbraak in verband met 'n probleem waarmee jy lankal worstel of 'n idee wat sukkel om vorm aan te neem.  Wanneer jy met 'n taak besig is wat herhaling verg en dit dus jou gedagte heeltemal afsluit van die probleem of kwessie waarmee jy worstel, sal die oplossing dikwels uit die niet opduik.         7   Met die huidige wereldtoestand weens die Covid-19 pandemie en geen idee wat die toekoms inhou nie, laat die proses van bak of kook jou met 'n gevoel van skepping en voltooiing wat intens bevredigend kan wees in 'n wereld waaroor jy geen beheer het nie, voeg sy by.

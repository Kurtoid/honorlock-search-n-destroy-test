Each morning for the past 3 months a technologist obtains a field uniformity flood for 3,000 K counts. The technologist uses a 1 mCi Co57 sheet source to perform the flood. The average acquisition time is 49 seconds. The technologist could perform a statistical analysis in one of two ways. The first would be to reference a large number of data points (acquisition times from the log book). They could then look to see how many counting times fell within 1,2,3 standard deviations from the mean acquisition time. If the camera is working properly how many of the measurements out of 100 should fall between 42 and 56 seconds?

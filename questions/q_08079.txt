The diagram below represents possible results from the Meselson-Stahl experiment. Bacteria grown for many generations in medium containing 15N were transferred to medium containing 14N. DNA from these bacteria were analyzed by density-gradient ultracentriguation at zero, 1, or 2 rounds of DNA replication in the 14N medium, as indicated. The bands show the positions of the DNA in the centrifuge tubes. Density increases from top to bottom. Which of the experimental results shown above match the conservative model of DNA replication?

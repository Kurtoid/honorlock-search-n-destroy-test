QUESTION 2 - 5 Point In December 2018 Billy entered into a lease of a luxury apartment from Meadowlark Rentals.  The written and signed lease provided for a two-year lease term ending December 2020.  Under the lease, Billy was required to pay Meadowlark rent of $9,000 per month.  At the time, Billy could afford such a high rent payment because of his job as a successful realtor.  Unfortunately, the real estate market declined and Billy was having difficulty paying the Meadowlark lease.  Billy really liked his apartment and did not want to leave.  In December 2019 Billy approached Meadowlark about modifying the lease.  Billy offered to pay Meadowlark monthly rent in the amount of $7,000.  Meadowlark was not happy with this, but also did not want to lose Billy as a tenant because of the current market for luxury apartments.  Meadowlark agreed, in a signed written modification, to decrease the monthly rent to $7,000 in exchange for Billy agreeing to add one year to the original lease term so that the lease now ended in December 2021.  Billy agreed and both parties signed a written modification.  Billy began paying $7,000 per month.  In December 2020, Chris approached Meadowlark about renting Billy's apartment.  Chris offered to pay Meadowlark $10,000 a month for the luxury apartment.  Obviously, Meadowlark really wants to rent the apartment to Chris at this higher rent amount.  Meadowlark sent Billy a letter telling him that the modification was unenforceable and that the lease terminated on its original date in December 2020 because the modification lacked consideration.  Billy disagrees. REQUIRED (5 Points):  Who wins?  Explain.

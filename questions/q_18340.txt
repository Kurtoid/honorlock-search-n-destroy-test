A sociologist surveys 100 randomly selected citizens in each of two countries (Hillput and Gescu) to compare the mean number of hours of volunteer work done by adults in each. Among the 100 inhabitants of Hillput, the mean hours of volunteer work per year was 62, with a standard deviation of 10.3. Among the 100 inhabitants of Gescu, the mean number of hours of volunteer work per year was 59, with a standard deviation of 9.4. Using level of significance of 0.05, the sociologist wants to test the claim:   H0: Mean number of hours volunteered by all residents of Hillput and Gescu are equal. HA: Mean number of hours volunteered by all residents of Hillput and Gescu are not equal. Select all that apply to this situation.   The observed difference is  [value1], the standard error of the mean for Hillput is [value2], the standard error of the mean for Gescu is [value3], the standard error of the difference is [value4], the null difference is [value5], the z-observed is [value6], the p-value is [value7]. The sociologist [value8]. He has evidence to believe the mean number of hours volunteered by all residents of Hillput and Gescu are [value9].

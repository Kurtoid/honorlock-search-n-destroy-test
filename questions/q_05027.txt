Write a function called switch_data that takes as a parameter a pointer to a file containing a label followed by a sequence of integers and that prints to the console the same information with each successive pair of integers switched in order. For example, suppose that a FILE* called data contains the following tokens: Jan 1 2 3 4 5 6 Here the label is Jan. The label will always be a single word less than 15 characters long that appears at the beginning. After the label, we have a series of six integers. If we make the following call: switch_data(data); the function should produce the following output: Jan 2 1 4 3 6 5 Notice that the first pair of integers (1, 2) has been switched (2, 1), and the second pair of integers (3, 4) has been switched (4, 3), and so on. This first example involved sequential integers to make the switching more obvious, but this won't always be the case. You also shouldn't assume that you have an even number of integers. If there is an odd number of integers, then the final value should not be moved. For example, if the FILE* had instead contained these tokens: Feb 38 14 79 4 -3 then the function would have produced the following output: Feb 14 38 4 79 -3 There will always be a one-word label, but the list of integers might be empty, in which case the function simply prints the label on a line by itself. Your function should produce a complete line of output. In other words, if it is called n times, it will produce n lines of output. You may assume that the input is legal (a one-word label followed by 0 or more integer values). You may not construct any arrays to help you solve this problem.

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines developed to fight Covid_19 are a new generation of vaccines. Unlike traditional vaccines which generally involve injecting the body with weakened or inactive pathogen to elicit an immune response, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are RNA vaccines. In this case, messenger RNA (mRNA) that codes for the Covid_19 antigen is injected into the body. The mRNA is taken up into cells and translated into the antigen protein.   A. Consider a situation where a B-cell has translated the mRNA and now has antigen protein present. Explain, the process to produce antibodies against covid_19.     B. Later, if a vaccinated person was infected with the coronavirus, how would antibodies stop the virus from entering host cells. Be specific with the antibody action.

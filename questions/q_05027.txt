Unit 3 Case Study Summary.  A 22-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of respiratory failure. She was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia at age six and hospitalized for a sickle cell crisis at age 10. One month before admission, she had bilateral arm pain after jogging and went to a local hospital. Morphine sulfate, hydrocodone, acetaminophen, and fluids were administered, and the symptoms resolved. Two days before admission she experienced low back pain that radiated to her thighs and the back of her knees. The pain was constant and interfered with walking. She took ibuprofen that evening, which provided some relief. At 2 a.m., she awoke with increased pain and, four hours later, was seen in the emergency room of another hospital.  In the emergency room, the patient reported severe pain (10 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest level of pain and 10 the highest) in her back, thighs, and knees.  Chest x-ray revealed bilateral patchy opacities, suggesting pulmonary edema, as well as a partially collapsed lung. On physical examination, she was alert, oriented, and breathing normally. The blood pressure was 132/78 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the temperature 36.1degC. The oxygen saturation was 100 percent while the patient was breathing pure oxygen, but over the course of the next six hours, the oxygen saturation fluctuated, as did ventilation rate, and hemoglobin levels (Table 1). An echocardiogram revealed an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 52 percent (normal 55-70%), mild pulmonary insufficiency, and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 54 mm Hg (normal 15-25 mm Hg). The right ventricle was dilated, and the interatrial septum was stretched and displaced to the left, which was consistent with right heart overload. Aggressive therapy included a blood transfusion, packed red blood cell transfusion, pharmacologic manipulation to improve heart and lung function, and mechanical ventilation.  The patient had pulmonary emboli and developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  She was pronounced dead 23 hours after her admission.  The final diagnosis was sickle cell disease with acute chest syndrome, caused by infarction of the bone marrow and embolization to lungs.           1 hr post-admission   6 hrs post-admission     O2 -Hb saturation (%)   95   73     Hemoglobin concentration (g/dL)   5.6   8.4     Partial pressure O2 (mm Hg)   80   47     Partial pressure CO2 (mm Hg)   44   61     Mean arterial pressure (MAP) (mm Hg)   105   88       Adapted from case study: Case 17-2005.

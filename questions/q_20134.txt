Create an Alice 3 program that will do the following:   0.)  Define total problems & total correct at the scene level;        Also define cat total problems & cat total correct at the cat class level (you will see why in the summarize method.) 1.)  Add 3 cats on a mars2.)  Put the cats in an array3.)  a.)  Create a meow method in the cat-level, that will cause a cat to say "meow" while wagging its tail side to side 2 times  4.)  Create a subtraction method at the cat-level that will do the following:             1.)  Generate a random number between 1 and 10, and store in in ranNum1             2.)  Generate another random number between 1 and 10, and store it in ranNum2             3.)  Subtract ranNum1 and ranNum2 and save the answer in correctAnswer             4.)  Ask the user "what is the product of " + ranNum1 " X " ranNum2  and store the user's input into  a variable called userAnswer.              5.)  If the user's answer matches the correctAnswer, have the cat say "correct" and add 1 to a  cat-level variable called totalCorrect.             6.)  If user's answer is wrong, have the cat say "wrong" and nothing more.              7.)  Regardless, add 1 to a cat-level variable called totalProblems 4.)  Create a scene-level method called subtractionDrill, and call it from myFirstMethod. 5.)  Inside subtractionDrill method, use a for each in order to:        a.)  call the subtraction method once per cat.       b.)  call the meow method once per cat. 6.)  Create a scene-level method called summarize, and call it from myFirstMethod. 7.)  Inside the scene-level summarize method,        a.) Calculate the scene level total correct = cat1's total correct + cat2's total correct + cat 3's total correct;               Calculate the scene level total problems = cat1's total problems + cat2's total problems + cat3's total problems.        b.)  Have the first cat say what was the scene-level total correct  (scene-level getTotalCorrect)       c.)   Have the second cat say how many scene-level total problems were provided (scene-level  getTotalProblems ) 8.)   a.)   Compute the percent correct by dividing the total correct by the total problems (convert whole to Decimal) (multiply by 100)       b.)  Have the third cat say the percent correct.        c.)  Write an if-else-if statement that will tell the user how well they did on their subtraction facts:               90 or higher ----> Great Job!              80 or higher -----> Good Job.              70 or highter -----> Fair Job.              Less than 70 -------> Poor Job - Study More.    Here's the Rubric for this Program: rubricForCOP1000Midterm.docx

Problem 4 (8 points) - Graph Algorithms (Shortest Paths and Dynamic Programming) A map contains major cities and the highways between them. Assume the uniqueness of a highway directly connecting two major cities with distance information. (1) (1 point) Abstract this map as a weighted graph G with w; (2) (2 points) Describe (no pseudo code) an efficient algorithm to find the shortest distances from a given city s to other major cities. What is the time complexity? (3) (5 points) Dynamic programming technique can be used to find the shortest distances between any two major cities: (a) formulate the recurrence relationship of the shortest distances between cities   and  ; (b) write pseudo code to implement the recurrence relationship; and (c) analyze its complexity.

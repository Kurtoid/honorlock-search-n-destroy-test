As the unit manager, you post the staffing plan and compliance reports. This initiative is aimed at:
A study is conducted to determine if having a peer or alumnus mentor has an impact on the academic achievement of nursing students during their first semester. Incoming nursing students are recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups. Students in Group A (control) are not given a mentor, students in Group B are assigned a second-year nursing student as a peer mentor, and students in Group C are assigned a recent graduate as an alumnus mentor. At the end of the first semester in the nursing program, the grade point average (GPA) of each student is recorded. The researcher wants to account for differences in the natural academic abilities of the students, so the ACT score of each participant is also recorded. SPSS is used to create dummy variables for the groups. SPSS was then used to construct a regression model with dependent variable y= first-semester GPA and with independent variables x1= ACT score, x2= peer mentor and x3=alum mentor. Note that the dummy variable x2 is equal to 1 for students assigned a peer mentor and 0 otherwise; whereas, the dummy variable x3 is equal to 1 for students assigned an alum mentor and 0 otherwise. Use the SPSS output provided below to complete this problem.          Complete each of the tasks below. Clearly label your response to each part. Make sure you respond completely to each part.  Write the equation of the regression model. According to the regression model, if Rebekah is a first-year nursing student who has an ACT score of 24 and is assigned no mentor, what is her first-semester GPA expected to be? According to the regression model, if Rebekah had an ACT score of 25 instead of 24, how much would this change her expected first semester GPA? According to the regression model, if Rebekah were assigned a peer mentor instead of no mentor, how much would this change her expected first semester GPA? According to the regression model, if Rebekah were assigned an alumnus mentor instead of no mentor, how much would this change her expected first semester GPA? Based on the sample evidence presented in this problem, is there a statistically significant difference in Rebekah's expected first-semester GPA if she is assigned a peer mentor versus no mentor? Justify your answer.

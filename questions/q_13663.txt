Fig. 5(a) shows a static logic circuit containing 5 gates (including the inverter). Assume (a) the probability of assigning a logic 1 to each primary input is 0.5, (b) the load capacitances of gates X, Y, Z are C1, C2, C3 respectively, (c) the circuit operates with frequency f, and the power supply is Vdd.      (a) Calculate the dynamic power consumption for output loads (i.e., C1, C2, and C3) of gates X, Y, and Z using Equation 1 shown in Figure 5(b). (b) Calculate the short-circuit power consumption using Equation 2 for gates X, Y, and Z by assuming input slop tau for each gate. (c) Repeat (a) but the input probabilities are changed to P(a=1) = 0.3 and P(b=1) = 0.9. (d) Repeat (b) but the input probabilities are changed to P(a=1) = 0.3 and P(b=1) = 0.9.

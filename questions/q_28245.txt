Le 1er mai Read the description below about the holiday celebrated in France on May 1st and answer the questions in English. Le 1er mai est considere comme la journee internationale des travailleurs ou la fete du Travail.

Le muguet est le symbole du printemps et represente le retour de l'optimisme. Il est interessant de remarquer que l'administration fiscale autorise la vente du muguet aux travailleurs sans formalites ni taxes (without regulation or tax) le 1er mai. Dans le code du travail, le 1er mai est devenu un jour ferie et paye pour tous les salaries en 1947 mais c'est en avril 1948 qu'on adopte le nom officiel de <<fete du Travail>> en France.

You are shown DNA nucleotide base pairing to the right.  While you certainly aren't expected to have the chemical structure of each nucleotide memorized, you should be able to determine which nucleotide is which based  on your knowledge of base-pairing, the number of hydrogen bonds formed between the two pairs of nucleotides, and purines vs. pyrimidines.  With that in mind, label each DNA nucleotide with the symbol (A for adenine, T for thymine, C for cytosine, or G for guanine).

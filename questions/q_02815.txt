Read this text and answer questions 1-4. Norway is known as a democratic country. Its parliament is elected every four years and has 169 members. All citizens over 18 are automatically registered to vote. Voting is not compulsory, but nearly 80% of the electorate usually vote. In the UK, this figure is less than 70%, and in the USA, it is often below 60% of the electorate vote.   In Norway, there are several political parties who compete for people's votes. However, the parties are not focused on getting power for themselves, but instead work together to create policies that help the Norwegian people. This collaboration gives the people more power in the running of their country.   The population of Norway is almost 5.5 million, compared with almost 68 million in the UK. It is a rich country because it uses the profits from its offshore oil to help the country's finances. There is more financial equality in Norway than in most other countries due to a strong welfare state, higher taxes and entrepreneurship.   Norwegians feel a part of democracy because their voices are heard. They think of politicians as ordinary people who earn fair salaries and care about what happens to the country.

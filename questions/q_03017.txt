Let's compare two hypothetical complexes: CoL62+ is pink (light red) and VL62+ is lavender (blue-violet). L is a neutral ligand. These two complexes have the same number of unpaired electrons.  A. On your paper, draw a labeled orbital diagram for each complex, showing the electron occupancy, labeling each d orbital. B. Based on this evidence, is CoL62+ high spin, low spin or not applicable? [comp1]   C. Which complex has the largest crystal field splitting energy? [energy] Explain your answers in the work you upload.

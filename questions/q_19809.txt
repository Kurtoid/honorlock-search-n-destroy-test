Scores on the verbal portion of the GRE follow a normal distribution with a mean of 550 and standard deviation of 120.   A sample of size n=1 (yes, only one student) had a score of 650.   First, record the z-score associated with a score of 650 when n = 1. The z-score for 650 is [zscore].  Be sure to use a leading 0 and at least two decimal places in the z-score, like 0.12 and not 0.1 or .12   Second, determine the proportion (or percentage) of individual test-takers (n=1) that scored lower than 650. [proportion] Be sure to use a leading 0 and at least four decimal places in the z-score, like 0.1234 and not 0.123 or 0.12 or .1234

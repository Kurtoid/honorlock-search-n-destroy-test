A college entrance exam company determined that a score of 22 on the math portion of the exam suggests that a student is ready for college-level mathematics. To achieve this goal, the company recommends that students take a core curriculum of math courses in high school. Suppose a random sample of 200 students who completed this core set of courses results in a mean math score of 22.2 on the college entrance exam with a standard deviation of 3.9. Do these results suggest that students who complete the core curriculum are ready for college-level mathematics, i.e. are they scoring above 22 on the math portion of the exam? Conduct a test of hypotheses: a. Present the null and alternative hypotheses,  b. State the requirements of the test c. Explain which distribution you use and state the test statistic d. Find the P-value e. Clearly explain your conclusion at a level of significance of 0.10.

Consider the formation reaction shown using the metal Snapeium (symbol Sp) and monodentate ligand L: Sp+(aq)  + [n] L (aq)  SpL[n]+ (aq)  A solution initially has concentrations of Sp+ = 0.1[a]0 M and L = 0.0[b] M. When concentrations become constant the concentration of SpL[n]+ was found to be 0.0[c]0 M.       Calculate the formation constant, Kf. You must show work for full credit in your upload.

He asked Barney if he had been drinking and Barney admitted that he was coming from a Christmas party at his security firm and that the alcohol had been flowing freely. At that point Taylor advised Barney that he was also under arrest for driving under the influence. Taylor placed Barney in the back of the squad car. Taylor returned to Barney's car and searched the interior. Under the front seat Taylor found a gun. Taylor searched the trunk and opened several tightly rolled up paper bags and found marijuana.

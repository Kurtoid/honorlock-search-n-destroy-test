Consider the implications of adding a three-input addition, ADD3, to the MIPS ISA. This new instruction operates on registers only and performs the computation A = B+C+D.   (a) What are the two most significant changes to add such an instruction to a single-cycle MIPS datapath? (b) Beyond the two changes you listed for the single-cycle design, what are the two most significant additional changes to add such an instruction to our standard five-stage pipelined datapath (the number of stages is unchanged and ADD3 executes entirely in the "EX" stage)? (c) An alternative implementation would be to split the execution of ADD3 over two cycles ("EX" and "M", completing at the end of the "M" stage). Explain the potential performance advantage and disadvantage of such an implementation versus the implementation of ADD3 executing entirely in the "EX" stage. (d) Yet another way of implementing ADD3 would be by using micro-ops (as done in x86). What would be the key advantage and disadvantage of implementing ADD3 in this way?

Which of the following sorting algorithms are stable and which are not stable?  (Make sure to identify both types explicitly; omitted answers will be interpreted as "don't know" and receive no points.) For each algorithm that you denote as not stable, provide a counter-example. (1 pt per subproblem; Wrong answers will be penalized to discourage guessing).

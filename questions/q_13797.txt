A thin, uniform disk of mass m = 5 kg and radius R = 2 m is welded to a thin, massless rod. End A of the rod has a small, massless roller that slides in a frictionless horizontal groove as shown. The distance from roller A to the center of mass of the disk, C, is L = 5m. The system is released from rest in the position shown and gravity acts in the downward direction.    (a) Find the force P such that the body translates to the left with no angular acceleration if released from rest in the position shown. (b) For P = 100 N, find the angular acceleration of the disk and find the vertical reaction force exerted by the sides of the horizontal groove onto roller A when released from rest in the position shown.

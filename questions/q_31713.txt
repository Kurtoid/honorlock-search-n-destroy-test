McDonald's Waste Management purchased a new AN-109 industrial fryer used in industrial food preparation for $408,000 on January 1, 2017. The cost to install the industrial fryer was an additional $15,000. In late November 2019, the owner Mr. McDonald became aware of a new technology that offered many advantages (including some pretty cool dials and blinking lights) over the AN-109 fryer and decided to replace it. On December 31, 2019 the AN-109 was un-installed and sold to World Waste Recovery, Inc. for $200,000.

The United States International Trade Commission--an independent, nonpartisan federal agency headed by 6 commissioners--established a new policy on their website favoring trade with international suppliers that signed on to a new international Fair Labor Regime that included a commitment not to use child labor, slave labor, or forced labor.  The regime included quarterly inspections by certified independent consultants.  The agency has the authority to conduct both rulemaking and adjudications pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act and the Trade Act of 1974.  The policy was based on a unanimous vote of the commissioners.  Based on its enabling statute the Commission has the authority to promote trade practices that "further the interests of the United States."  If Multinational Company challenges the new policy in court as exceeding the agency's authority under the statute which of the following would be true:

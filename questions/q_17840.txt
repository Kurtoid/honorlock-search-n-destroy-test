Consider a glass window that is L = [L]-m-high and w = [W]-m-wide with a thickness of [t] cm having a thermal conductivity of [k] W/m*K, and emissivity e = [e]. The room and the walls that face the window are maintained at [Tinf]degC, and the average temperature of the inner surface of the window is measured to be [Tsi]degC. If the temperature of the outdoors is [Tinfo]degC, determine  the convection heat transfer coefficient on the inner surface of the window the rate of total heat transfer through the window the combined natural convection and radiation heat transfer coefficient on the outer surface of the window. Is it reasonable to neglect the thermal resistance of the glass in this case?     Show all your work on the work upload (assumptions, schematics, analysis, etc.) document. Write down units in your equations. Solve symbolically and plug in numbers at the end.

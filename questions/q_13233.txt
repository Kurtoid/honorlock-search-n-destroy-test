18) [Note: make sure you read the whole question, since although it's similar to one of the study questions, it is not exactly the same.]  A magistrate is faced with a very real threat coming from an angry mob demanding a culprit for a crime.  Unless a criminal is immediately produced, promptly tried and executed, the mob will certainly take their revenge on a small and vulnerable group in the community.  In that event there is sure to be a massacre with many innocent victims.  The magistrate knows that the identity of the real criminal is unknown and that the police have no clue how to go about finding him.  He knows that there is a man, a shiftless character who is universally disliked in the community, whom he knows to be innocent of the crime but could be easily framed so that the mob is very likely to be convinced of his guilt.  By framing this individual the magistrate is reasonably confident that he could avoid the killing of large numbers of innocent people.  What answer do you think Mill would give to the question what the magistrate should do?  How would Mill defend his answer?  Explain.  (Important: You should explain both how the act utilitarian and how the rule utilitarian would answer.)  What answer do you think Kant would give to that question?  How would he defend his answer?  Explain.  Which view do you find more appealing?  Briefly explain.

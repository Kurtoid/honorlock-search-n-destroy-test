In Project 1, you used the circuit shown below, where Rth represents the resistance of a thermistor.  Consider the potentiometer is adjusted such that the node voltage V+ = 2.5 V.     a) If at room temperature, Rth = 11 kOhm, then the node voltage V- is [voltage], and the LED would be [state1].   b) If the thermistor is substantially heated, it's resistance will [change], and the LED would be [state2].

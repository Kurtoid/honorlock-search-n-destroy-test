The hypothesis that men in high stress jobs have an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease was tested during an 18-year follow-up study from 2000-2017 of a group of 8,000 men of Japanese ancestry in Hawaii.  Of the 4,500 men with higher stress jobs, 3,000 of them developed CHD; of the 3,500 men with lower stress jobs, 1,800 of them developed CHD. All 8,000 men completed the CHD examination at the end of study, 3,200 were free of prevalent coronary heart disease (CHD), while 4,800 had incident CHD (there was no loss to follow up).           Disease             Have CHD   No CHD         Exposed ( high stress jobs)   3000   1500   4500     Not exposed (low stress jobs)   1800   1700   3500     Calculate the cumulative incidence of CHD for those unexposed to higher stress jobs:

Part 2. The following 8 short essay questions are designed to evaluate critical thinking/reasoning skills.  You do not need to answer all of the questions.  What you need to do is choose 2 the following questions to answer on the attached sheet of paper (correctly number which questions you chose). If you answer more than 2 questions, only the 1st two will be graded. (5 pts. each) 1) Mountains will form at oceanic-oceanic, oceanic-continental, and continental-continental boundaries.  Each area has unique characteristics that result in certain types of mountains.  Pick 2, briefly discuss how the mountains form, and what is different between the two boundaries. 2) Briefly discuss how temperature, confining pressure, time, and rock type all affect the way rocks will deform.  (Hint: Do not forget that these factors can be interrelated). 3) Briefly describe how water affects mass wasting.  Your answer needs to go beyond just saying that water increases weight. 4) Provide at least three examples of how humans can increase the probability of mass wasting and how those events increase the chance. 5) Velocity, gradient, and discharge all affect a streams ability to do "work".  Pick two and describe what their effects are on streams. 6) Since dams and levees are useful for trying to control flooding, why is it then that they are sometimes controversial and considered to do more harm than good? 7) What causes the subsidence that sometimes accompanies groundwater use? Why is it important to be knowledgeable about subsidence? 8) How can limestone be dissolved by groundwater when it is almost insoluble in pure water? How does this happen?

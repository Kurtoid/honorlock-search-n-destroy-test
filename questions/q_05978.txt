The following study vignette relates to questions 32-33. A social work researcher, Graciela Ortiz, with a strong interest in ecology and environmental justice hypothesizes a connection between access to community green spaces and time spent outdoors on the one hand, and symptoms of stress and depression among urban dwellers on the other hand.  Examining data from a crossectional  large-scale population study, Dr. Ortiz discovers a significant inverse relationship between symptoms of stress/depression and access to and use of green spaces. Encouraged by this finding, Dr. Ortiz develops a study to test out a program consisting of outdoors/nature activities (Natural Me Program) for adults in a low-income, diverse community in Milwaukee who screen as having mild or moderate depressive symptoms. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Which of the following describes the process when researchers build on their more preliminary research findings to develop and test more rigorous (e.g. explanatory) hypotheses?

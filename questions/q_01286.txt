Credo company, with 1 million shares outstanding, is for the first time considering a payout in regular cash dividends of $0.2 per share starting in 1 year. Credo currently has $600,000 in cash. The firm also pays annual interest of $50,000 on its debt and aims to maintain enough cash to cover it at any time. A stock analyst forecasts the following years' uncertain future cash flows of Credo company as follows.     Scenario   Probability   FCF in 1 year   FCF in 2 years   FCF in 3 years     Recession   10%   -$500,000   -$450,000   -$550,000     Stable   60%   $20,000   $25,000   $20,000     Boom   30%   $200,000   $300,000   $250,000       Which of the following statements are true? Ignore taxes.    Credo will be able to cover both its dividend and debt payments through its cash holdings and internally generated expected cash inflows in the next three years. The market will react negatively to the dividend announcement because Credo will probably not be able to commit to the dividend over time without costly external financing. It would be prudent for Credo to pay out a smaller dividend or conduct a flexible buyback program instead. Although the impact of a recession on free cash flow is large, the low probability of a recession implies that concerns of financial distress costs should be minimal in impacting the payout decision.

Estimate the population size based upon the following data:                  - Number of animals marked (during first capture) - 100                 - Total number of animals captured (second capture attempt) - 200                 - Number of animals recaptured (marked in second capture) - 25                 - Average (from experimental data) percentage of "marks" lost between captures - 10%                   POPULATION SIZE (nearest "whole" animal):________________

Consider a game in which Jack has a choice between A and B, and Jill has a choice between Y and Z, and their payoffs for each combination of actions is in the table below.     Jack chooses Jill Chooses Payoff to Jack Payoff to Jill   A Y 5 2   A Z 3 1   B Y 6 3   B Z 4 4    Suppose they play game in which each player has one move. Jack chooses first and Jill chooses second. What is Jack's course of action that would net him the highest payoff (assuming that Jill always responds with the choice that nets her the highest payoff)?

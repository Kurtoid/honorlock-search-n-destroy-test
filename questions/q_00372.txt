An Atwood machine consists of two masses, connected by a string, hanging over a massless, frictionless pulley as shown.  There are no additional forces. What is the maximum acceleration that can be seen in this system?
Using the kinematic bicycle motion model, a robot R1 starts at pose P (location and orientation) and travels a distance D using a fixed steering angle A.  Location is defined by the center of the rear axle.  D is measured from the rear axle of the vehicle.  Assume A and D are both positive values.  We then swap out robot R1 for another robot R2 which is twice the length of R1.  R2 starts at pose P (location and orientation) and performs the same action using A and D.   If we know that R1 traveled less than a complete circle, which of the following statements is true?

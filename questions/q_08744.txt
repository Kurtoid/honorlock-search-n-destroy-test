They write the following on a legal pad: "On this 12th day of September, 2021, Chad and Tara agree as follows: Chad will make coffee for Tara every morning and serve it to her in bed.  In exchange, Tara will edit Chad's resume anytime he looks for a new job." The two are satisfied that this will really do a lot to strengthen their marriage and they both sign.  The following day, Chad and Tara are talking over their contract and orally clarify that Chad has to bring Tara two cups of coffee each morning in bed.  Tara is dismayed a week later when Chad only brings her one cup of coffee and decides, in addition to leaving him since she can no longer trust him, that she will sue for breach of contract.  Under the Parol Evidence Rule, Tara will be permitted to testify that she and Chad orally agreed to the 2-cup of coffee rule the day after they had signed their written contract.

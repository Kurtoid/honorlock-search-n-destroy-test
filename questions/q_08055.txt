Researchers Webb, Cambell, Schwartz, and Sechrest (2000) wanted to measure patrons' interest in museum exhibits when there were no patrons around to observe. One measure they used was looking at the number of nose-print marks on the glass of certain exhibits, presumably thinking that the more nose-prints, the more interest. Which of the following best describes this research approach?
In class we discussed an experiment where researchers compared germ free mice colonized with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt)  to germ free mice colonized with Bt and Methanobrevibacter smithii (Ms).  The figure below shows transcriptomics data from this experiment, where red indicates the gene was upregulated in mice with Bt/Ms and green indicates that the gene was down regulated in mice with Bt/Ms.     Where are organisms expressing fructofuranosidases and fructokinases likely located in the gastrointestinal tract?  Explain your answer.  Why would the upregulation of these enzymes result in weight gain for the mice?
Assume we are using quicksort to sort an array in ascending order. What can we conclude about the indexes of two pivot elements placed in consecutive recursive calls?

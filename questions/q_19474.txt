Question 3 (12 points): Casting The objective is to cast a spherical metallic object of diameter 10 cm. Two different casting processes are being considered: sand casting vs die casting. The sand mold can be broken safely when the solidified shell is at least 10 mm thick. However, the metal molds can be opened only after full solidification of the object. The process parameters are listed in the table below. Answer the following questions. Show your work and provide justifications.     Process   Time to fill (s)   Chvorinov's constant (s/cm2)     Sand casting   25   100     Die casting   10   2       (a) Assuming the sphere cools evenly, how much time must transpire after pouring the molten metal before the sand mold can be broken? (4 pt) (b) How long will it take for the sphere to fully solidify inside the metal molds? (4 pt) (c) Which process should one choose to minimize the chances of defects and to maximize throughput? Explain. (4 pt)

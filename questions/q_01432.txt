Problem 3. (10 points) A cantilevered steel shaft with circular cross-section is subjected to fluctuated load of F = 0~375 N. The stress concentration factor and notch sensitivity factor are 1.75 and 0.67 respectively. The ultimate tensile strength of the shaft is 533 N/mm2. The yield strength in tension is 400 N/mm2. The endurance limit for the testing specimen is 400 N/mm2. Determine the diameter of the shaft, d, when the surface finishing, size, and reliability modification factor are given as 0.85, 0.8, 0.897, respectively.    Write down the obtained diameter.

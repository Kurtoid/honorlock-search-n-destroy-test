A particle with mass and charge m=7mp{"version":"1.1","math":"m=7mp"} and q=+3e{"version":"1.1","math":"q=+3e"} is accelerated from rest through a potential difference. Once it has passed through this region of space it enters a different region of space which contains a uniform magnetic field of 450 mT. When the particle moves in this magnetic field it moves in a circular path with an effective radius of 35.0 mm. What is the magnitude of potential difference that made this possible?

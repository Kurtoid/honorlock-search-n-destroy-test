When a voltage difference is applied to a piece of metal wire, a 3-mA current flows through it. If this metal wire is now replaced with a silver wire having twice the diameter of the original wire, how much current will flow through the silver wire? The lengths of both wires are the same, and the voltage difference remains unchanged. (The resistivity of the original metal is 1.68 x 10-8 O * m, and the resistivity of silver is 1.59 x 10-8 O * m.)

Fran, a fifteen year old high school student, is very intelligent and musically gifted. She enjoys school, but has begun to be late daily. Although she gets up at 5 a.m. she spends much of the morning getting ready. She takes a very long shower and changes clothes until she "feels right." This behavior may take more than an hour. She packs and repacks her book bag until it is "right". She leaves home but has to pause three minutes on each step, repeating a mantra to herself, "I will do well today. I will make good grades. I will be successful." She continues counting her steps to school and repeats her ritual until she gets to her first period class, often making her late. What is her possible diagnosis?

For your final examination, you should write a cohesive, well-developed essay that fully addresses the essay prompt. Please closely read the following CQ Researcher articles (published December 2, 2011 (volume 21, issue 42)) and then the prompt below.     "International Adoption-Should International Adoption Be Promoted: Pro"by Stevan Whitehead, Vice President of the Overseas Adoption Support and Information Service   "International Adoption-Should International Adoption Be Promoted: Con"by Rupert Murray, Former European Adviser on Children's Welfare for Romania     par. 1Without a doubt, children need early, permanent, stable, nurturing parenting in order to flourish. This right to a family is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Yet, millions of children worldwide are denied this fundamental right: 2.2 million children worldwide are in orphanages, and more than 150 million are living on the street, according to UNICEF. par. 2Equally without question, adoption provides the best form of substitute parenting. That's why in Western countries we do not shut down entire adoption programs just because there may be occasional instances of scandal and abuse. The benefits of adoption far outweigh the risks. Only in international adoption do breaches of the law by fraudsters, profiteers or traffickers result in the wholesale closure of adoption programs and the condemnation of children to institutional care or life on the streets.   par. 3British and U.S. laws already exist to penalize those who commit serious adoption abuses. Where laws don't exist, they should be created, but they should be used wisely. Equal care should be given to the efficacious regulation of all adoptions in order to address real problems and avoid counterproductive moratoria and over-regulation. par. 4Closing international adoption without having a viable alternative in place punishes unparented children--whether they are orphans or victims of abuse or neglect. par. 5Adoption comes from harm and loss, but it is intended to prevent greater continuing harm by providing a nurturing, therapeutic family environment. When one considers the lack of success in finding social interventions that significantly improve children's lives, the proven positive impact of adoption should be applauded and promoted. Thus, to ensure that children retain their right to a family and protection from the detrimental effects of multiple placements, foreign adoption should be part of a spectrum of services to children, including family support and preservation, reunification with relatives and domestic adoption.   par. 1I live in Romania, which was once one of the big sending countries in the international adoptions business: More than 30,000 Romanian children were sent abroad for adoption between 1990 and 2001. In Romania, and I suspect in all the "sending" countries, the lobby for international adoptions is highly effective in persuading the government and media that this is a solution to their child-welfare problems. The adoption lobby doesn't advertise, but it does offer generous commissions to politicians, journalists, lawyers, judges, social workers, medics and others who facilitate this secretive and highly profitable business. par. 2In the chaos following Romania's violent revolution in 1989, adoption agencies were able to facilitate deals with directors of children's homes, medics in maternity hospitals and poor families in villages. The minimum price for a child was about $30,000. I recently asked the Romanian government for information about these cases, and they said there are no records for those who were sold between 1990 and 1997. par. 3The international adoptions business is built on a false promise. Decent families in the United States are told they are giving a home to orphans and abandoned children. In reality, the demand for children far outstrips the supply of orphans, and the result is kidnapping and fraud--in countries with weak legal systems that can be easily corrupted. par. 4A series of court cases in China revealed how the business operates there: Babies are snatched from the arms of mothers in one province and "abandoned" at an orphanage in another. The charity Against Child Trafficking, based in the Netherlands, is helping to pay the court costs for poor families in Ethiopia and India who were tricked into declaring that they had "abandoned" their children, who were then sold into the international adoption system. par. 5When Romania's government discovered how unaccountable the business was (each child disappeared without trace), it banned international adoptions in 2001. All this will be undermined if international adoptions are reintroduced in Romania--and there is constant pressure to do so. International adoption should not be promoted. It should be banned.     _____________________________________________________________________________________ Topic: Using the above-noted articles, "International Adoption-Should International Adoption Be Promoted: Pro" and "International Adoption-Should International Adoption Be Promoted: Con," as reference sources, write an essay in which you analyze each author's use of one rhetorical tool or rhetorical appeal to achieve his or her specific purpose.  To start, determine what you believe is each author's specific purpose. Choose one of the following specific purposes for each author: to convince, to justify, to validate, to condemn, to expose, to incite, to celebrate, to defend, or to question. Then, determine which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Pro" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose and then which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Con" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose. You must choose both tools and/or appeals from the following list:    alliteration amplification allusions analogy arrangement/organization authorities/outside sources definitions diction (and/or loaded diction) enthymeme examples facts irony paradox parallelism refutation rhetorical questions statistics testimony tone logos pathos ethos kairos     Organize your ideas into a four-paragraph essay that includes the following paragraphs: (paragraph 1) an introduction paragraph; (paragraphs 2 and 3) two separate, well-developed rhetorical tools and/or rhetorical appeals body paragraphs (one focused on the "Pro" author's use of your chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose and the other focused on the "Con" author's use of your other chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose); and (paragraph 4) a conclusion paragraph. Your essay must include a forecasting thesis statement and effective topic and concluding sentences in each body paragraph. At least four times in your essay, you also must correctly integrate quotations, paraphrases, and/or summaries from the above-noted articles; remember to include proper in-text citations.

Explain in detail how muscle attaches to bone.  Please use specific tissue names.  Incorrect spellings will not count against you as long as I can phonetically read your explanation.  :-)  The tendons of muscles are made of dense regular CT proper--full of collagen fibers.  The periosteum around the bone is made of dense irregular CT proper--also full of collagen.  The bone itself is (not surprisingly) full of collagen.  The collagen of the tendon weaves together with the collagen of the periosteum.  The periosteum sends collagen fiber bundles (Sharpey's fibers) down into the bone to interweave with that collagen.  All this collagen linking strongly anchors the muscle to the bone.

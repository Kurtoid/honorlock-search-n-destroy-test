You ask for clarification of how much he eats. "Well last night for instance, I had a bad day at work and went by all my favorite take-out places. Got two large meat lover pizzas, four Sonic double cheese burgers and fries, then to Kroger for a gallon of cookie dough ice cream. I ate all that with a two liter coke. I was so stuffed. I didn't want to but my gut revolted and I puked and pooped till I thought I might have to go to the emergency room. So this morning, I decided I wanted to stop this before I exploded my gut." You clarify whether Bob purges regularly, but Bob states that he thinks he really made himself sick the other night and this was a very rare occurrence.

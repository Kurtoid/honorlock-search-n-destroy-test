The total cost of reaching consumers (C) depends upon the number of consumers (N), advertising costs (A), and transportation costs (T). The linear cost prediction model is represented as: C = c - nN + aA + tT  where c, n, a, and t are constants and c estimate the total cost when the remaining variables are zero. Which of the following interpretations is true about this model?

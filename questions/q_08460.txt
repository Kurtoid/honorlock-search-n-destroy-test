A United States Forest Service ecologist periodically sampled plant biodiversity on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, between the years 2000 and 2012, during a 1212-year period of drought, to determine the relative abundances of native hardstem lovegrass versus nonnative fountain grass.  (a) Explain what the trend in relative abundance of native hardstem lovegrass and the invasive fountain grass over  the 1212-year period implies about each species' ability to withstand drought conditions. (b) Based on the data in the graph, the Forest Service decides that Integrated Pest Management (IPM) should be used to remove the nonnative fountain grass from Mauna Kea to protect the native hardstem lovegrass, following an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach. The ecologists want to begin their IPM program with physical control in a managed 10-hectare plot of the forest. Design a controlled experiment that will test the effectiveness of their physical control measures on removing the invasive fountain grass within the 10-hectare plot. (c) After four years of physical control efforts, the ecologists evaluate the abundance of each type of grass in the test plot. They discover that, although there is less fountain grass in their test plot than when they began, there has not been a significant increase in native hardstem lovegrass. Assuming the ecologists wish to continue with an IPMapproach and continue their removal efforts on the test plot for another four years, explain one modification that could be made to the experiment you identified above that could alter their results.

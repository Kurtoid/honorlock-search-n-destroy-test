(Treat all values given as having 3 significant figures.)  Box m1 = 5 kg having initial velocity v-1i=4 m/s x^+ 0 m/s y^{"version":"1.1","math":"v-1i=4 m/s x^+ 0 m/s y^"} collides with box m2 = 8 kg having initial velocity v-2i=-6 m/s x^+ 3 m/s y^{"version":"1.1","math":"v-2i=-6 m/s x^+ 3 m/s y^"}.  After this partially inelastic collision, box m2 has final velocity v-2f=0 m/s x^+ 0 m/s y^{"version":"1.1","math":"v-2f=0 m/s x^+ 0 m/s y^"}. a)  Find the final velocity of box m1.  Leave your answer in component form. b)  Find the impulse put on box m2 during the collision.

Risk assessment studies subject animals to lifetime exposure to a fixed amount of a toxic chemical. The lifetime risk probability is estimated as a frequency (th) at a chemical dose (d). The data on the exam Excel file under the tab "Exam1-Q3&4" are liver cancer responses of five animal groups fed a daily dose of DDT (synthetic insecticides). Based on our empirical knowledge, the relationship between the lifetime risk probability (th) and the chemical dose (d) can be modeled as th = 1 - a* exp (-b*dg) If a is 1, b is 0.1, and g is 0.5, what is the square error (SE) between the actual and the modeled th for the FOURTH (4) group of animals?

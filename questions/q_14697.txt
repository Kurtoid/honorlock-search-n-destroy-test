The Sea Level Bank has Gross Loans of $1 billion with an ALL account of $85 million. Two years ago the bank made a loan of $12 million to finance the Sunset Hotel. Two million dollars in principal was repaid before the borrowers defaulted on the loan. The Loan Committee at Sea Level Bank believes the hotel will sell at auction for $7 million and they want to charge off the remainder immediately. If the Sunset Hotel sells at auction for $10 million, how this will affect the pertinent balance sheet accounts?

Stain Removers (Canvas Q11~13, Handwritten Pages Q11) Background: Proteases are a type of enzyme that break down large protein molecules into smaller pieces. These enzymes are most familiarly found in our saliva and gastric juices to help break down and digest the protein in the food we eat. One specific bacterial protease, subtilisin, has been modified by bioengineers to be usable in more general conditions: engineered subtilisin variants are found in modern laundry detergents, dishwashing detergents, and contact lens solutions to help remove stubborn stains more easily than with just the cleaner alone. Question: A bioengineering company is interested in improving the efficiency of the subtilisin cleaning reaction. The head researcher has engineered a modified subtilisin form that is highly effective for cleaning contact lenses, and wants to explore this variant further. Experiments indicate that a single molecule of this subtilisin variant has a mass of 3.[mass] x 10-20 g. What is the molar mass of the engineered subtilisin? (Additional 4 points) On your Handwritten Pages, show all of your work and box your final answer. ( Q11 ) Type in only the numerical portion of your answer, properly rounded to the correct number of sig figs, here. (Note: Canvas will automatically insert a comma if your value is greater than 1000. Your work, however, should NOT include comma separators!)
Consider the following audio player class that can play or record audio from a file. Note that a file must be open in order for operations to be performed on it. For brevity, we have not included the actual implementation of the functions but only the code relating to the current state: public class Mpeg { private final static int CLOSED = 0; private final static int OPEN = 1; private int state; public Mpeg() { state = CLOSED; } public void open() { assert(state == CLOSED); state = OPEN; } public void play() { assert(state == OPEN); } public byte[] record() { } public void close() { assert(state == OPEN); state = CLOSED; } } Consider each of the below six tests as a unit of input to Randoop. Answer whether that test can ever possibly be generated by Randoop. If yes, explain whether Randoop 1. Discards the test as illegal, or 2. Reports the test as a bug, or 3. Adds the test to components for future extension. For simplicity, assume that Randoop does not check for redundancy, and that the contracts it checks (not shown for brevity) are standard ones (e.g., equals and hashCode).    Test Can ever be generated? If yes, what outcome?    Mpeg m = new Mpeg();m.play();  [test1]    Mpeg m = new Mpeg();m.open();m.close();m.play();  [test2]    Mpeg m = new Mpeg();m.open();Byte[] o = m.record(); if (o.length == 0) m.close();   [test3]    Mpeg m = new Mpeg();m.open();m.play();m.close();  [test4]    Mpeg m = new Mpeg();m.close();m.play();  [test5]    Mpeg m = new Mpeg();m.open();m.play();m.close();Byte[] out = m.record();   [test6]

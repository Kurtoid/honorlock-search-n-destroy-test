Dr. Gallimore calculates a correlation coefficient for the Final Exam scores in Statistics to see if they are related to the Final Exam scores in Research Methods for a group of n = 100 college students. The Final Exam scores in Statistics have a mean of M = 95 with SS = 900, and the Final Exam scores in Research Methods have a mean of M = 30 with SS = 1400, and SP = 240. What percentage of the variance is accounted for by the relationship between the Final Exam scores in Research Methods and Statistics? Hint: I am looking for the effect size of a correlation.

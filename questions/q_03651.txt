Given #47 and if we assume heritably is interpreted more in the narrow sense (epistatic interactions and dominance effects do not matter - we are looking as specific alleles), what was the measurable response to selection in the next generation?   I have repeated #47 below incase you need it: The total variation of tooth length in a particular type of fish is 0.6. Through common garden experiments biologists have figured out 0.2 of the variation was due to environmental factors. What is the general broad-sense heritability (H2)of tooth shape in these fish

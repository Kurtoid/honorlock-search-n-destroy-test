Crayfish Approximately 10,000 years ago a population of crayfish entered a cave. Though initially indistinguishable from crayfish that live on the surface, today the cave crayfish do not develop eyes and have longer antennae that provide an improved sense of smell. By manipulating their embryos in the lab, it is possible to produce cave crayfish with eyes. When the cave crayfish with and without eyes are placed into a dark, cave environment, they show no difference in survival and reproductive success. When investigating crayfish genes that play a role in the development of the sensory nervous system, it is discovered that a gene known as sense1 is active at higher levels in the embryos of cave crayfish than in embryos of surface crayfish. When the level of activity of sense1 is artificially increased in embryos of surface crayfish they develop without eyes and with long antennae.

A 5.0 kg box is attached to a horizontal spring, k = 1800 N/m, on a frictionless horizontal surface to form a mass and spring oscillator.  a)  The box is initially displaced a distance of xa,max =  0.40 m from equilibrium and released from rest.  What is the speed of the box at a time when the displacement of the box is 0.12 m from equilibrium? b)  The mass and spring system is reset.  The box is initially displaced a distance xb,max and released from rest.  It is found that the total energy in the system is 3 times what it was in part a.  Find the maximum speed, vb,max of the system.

2.3   Die onderstaande gevallestudie handel oor die probleem van eutrofikasie in 'n ekosisteem. Lees dit aandagtig deur en beantwoord die vrae wat volg:   Ekologiese gevolge van eutrofikasie (Gevallestudie: Eutrofikasie en dooie sones)   Inleiding Dooie sones is suurstof arm gebiede (hipoksie) in die oseaan waar seelewe, insluitend visse, krappe en mossels, nie kan oorleef nie. In die 1970's het oseanograwe/ mariene bioloe begin let op toenemende gevalle van dooie sones. 'n Studie van 2008 het 405 dooie sones wereldwyd getel. Hipoksie is 'n natuurlike verskynsel wat gereeld in kuswaters regoor die wereld voorkom. Gedurende die afgelope 50 jaar het die toename in belangrike besoedelingstowwe van menslike aktiwiteite op land egter baie kusekosisteme uit balans gebring, wat gelei het tot uitgebreide streke vir dooie sones. Die verbruik van skulpvis (bv. Mossels, oesters) uit hierdie dooie sones is een van die mees algemene maniere waarop gifstowwe van alge die gesondheid van die mens kan beinvloed. Die gifstowwe veroorsaak dat iemand onbevoeg raak weens die verlammende effek van die gifstof en kan veroorsaak dat die persoon sterf weens verlamming van die longe. http://www.coastalwiki.org/wiki/Case_studies/eutrophication

In the lower part of its valley, the Ausable River in upstate New York is about 40m wide. Under typical early summer conditions, it is 2.2m deep and flows 4.5 m/s. Just before it reaches Lake Champlain, the river enters Ausable Chasm, a deep gorge cut through rock. At its narrowest, the gorge is only 3.7m wide at the river surface. If the flow rate in the gorge is 6.0 m/s, how deep is the river at this point? Assume that the river has a rectangular cross-section, with uniform flow speed over a cross-section. (10 pts)

Lymphadenopathy cannot be detected without a biopsy.
To establish a persistent infection, viruses evade many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity. Examples of viral immune evasion strategies are described below. For each strategy, please state whether virally-infected cells (i.e. the 'target cell') would be killed by: i) virus-specific CTLs and/or ii) NK cells, and explain why target cell killing by these lymphocytes would or would not occur, for these responses do not consider ADCC reactions. Write 1-2 sentences each part, using the format below (you just need to write A, B, and C and i and ii. A) HIV often harbors mutations in the sole viral epitope presented by MHC class I, resulting in loss of viral peptide binding to the MHC I.  i) Virus-specific CTLs: ii) NK cells:  B) Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes a protein called US3 that binds to MHC Class I molecules and retains them in the ER, so that they are never presented on the cell surface. i) Virus-specific CTLs:  ii) NK cells: C) Poxviruses encode a protein called crmA, which can inhibit caspases 3 and 8. i) Virus-specific CTLs:  ii) NK cells:

Here is an argument by analogy. We should not blame the media for deteriorating moral standards. Newspapers and TV are like weather reporters who report the facts. We do not blame weather reports for telling us that the weather is bad. Which of the following are the a's (the old ways in which the example is like the target)?The diagram for an analogy is on the final exam handout.

Purple loosestrife, Lythrum salicaria, is a beautiful, long-stemmed wetlands species brought to the United States from Europe as an ornamental plant. In the United States, it has no predators and crowds out cattails, Typha latifolia, another wetlands plant that's a valuable resource for many species. What type of organism would Purple loosestrife be considered?

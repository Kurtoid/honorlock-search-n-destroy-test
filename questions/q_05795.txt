Use the answer bank below to answer the questions unless its a number then just type that in (make sure its a whole number, no decimals.)   Cardiac output is calculated by [37] (37) x[38](38). So if EDV = 100 ml and ESV = 50 ml and the heart is beating 100 times per minute what is cardiac output:[39] (39: put in the number in L/min). Stroke volume is determined by 3 things: the amount of blood in the heart before contraction called: [40] (40) and measured by: [41] (41), the pressure the left ventricle has to overcome to get blood out called:[42](42) and measured by [43](43), and the force of contraction called:[44](44) and measured by [45](45). During exercise venous return increases drastically due to increased muscle pump this would lead to an increase in which volume: [46](46). The strength of heart contraction is controlled by [47](47) which causes more [48](48) to flow into cardiac myocytes leading to [49] (49) which leads to a stronger contraction. This increase in contraction strength increases stroke volume by decreasing [50](50: cardiac measurement).       A. End diastolic volume   E. Systolic blood pressure   I. Afterload   M. Parasympathetic nervous system   Q. Ca++     B. End systolic volume   F. Contractility   J. Heart rate   N. Somatic nervous system   R. Stronger action potential     C. Ejection fraction   G. Stroke volume   K. Aortic stenosis   O. Na+   S. More actin/myosin interaction     D. Mean arterial pressure   H. Preload   L. Sympathetic nervous system   P. K+   T. More filling time

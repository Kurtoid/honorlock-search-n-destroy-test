To help inform their decision, a team collected data on the size of several natural areas, the number of charismatic species each contained (butterflies, birds, and plant), and the "value" that visitors associated with the habitat. Use the correlation matrix below to identify the pairs of variables with the highest correlations to inform the development of the conservation plan.           value   area   butterfly   bird   plant     value   1.0                       area   0.36   1.000                   butterfly   0.35    0.14    1.000              bird   0.71   0.59   0.69    1.000         plant   0.41    0.29    0.65   0.24    1.000     Which pair of variables is most highly correlated?

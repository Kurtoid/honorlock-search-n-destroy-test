Use the following information to answer the question.Giardia intestinalis can cause disease in several different mammalian species, including humans. Giardia organisms (G. intestinalis) that infect humans are similar morphologically to those that infect other mammals, thus they have been considered a single species. However, G. intestinalis has been divided into different subgroups based on their host and a few other characteristics.In 1999, a DNA sequence comparison study tested the hypothesis that these subgroups actually constitute different species. The following phylogenetic tree was constructed from the sequence comparison of rRNA from several subgroups of G. intestinalis and a few other morphologically distinct species of Giardia. The researchers concluded that the subgroups of Giardia are sufficiently different from one another genetically that they could be considered different species. (T. Monis, et al. 1999. Molecular systematics of the parasitic protozoan Giardia intestinalis. Mol. Biol. Evol. 16[9]:1135-44.)According to the phylogenetic tree in the figure above, G. intestinalis constitutes a ________ group.

Parent Co. acquired 70% of Subsidiary Co. on January 1, 2021. During 2021, Parent made several sales of inventory to Subsidiary. The cost and sales price of the goods were $150,000 and $220,000, respectively. Subsidiary still owned one-fourth of the goods at the end of 2021. Consolidated cost of goods sold for 2021 was $2,280,000 due to a consolidating adjustment for intra-entity transfers less intra-entity gross profit in Subsidiary's ending inventory. How would consolidated cost of goods sold have differed if the inventory transfers had been for the same amount and cost, but from Subsidiary to Parent?

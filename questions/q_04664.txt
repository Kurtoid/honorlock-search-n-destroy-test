Problem 1 (30 points) The beam AD, loaded as shown, has vertical reactions of 46 kN at point A and 64 kN at point D.  Determine the shear force and bending moment as functions of position.  Then, draw the shear (V) and moment (M) diagrams.  Make sure to identify the values of the shear and moment at the extremes of the beam, at points where the loading changes, and at points where they are maximum or minimum.  Label regions that are non-linear as quadratic or cubic, and indicate the slopes at the start and end of those regions.      Enter the following values as evidence of your work.  You may need to calculate other values as well. Format:  Enter functions of x, as requested.  Use the carat symbol ^ to denote exponentiation.  For example, V(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5 represents that V(x) is a quadratic function with coefficients of 3 and 2 in the quadratic and linear terms, respectively, and with a constant of -5. For region

Through the course of his work, Mendel was led to assume that a single phenotype was affected by a single character. We have, however, identified a number of phenotypes that may be controlled by multiple genes. The pelt color in mice, for example, is either brown, black, or brown and black. A second gene determines if that pelt color will be expressed. The relationship between these genes is an example of which of the following?
A finger stick WBC count on a 20 yr old female is performed by diluting the blood and a standard hemocytometer to count the cells. 20 microliters (uL) of blood was diluted with 1.98 milliliters (mL) of diluent. 200 platelets were counted in 1 square measuring 1mm x 1 mm on one side of a standard hemocytometer. Hemocytometer depth = 0.1 mm. Calculate the platelet count.
John wants to sell his car and tells his cousin, Kelly that he will take $5,000 for it.  Kelly doesn't want it, but Leon is listening to their conversation and says he will buy it for $5,000.  John and Leon have a contract.

An electron relaxes from the n = {x} energy level to the n = {y} energy. Calculate the energy, in Joules,  associated with this energy transition. If the transition is exothermic be sure to include the appropriate sign. Use the equation: [?]E = -2.18x10-18 J 1n2f-1n2i{"version":"1.1","math":"[?]E = -2.18x10-18 J 1n2f-1n2i"} ------------------------------- This is for administrative purposes only.

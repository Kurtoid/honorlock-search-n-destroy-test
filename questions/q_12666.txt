Photo ID Procedure      In 2004, the Boston police department introduced a new procedure for showing photos of suspects to eyewitnesses. At that time, the department learned that at least eight people tried in Boston courts during a ten-year period had been wrongly convicted of crimes based on mistaken identifications from eyewitnesses. They hoped that the new guidelines would reduce the number of mistakes.      Under one of the guidelines, eyewitnesses view photos of possible suspects one at a time rather than looking at a group of photos on a single page. Studies show that when eyewitnesses view photos in a group, they compare the faces and often pick out a photo that is similar to the person they last saw. However, if an eyewitness views the photos separately, he or she is less likely to compare them, and therefore, makes fewer mistakes.       Under another guideline, the officer who shows the photos will not know who the suspect is. In the past, officers who were aware of the suspect may have led witnesses toward a particular result. For example, if the witness pointed to a photo of the "wrong" suspect and said, "I think this is the person," the officer might look doubtful and say, "Are you sure?" As a result, the eyewitness might make a second guess and look for another person to identify. However, if the officer is unaware of the suspect, he or she will not be able to influence the result.      Finally, another guideline says that police can't pressure an eyewitness to make a choice. Police usually tell the eyewitness at the beginning of inspection that the suspect may not be among the photos. Sometimes, an emotional witness will feel under pressure to identify someone. The police officer must not add to that pressure by showing impatience or by creating the feeling that someone must be chosen.   1. The Boston police department wanted to improve the way they identified suspects. [a1] 2. In 2004, Boston courts wrongly convicted ten people based on incorrect identification. [a2] 3. Eyewitnesses now view photos of several suspects grouped on one page. [a3] 4. Eyewitnesses sometimes compare photos and pick out a face that is similar to the last one they saw. [a4] 5.

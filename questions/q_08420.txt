2. (7 pts) Tides are the periodic rise and fall of sea levels. The height of a tide is measured in feet above an average low. Suppose a site in the Puget Sound has a high tide of 11 feet and a low tide of 2 feet and changes sinusoidally. The tide completes one cycle in 12 hours. The high tide occurs at noon.  a) Write a function f(t) that gives the height of the tide in feet where t is the number hours after noon. b) A particular beach site for digging clams is only accessible when the tide is 5 feet or below. Find the approximate times that this beach is accessible. Give your answer as the number of hours past noon rounded to the nearest hundredth. You don't have to convert an actual time.

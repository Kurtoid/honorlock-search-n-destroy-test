READ COMPLETELY: Please click on the link below to access the exam questions. A pdf will open in a tab, window, or pdf-reader app (such as Adobe Acrobat Reader). Work out the solutions to the questions on your scratch paper and upload your work to the Canvas assignment "Upload Test #1 pdf of your work" using the Genius Scan and Canvas Student app, as previously discussed, and with Honorlock recording this procedure.  This must be completed by 2:35 p.m., therefore start setting up for your upload no later than 2:25 p.m., which is 10 minutes before the Honorlock exam window closes. Finally, after uploading your work to Canvas, indicate by clicking on one of the four choices below how you submitted your work, and click Submit Quiz to complete the exam. Then, and only then, you are permitted to close Honorlock. Contact Honorlock via live chat if you have any issues with it during the exam. Contact me via Canvas mail (ONLY) during the exam if you need a clarification about an exam question or procedure. There is no guarantee, however, that I will receive your email soon enough, and be able to respond to your question, before the exam window closes, although it is my intent to try to do so. Just continue answering the exam questions as best as possible. Since the exam questions are self-explanatory and the procedures are the same as for the required Practice Exam that you already took, and you have practiced the uploading of your work with the two required apps, there should not really be a need to contact me during the exam. This option is to be used only if there is something very unusual that you detect or experience. It is not for an emergency of any kind, nor for something requiring an emergency response from me. [As always, call 911 if you are having a medical emergency.]  Click on this link to open the exam: TEST#1 MAP2302_SUMMER_2021.pdf

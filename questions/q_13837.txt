After completing the multiple-choice portion of your final exam, read the following case study and follow instructions in the Your Assignment section below.  Type your responses in the box on screen.  The case study portion is worth 90% of the Final Exam.  The multiple-choice portion is worth 10% of the Final Exam. Background Finimore Crabapple III is one of the brightest electrical engineering students at State University.  Finnie was valedictorian of his high school and won a National Merit Scholarship and a summer research assistantship at Livermore Laboratories in California.  During his three years at State, Finimore has been an exceptional student--creative, thorough, and unquestionably gifted in the area of artificial intelligence and science/engineering in general.  After he graduates in May, Finnie plans to attend Stanford, where he was one of the finalists for a prestigious $30,000 per year award that Stanford gives to outstanding students who are interested in pursuing doctoral work in science.  Finnie wants to complete his Ph.D. and then do research at one of the university research foundations, such as the one at Cal Tech.  Because he did well at Livermore Laboratories, he says he would like to work there, where research is conducted like any business operation.  Finnie is definitely not interested in teaching, just research and publication with a research organization. Finnie is now planning to register for his final semester at State.  He approaches the associate dean of the engineering college, Martin Weeks, who is also chief advisor for the college.  Finnie asks Dr. Weeks if he can be excused from taking technical writing, which is a required course for all engineering students at State.  Finnie tells Dr. Weeks that he wants to take a superconductivity elective, taught by a visiting professor, and that he cannot do so if he has to take technical writing.  Finnie takes 18 hours every semester, but he says he just can't take 21 and do every single required assignment in technical writing and his final senior project.  Finnie does not want to risk making a "B," as he wants to be sure that he graduates summa cum laude in May. Finnie was very persuasive.  Finnie showed Dr. Weeks several creative writing awards he has won since high school.  He publishes poems in the student literary magazine and has published three short stories in popular magazines.  Last year, for example, he published a Christmas story in Family Circle.  Finnie also reminds Dr. Weeks that he has made no grade less than B+ on any lab report he has written at State.  Finnie says that several of his professors say that his lab reports are very clear.  In short, Finnie does not believe he has any writing problems.  In high school, he took nothing but honors English courses.  When he was a senior in high school, he won the essay writing contest at the state UIL meet. The Problem Dr. Weeks calls you, as you direct the technical communication program at State, and asks you what you think.  You can tell from Dr. Weeks' voice that he sounds unsure of the merit of asking you for an exemption for Finnie.  Dr. Weeks tells you that many employers have told him and written to the Dean, Dr. Norman Overton, that State's engineering students have shown strong improvement in writing skills since technical writing was made a degree plan requirement five years ago.  Dr. Weeks says he knows that Finnie has never worked a day in his life, as he has been immersed in study since he was a small boy.  Dr. Weeks says he thinks that Finnie has little idea of how much or what kind of writing scientists do in an organization.  Dr. Weeks comments that he worked at Pacific Bell Laboratories for 10 years before he decided to return to university teaching.  He says he holds the job he has because Dean Overton believes that the head of advising for an engineering college needs to be someone who "knows the ropes" in academe and the outside world. You tell Dr. Weeks that people like Finnie are the kinds of people who need technical writing the most and that his creative writing is not the kind of writing he will be doing as a member of a research foundation.  In addition, Finnie needs to learn strategies for writing articles for publication. Dr. Weeks says he agrees with you and that it is against his policy to excuse anyone from technical writing.  However he asks you if you would write a report--in the form of correspondence--explaining why technical writing is important.  He will show it to Finnie and any other student who asks for an exemption. Before the end of the conversation, Dr. Weeks says he would like to be able to show your report to several of Finnie's professors who think that "the kid is being hounded to take a course he doesn't need."  At least two of these professors have never worked outside the university and think that "good writing is good writing.  Because Finnie can obviously write well, why make him waste his time in the English department, where he placed out of Freshman English?" Your Assignment As best as you can, carefully format your responses to the following:  List the four functions of correspondence.  How do they apply to the document Weeks requested? Who are the primary and secondary audiences of the document Weeks requested? What types of documents are used for correspondence?  How is each appropriate (or not) for the document Weeks requested?  After answering these questions, write the document that Dr. Weeks requested, using your name as the author.  Play the role appropriate for this context.  Please use one of the formats we discussed in class.  Include all elements of the document you choose, inventing any details (such as addresses) if necessary.

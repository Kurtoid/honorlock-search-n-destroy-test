Some people point to the US current account deficit. But most people do not understand. You have been asked to develop an essay explaining IF current account deficits are bad. In your answer, be sure you FULLY explain:   what the current account captures,  what it means to have a current account deficit and what is likely causing it,  the current account's role in the balance of payments,  how the accounts connect to trade, AND  the connection between the current account and the capital account...how and why are they related.   Make sure that you actually ANSWER the question that was asked.  Expected length is 1-1.25 pages, single spaced, with good content. Be thorough and detailed, illustrating an understanding of these concepts.  You will be judged on the depth, accuracy, and persuasiveness of your explanation.  *This is a bit open-ended and you need to put some structure in place. **Expected length is about 1-1.25 pages (equivalent), single-spaced, where large headers, etc. do not contribute to length. I don't think you can do a good job with an essay that is much shorter.  ***Note that a few sentences is not sufficient to answer this question and will not earn you an acceptable score. ****Be detailed and be thorough. *****Content is the most important contributor to your grade. But writing quality counts too. I do not expect perfection from a timed essay. But I do expect that your work is proofread and major grammar errors and spelling errors are addressed.

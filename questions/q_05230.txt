Select the best answer by choosing the correct letter. Use the excerpt below from a first grade science lesson to answer the next 3 questions. During a science lesson on the functions of the skin, Ms. Blot talks to her students about the skin of an apple. Ms. Blot:  Why does an apple have a skin? Tom:  To cover it up. Pedro:  To make it red. James: No, sometimes apples are green. Ms.Blot:  Yes, that's very good.  An apple's skin can be different colors.  The skin covers the apple up and gives it color.  Another thing the skin does is protects it from germs and insects.  Today we will do an experiment to see how an apple's skin protects it.  What do you think will happen to this apple if we cut off some of its skin? Melissa:   It will turn brown. Esther:  It will get mushy. Ms. Blot:  Melissa predicts the apple will turn brown and Esther predicts it will get mushy.  A prediction is what somebody thinks will happen.  What do the rest of you think will happen?   Now I will cut some of the skin off this apple and we'll put it on the shelf.  We'll also set out an apple that has not been cut.  How will we know if our predictions were right or not? Which of the following strategies for promoting learning is most evident in Ms. Blot's lesson?  (Course Objective 4).

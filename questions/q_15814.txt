Prove the following statement using a proof by cases.   [Hint: there are 3 cases] "For all non-negative integers n <= 2, n2 <= 2n+1."  Use good proof technique.   Grading rubric:1 pt. State any givens and assumptions.3 pt. Clearly identify the cases and prove each case.1 pt. State the final conclusion at the end of the proof. Note:  To avoid the need for typing superscript exponents, you may use the expression 'n-squared' or 'n^2' to represent n2.  Also the <= symbol can be written as
Instructions The R Markdown file / Jupyter Notebook file includes the questions, the empty code chunk sections for your code, and the text blocks for your responses. Answer the questions below by completing the R Markdown file / Jupyter Notebook file. You must answer the questions using one of these files. You will submit a html file using one of the two files. You may make slight adjustments to get the file to knit/convert but otherwise keep the formatting the same. Once you've finished answering the questions, submit your responses in a single knitted/converted file (just like the homework peer assessments). There are 8 questions total, each worth between 4-11 points. Partial credit may be given if your code is correct but your conclusion is incorrect or vice versa. Next Steps:  Save the .Rmd/.ipynb file in your R working directory - the same directory where you will download the "Mortality.csv" data file into. Having both files in the same directory will help in reading the "Mortality.csv" file. Read the question and create the R code necessary within the code chunk section immediately below each question. Knitting this file will generate the output and insert it into the section below the code chunk. Type your answer to the questions in the text block provided immediately after the response prompt. Once you've finished answering all questions, knit this file and submit the knitted file as HTML on Canvas.  Mock Example Question 5 - 4pts This will be the exam question - each question is already copied from Canvas and inserted into individual text blocks below, you do not need to copy/paste the questions from the online Canvas exam. # Example code chunk area. Enter your code below the comment Mock Response to Question 5: This is the section where you type your written answers to the question. Depending on the question asked, your typed response may be a number, a list of variables, a few sentences, or a combination of these elements.   Ready? Let's begin.

(Chapter 20) The Controller of Nip-it-in-the-Bud Inc. has studied the possibility of implementing a JIT production system. The company is currently producing (and selling) 20,000 units, with a contribution margin of $10 per unit. The annual incremental retooling costs of the JIT system is projected to be about $67,000 however, the new system will lower annual insurance costs by $10,000 and storage costs will drop by $20,000 a year as the company will be able to reuse warehouse space for other strategic purposes.  In addition, material handling costs will drop by $10,000 a year and because of a resulting increase in quality and faster delivery, the company's contribution margin per unit will increase by $2.00 and sales of units will increase by 5%.  Required:  Calculate the net annual incremental benefit of the JIT system implementation. Use a negative sign if income would be reduced.

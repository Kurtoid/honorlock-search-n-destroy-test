Question 4 a A cosmetology school runs a hair salon that is staffed by students and is very popular because of their low prices.  Students working at the salon are classified as underclassmen or upperclassmen, and 65% of the student employees are upperclassmen.  Each customer is randomly assigned a stylist when they arrive for an appointment. At the end of each appointment, the customer completes a short survey and provides a rating out of 5 stars (where 1 is low and 5 is high) for the service they received.  The pmfs of the ratings received by upperclassmen and underclassmen over the past year are given below.   Underclassmen                                                               Upperclassmen     Probability   Score       Probability   Score     0.15   1 star       0.05   1 star     0.10   2 stars       0.10   2 stars     0.25   3 stars       0.20   3 stars     0.40   4 stars       0.40   4 stars     0.10   5 stars       0.25   5 stars       a) Jordan goes to the salon twice over the course of the spring semester.  What is the probability that Jordan is served once by an underclassman and once by an upperclassman?

The 1000 spiny damsel fish in the previous question were sampled in 2014. The table below includes the number of each phenotype for 2014 and 2019. Use the Hardy-Weinberg equations to answer the questions below. Remember the Hardy-Weinberg equations are: p + q =1 where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 where p2 is the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype, 2pq is the frequency of heterozygous genotype, and q2 is the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype.      phenotype 2014 2019   thermotolerant 350 442   normal 650 558    For 2014: p = [p2014] q = [q2014] p2 = [psq2014] 2pq = [2pq2014] q2 = [qsq2014]   For 2019: p = [p2019] q = [q2019] p2 = [psq2019] 2pq = [2pq2019] q2 = [qsq2019]   Is the population evolving? [yn] Explain. [explain]   If the population is evolving, which criteria for Hardy-Weinberg has likely been violated. [violation] Predict what the allele frequencies would be 5 years from now if no further environmental change took place. You do not need numbers; a general explanation is fine. [5years]

Module 09 - Self-talk & Mental Imagery: Question: Nate notices that following 6 weeks of his mental imagery training, he is kicking the ball farther, kicking the ball more accurately, and able to pass the ball farther than 6 weeks prior. If imagery is contributing to these improvements, Nate's experiences are consistent with findings that show mental imagery catalyzes ______. Nate's Back Story: Nate played college football before transitioning to Rugby when he realized he would not make it in the NFL. He has transitioned to the sport well and now finds himself competing for a spot on the U.S. Rugby 7s Olympic Team. Because he is still transitioning to the sport of Rugby, he sometimes feels lost during competition and reverts to football specific skills he'd practiced since he was in Pop Warner. He decides to meet with a Sport Psychology Consultant who prescribes some PETTLEP based mental imagery training. In Nate's mental imagery script, he is instructed to wear his uniform while imagining passing, executing a line out, a garryowen (up and under) kick-pass, and kicking a penalty goal.

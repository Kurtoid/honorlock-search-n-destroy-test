Honorlock Requirements The way Honorlock works is that it flags suspicious behavior for later review by the faculty. We are instilling the following guidelines to help make students aware of the standards we expect them to maintain:  You MUST have functional hardware for this exam (laptop, PC, webcam, etc.), NOTE: you will need an internet connection along with Google Chrome and the Honorlock Chrome extension installed on your computer. If you do not have any of these items, please notify your instructor two weeks prior to the 1st exam. You can request items that you will need for online courses and proctored exams per the link below: https://ucir.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5j86N1rD2uOla4d (Links to an external site.)  (Links to an external site.)If you are a student who requires accommodations for your exam(s), we recommend you submit your updated accommodation letter to your instructor no later than 3 business days prior to the first exam, NOTE: this request is being made because instructors will have to list and mark each student(s) accommodations within the exam created through Canvas as well as identify said students for the proctor. These markings are necessary because they assure that the student will receive their agreed upon accommodations. You MUST present your UCID, Driver's License, or Student ID per the instructions of the proctor (other ID can be used but it is the duty of the student to make this arrangement at least 72 hours in advance of the exam with the instructor). You MUST perform a full 360 room scan. NOTE: you should not have posted notes or any notes of any kind that were used for studying, the textbook, etc., within the room that you will be taking your exam. You MUST use a webcam associated with your computer or laptop. NOTE: webcams on your cell phone, hand camera, or camcorder are not permissible. You MUST present all scratch sheets of paper to your webcam frontwise, sidewise, and backwise. NOTE: the maximum number of scratch sheets will be specified before each exam, and all scratch sheets of paper must be ripped up in front of your webcam. You MUST submit a live session of your exam (no STILL images allowed). NOTE: exams in question where a still image is uploaded may result in the student failing the exam. A second scenario of this kind will result in the student being notified and steps being taken towards academic misconduct procedures. You MUST submit a live audio session of your exam, i.e., your microphone must be on and unmuted the entire time you are taking the test. Earbuds and headphones are not allowed. NOTE: exams in question were no sound is heard may result in the student failing the exam. A second scenario of this kind will result in the student being notified and steps being taken towards academic misconduct procedures. You WILL NOT be allowed to use an online graphing tool during your tests, including but not limited to Desmos, Wolfram Alpha, etc. A physical calculator is required (please see the Text and Technology section of the syllabus). You MUST present your calculator to your webcam frontwise, sidewise, and backwise. You WILL NOT be allowed to use your book or notes during the test. All tests are closed book and closed notes unless otherwise stated by the instructor. If you have questions about what is allowed, ask your instructor. You cannot use Artificial Intelligence associated with an electronic device, i.e., SIRI or any type. Cell phone applications, including but not limited to Wolfram Alpha or Photomath, are strictly forbidden. NOTE: you should not have any electronics in the room you are taking the exam other than the one computer with a single monitor you are using to take the exam and your calculator (see 9. above), i.e. no cell phones, smart watches, tablets, etc., Honorlock detects cell phone usage, internet browsing, etc. You should not have other people in the room with you. NOTE: to decrease the likelihood of your being flagged, you should look to take your exam in a room that is away from friends or family which can create extensive background noise, unless, there is a home situation that makes this unavoidable. Please take down any pictures, posters, flags, or anything with with face-like images. Your exam will be flagged if your camera believes the face in the picture/poster/flag is a real person. You understand that your exam session will be recorded and reviewed. NOTE: A video of your exam session is made available to the instructional team for review afterwards. The instructional team will be reviewing your exam sessions. These videos are only kept temporarily. NO talking or communication by any means with ANYONE is allowed. Talking out loud during the exam--including but not limited to reading a problem out loud and talking through how to solve a problem--is very suspicious and your exam will automatically be flagged for review. If you experience technical issues during the exam, you MUST contact your instructor immediately, within 24 hours of the exam. Technical issues DO NOT include failure to properly set up Honorlock BEFORE the exam.  If your technical issues are verified, your instructor and the course coordinator will work with you to resolve the issue.  Evidence of real cheating collected by Honorlock will be used to report academic misconduct to the college. Violation of any of the above requirements is considered a breach in Academic Integrity, and may be penalized by a point deduction on your exam. Ultimately, please keep in mind that certain innocent behaviors can get your exam flagged. This doesn't mean you are in trouble, but it does mean that at least one instructor will look at the webcam/audio footage from your test.

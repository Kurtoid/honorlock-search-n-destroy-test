Balance the following redox reaction in basic solution:                          CrO42-(aq)  + SO32-(aq) - Cr(OH)3(s) + SO42-(aq) Enter a coefficient of 1 if needed and if the substance is not in the overall reaction, enter a 0 for the coefficient.

Slanted surfaces with friction: In the figure, a T-bar ski tow pulls a skier up a hill inclined at 10deg above horizontal. The skier starts from rest and is pulled by a cable that exerts a tension T at an angle of 30deg above the surface of the hill. The mass of the skier is 60 kg and the effective coefficient of kinetic friction between the skis and the snow is 0.100. What is the maximum tension in the cable if the starting acceleration is not to exceed 0.400 g?

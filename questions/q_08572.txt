Using a loop, write a method (so don't forget to include the method header) that shifts all of elements in an int array to the left by one index, and then moves the first element into the last position. For example, if you call the method with the array (hint: use a local variable to temporarily hold an array value).

Answer all parts.  In a previous poll, 46% of adults with children under the age of 18 reported that their family ate dinner together seven nights a week.  Suppose that, in a more recent poll, 534 of 1200 adults with children under the age of 18 reported that their family ate dinner together seven nights a week.  Is there sufficient evidence that the proportion of families with children under the age of 18 who ate dinner together seven nights a week has decreased?  Use the

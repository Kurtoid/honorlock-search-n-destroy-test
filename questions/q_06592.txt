Curly, Larry and Moe were really angry with Groucho because Groucho had reported them to the police for serving alcohol at a party where most of the guests were only 18 years old. One Friday night, the three of them went to the Good Times cafe to get some take-out.  As they walked up to the door of the cafe, they saw Groucho coming out.  Larry said, "Come on guys, let's get Groucho." Larry ran up to Groucho and started punching and shoving him.  Curly didn't touch Groucho, but he kept urging Larry to keep pushing  Groucho.  He said things like, "Push him harder, Larry! Push him down and kick him!"  Moe really didn't want to get involved and he stayed back.  He didn't help Groucho in any way, but he didn't walk away from the scene or call the police, either. While this was going on, Donald, a customer in the cafe, came out and saw what was happening.  He didn't know Groucho, but he could see that he was being attacked by a much larger man and so Donald decided to try to help Groucho.  He ran over and tried to pull Larry away so that Groucho could run away.  At that point, Curly grabbed Donald, shoved him up against a wall and forcibly held him there so that he couldn't help Groucho. When people driving by saw what was happening, they called 911.  When Curly, Larry and Moe heard the police siren, they started running across the parking lot.  They jumped a fence and continued running through people's backyards.  Moe suddenly realized that his cousin, Bingo, lived just a few houses away.  Moe ran to Bingo's place and started hammering on the back door.  When Bingo answered, Moe said, "Bing, you have to let us in and hide us.  The cops are after us for pounding a guy."  Bingo let all three of them in. For each of the people in the scenario, determine whether they can be charged with anything.  Explain your answers.  Give the sections of the Criminal Code that apply.

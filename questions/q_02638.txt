You are cell biologist interested in the regulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, whose pathway components are frequently mutated in cancer cells. EGF stimulates the EGF Receptor (EGFR), which is an RTK. You compare how skin cells cultured from a healthy skin sample versus those derived from a skin tumor respond to long-term stimulation with the EGF ligand. You lyse the cells at the indicated time points, with and without EGF stimulation (- or +), and western blot with antibodies reacting with phosphorylated EGFR, pan-EGFR or Actin. From the below figure, in the box provided  please succinctly answer (1-5 sentences max each) : A. What is the likely mechanism of regulation of normal EGFR in response to long-term EGF stimulation? B. Propose a hypothesis as to the molecular basis of why the EGFR behaves differently in the tumor and why this behavior may contribute to the tumorigenesis.

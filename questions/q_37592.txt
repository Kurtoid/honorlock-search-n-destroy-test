A clinical study is designed to assess differences in albumin levels in adults following diets with different amounts of protein. Low protein diets are often prescribed for patients with kidney failure. Albumin is the most abundant protein in blood, and its concentration in the serum is measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL). Clinically, serum albumin concentrations are also used to assess whether patients get sufficient protein in their diets. Three diets are compared, ranging from 5% to 15% protein, and the 15% protein diet represents a typical American diet. The albumin levels of participants following each diet are shown below.      5% Protein 10 % Protein 15 % Protein   3.1 4.0 3.8   2.6 4.8 5.5   2.9 2.9 5.0    3.4 4.3    4.2       Is there is a difference in serum albumin levels among subjects on the three different diets? We will use a nonparametric test to answer this question.   For reference, here is the data is sorted order:     protien group  5 5 10 5 10 15 10 10 15 10 15 15   value 2.6 2.9 2.9 3.1 3.4 3.8 4.0 4.2 4.3 4.8 5.0 5.5   rank

For questions 9-12 apply your knowledge of feedback loops to this example: It is very important to regulate blood solute concentration (osmolarity) by conserving or eliminating water.  When blood solute concentration (osmolarity) increases, chemoreceptors of the hypothalamus detect this change.  The hypothalamus triggers the release of anti-diuretic hormone.  Anti-diuretic hormone travels through the blood and binds to receptors on kidney cells.  The kidney cells conserve more water (preventing water loss in the urine).  As a result, blood solute concentration (osmolarity) decreases.

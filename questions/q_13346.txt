Snake venom from some poisonous snakes often contain the enzyme phospholipase A2. Phospholipase A2 is a hydrolase that cleaves ester bonds (see figure below for site of cleavage site of a glycerophospholipid). Cleavage by phospholipase A2 generates the molecule arachidonate as one of the products, which causes tissue and cell damage and inflammation at the site of the snake bite. This damage and inflammation results because arachidonate can act as a detergent (i.e., disrupts cell membranes) and is also the precursor for one of the prostaglandins that initiates inflammation.   Which of the following will result if arachidonate is added to an aqueous solution above its critical concentration?

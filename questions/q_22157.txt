Lecture Test 3, Extra Credit Question #1  Suppose you are an ecologist study competition in 4 species of grasshopper mice that inhabit your study plot.  After exhaustive study, you have documented the following:                  All species eat exactly the same food: field crickets that are 12 mm long.                  All 4 species are uniformly dispersed in the plot.                  All species feed in the exact same locations.                  All species are resident and hibernate at the exact same time.                  None of the species collects and hordes food.  They all eat food immediately at the source. Your research indicates that competition for food is negligible and you suspect resource partitioning.  How could these species be partitioning when they overlap so extensively?

Integrative B 3 IMPORTANT: Choose EITHER Problem B2 (previous question) OR B3 (this question). DO NOT DO BOTH PROBLEMS! If you choose this problem, points will be recorded in the B2 box for the earlier question.  This problem (B3) is also worth 30 points total, but the points box for this question notes 0 just due to structuring in Canvas. A statistics professor conducts an experiment to compare the effectiveness of two methods of teaching his course.  Method I is the usual way he teaches his course: lectures, homework assignments, and a final exam.  Method II is the same as Method I, except that students receiving Method II get one additional hour per week in which they solve illustrative problems under the guidance of the professor.  Since the professor is also interested in how the methods affect students of differing mathematical abilities, volunteers for the experiment are subdivided according to mathematical ability into superior, average and poor groups.  Five students from each group are randomly assigned to Method I and five students from each group to Method II.  At the end of the course, all 30 students take the same final exam.  The following exam scores (out of a possible 50 points) are recorded:                          Math Ability (Factor B)       Teaching Method (Factor A)     Method I (A1)   Method II (A2)     Superior (B1)   39 48 44 41 42   A1B1 = 214 SS = 46.8   49 47 43 47 48   A2B1 = 234 SS = 20.8     Average (B2)   43 40 42 36 35   A1B2 = 196 SS = 50.8   38 45 42 46 44   A2B2 = 215 SS = 40     Poor (B3)   30 29 37 33 36   A1B3 = 165 SS = 50   37 34 40 41 33   A2B3 = 185 SS = 50     A1 = 575                        B1 = 448 A2 = 634                        B2 = 411 G = 1209                       B3 = 350 Sum of x2 = 49,587   a.

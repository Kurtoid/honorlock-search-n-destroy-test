Using the 5-step process for the Critical Value Method, or the 6-step process for the P-Value Method, perform a hypothesis test for the following scenario:   According to a study done by Michigan State University, 15.44% of deaths individuals under the age of 19 are due to injuries from firearms.  These deaths are due to many different circumstances:  suicide, accidental discharge, school shootings, collateral damage, etc.  In the city of Houston, TX, there were 37 teenager deaths for the month of January.  Of these, 9 were related to injuries due to firearms.  Many suburban and rural families avoid moving to Houston because they believe they believe there is a higher proportion of teens and children killed by gun violence.  Do the data support this claim, or should we assume the proportion of individuals under the age of 19 killed by injuries related to firearms is no different than the national average reported by Michigan State University?

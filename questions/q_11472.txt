Reminder: You are required to use a mirror, phone, or iPad to show us your computer monitor before beginning this exam. If you did not do this during your room scan, this is your last opportunity to do so. If you do not show us your monitor, 10 points will be deducted from your practical grade.   Full disclosure: We can see the order in which you answer questions. Do not continue to the rest of the practical until you have completed the monitor check, put away your device, and marked "complete" below.

According to Harley-Davidson (H-D) management, the company does not sell motorcycles or riding gear. Instead, according to H-D's mission statement, the company is in the business of "fulfilling dreams." Over the years, H-D has developed a business culture that it describes as "Harleyness."

The H-D employee immediately made arrangements for the part to be shipped to the rally at no charge to the customer. The fact that H-D employees have the authority to solve customers' problems quickly illustrates that these employees are given

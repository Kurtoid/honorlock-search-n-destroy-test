The underlying processes and molecules of gene expression are typically referred to as the 'Central Dogma of Biology' as they are relatively consistent amongst all living organisms. In eukaryotic organisms specifically, our genes are contained within our _A_ (macromolecule) that is found within the _B_ of a cell. In order to express the gene, we first have to make  _C_ (macromolecule) via the process of _D_.  Following this process, we will modify the molecule produced to prepare it for the next phase. Following modification, the mature _C_ will be moved to the _E_ of the cell where the process of _F_ occurs to produce _G_, which perform the function encoded for by the gene.

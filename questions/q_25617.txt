Parasitism C. Suppose the researchers conducted an experiment to investigate whether other species of defensive symbionts can protect fruit flies from the nematode parasite (Howardula). In the first experiment, they screened for beneficial symbiotic bacteria by searching for species similar to Spiroplasma bacteria.  They established a large population of fruit flies and exposed them to a nematode parasite. Then they separated the fruit fly individuals into two treatment groups: those without parasite (Howardula) and those with parasite (Howardula). They screened (looked) one of seven species of symbionts (A-G). The results are shown in Table 1 below.  Table 1. Percentage of Fruit Fly Individuals with Different Species of Symbionts         Bacterial Species       Treatment   A   B   C   D   E   F   G     Howardula absent   50   40   80   30   50   95   30     Howardula present   50   90   10   30   75   95   96     C.

(DCI) manufacturers a line of drones that are distributed to large retailers. The line consists of four models of drones. The following data is available regarding the models:    Model DCI Selling Priceper Unit Variable Cost per Unit Demand/Year (units)   Model D1 $835 $115 1,535   Model D2 $315 $110 2,865   Model D3 $415 $105 3,535   Model D4 $515 $135 3,300      Drone Concepts is considering the addition of a fifth model to its line of drones. This model would be sold to retailers for $625. The variable cost of this unit is $315. The demand for the new Model D5 is estimated to be 2,000 units per year. Forty percent of these unit sales of the new model is expected to come from other models already being manufactured by Drone Concepts (10 percent from Model D1, 30 percent from Model D2, 40 percent from Model D3, and 20 percent from Model D4). Drone Concepts will incur a fixed cost of $550,000 to add the new model to the line. Based on the preceding data, should DCI add the new Model D5 to its line of drones? Why or why not? (Please be specific and remember to show all work CLEARLY  and highlight your answer in order to receive full credit otherwise points will be deducted)

Which statement(s) below about significant figures in calculations is/are FALSE? I           Addition and subtraction--round the answer according to the number of decimal places in the number with the most decimal places. II          Multiplication and division--the answer is limited to the number of digits in the number with the fewest significant digits. III        Logarithms and antilogarithms--the number of significant figures in the antilogarithm should equal the number of digits in the mantissa.

Kevin suggests that Ted cluck like a chicken during the hypnosis not because he is experiencing an altered state of consciousness but because he is playing the role of a hypnotized person. This is a good example of the ________ theory of hypnotism.
In the demand model, the endogenous or non-patient-specific variable is:
The following image shows an incident light beam in material 1 striking an interface with material 2. At this interface the light splits, with some (labeled "A") staying in material 1 and some ("B") entering material 2 at a different angle. The angles in the image may not be to scale. Material 1 has an index of refraction of 1.6 and Material 2 has an index of refraction of 1.3. The incident angle is 50deg.     Make your own sketch of the same image, including a label clearly showing the incident angle thi , the reflected angle threflect , and the refracted angle threfract . [3] Find the value of threflect . [2] Find the value of threfract . [4] Is there any angle at which light traveling from Material 1 into Material 2 can be totally internally reflected? You don't have to find the angle itself--just say whether or not it exists. Explain your answer. [2]
The Marshall Plan ________.
First, design on scratch paper the logic circuit corresponding to the following logic expression: X = NOT(NOT(B) OR C OR D) AND (D AND NOT(C) AND A) Do not simplify the expression and only use the following gates (with at most 2 inputs):  Now that you have implemented the logic circuit for the expression, examine the parts below showing the four inputs A - D to the expression, logic gates (some already connected) with their inputs I0 - I9 and outputs O0 - O4, and the output X of the expression:  Your task for this question is to wire up all of the parts above to implement the logic circuit for the expression guided by your design. Select from the dropdown boxes the appropriate wire connections, but be careful since order matters. For example, if the input for I0 , I1 , I2 is chosen to be A, O1, C then this ordering means that I0 is connected to A, I1 is connected to O1, and I2 is connected to C. What is the input for I0 , I1 , I2? [r1]What is the input for I3 , I4? [r2]What is the input for I5 , I6? [r3]What is the input for I7 , I8? [r4]What is the input for I9? [r5]What is connected to X? [r6]

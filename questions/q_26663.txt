Write a class. Your class should have an  __init__() method with three parameters: self, set1, and set2. Assume that set1 and set2 are sets. This method should store the sets in attributes of self. Your class should have a method called process() with two parameters: self and set3. Assume set3 is a set. This method should return a set containing all items from set3 that are in set1 or set2 but not both. For example, if set1 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and set2 is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and set3 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, your method should return {4, 7}.

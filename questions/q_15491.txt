I understand that Valencia's Student Code of Conduct applies during this quiz to encourage learning.  I understand that all forms of Academic Dishonesty are prohibited while taking this test.  The only resources permitted are those listed by the instructor in the Instructions.  I agree not to discuss the test with anyone until after the testing time period has passed. I agree to follow the rules for proctoring.  I understand that failure to follow them may result in a 0 for the test grade.   For proctoring: Prepare your testing area by following these recommendations:  If you are not looking at the screen, adjust the camera to show what you are working on Sit at a clean desk or table (not on a bed or couch) Lighting in the room must be bright enough to be considered "daylight" quality. Overhead lighting is preferred; however, if overhead is not possible, the source of light should not be behind you. Clear your working space (table or desk) of all other materials. When prompted, show photo identification in the form of a Valencia-issued student ID card or government-issued ID card (i.e. driver's license, passport)  When prompted, do a room scan, be sure to include your work area. Make sure to do a complete 360-degree rotation of your room, then show your workspace.  Show your scratch paper front and back.  If you use a laptop, make sure it is fully charged and keep the charger within arm's reach. Make sure to have Chrome and the Honorlock extension installed: Google Chrome and Honorlock Chrome Extension.    The following items/actions are not permitted:  No writing visible on the desk or on walls. No websites other than Canvas and the Honorlock proctoring extension should be used or open while taking a proctored exam. Close all other programs and/or windows on the testing computer prior to logging into the proctored test environment.  Be careful not to click out of the Honorlock until you submit the test or your test will be flagged. Make sure music/televisions are not playing in the background. Communication or receiving assistance from others is not permitted during a proctored assessment. Exceptions: contacting Honorlock support or your institution's help desk. No other persons except the test-taker should be in the room during testing.  Using a phone, calculator, or any other electronic device, other than your test-taking device, is not permitted.  Remain visible in the web camera during the entire duration of the exam. Leaving the room during the testing period is not permitted. You may not take the computer into another room to finish testing (exam must be completed in the same room the "Exam Environment View" is completed). Headphones and smartwatches are not permitted. Dual monitors are not permitted.    By entering my name here, I agree to follow the Student Code of Conduct and take any consequences thereof.

Landlord owns several properties in the city. One of them (called "the Property" in the lease) is leased to a Kentucky Fried Chicken location. The lease with KFC provides:  Landlord shall not during the Lease Term operate or permit to be operated on any real estate that Landlord owns, manages or otherwise controls within one mile of the Property any fast food restaurant, or restaurant facility whose principal food product is chicken on the bone, boneless chicken or chicken sandwiches.  Landlord signs a lease with a Burger King franchisee to open a Burger King on another piece of property owned by Landlord, which is only a half-mile from the KFC. KFC objects on the grounds that BK is a "fast food restaurant" and thus is barred. Landlord retorts that BK's "principal food product" is not "chicken on the bone, boneless chicken or chicken sandwiches," and so it is not barred. If the matter goes to litigation, which is the most correct outcome using ordinary interpretation guidelines?
Once customers make a decision to terminate the relationship, they do not communicate their intent to the company.
4. Consider a two-echelon supply chain consisting of three possible plants, two distribution centers, and three warehouses. Two of the three plants (P1, P2, P3) will ship units to the distribution centers (DC1, DC2), which will subsequently supply the warehouses (W1, W2, W3). The plant shipment capacities are 1800, 1500, and 1600 units for P1, P2, and P3, respectively. Distribution centers DC1 and DC2 have shipment capacity limits of 1650 and 1550, respectively. Demand at warehouses W1, W2, and W3 are 1000, 900, and 1100 units, respectively. Currently, there are 40 units stored at DC1 and 55 units stored at DC2. Management would like a distribution plan that leaves 30 units at both DCs after demand at each warehouse is satisfied. The variable costs of shipping are shown below. Formulate a single integer linear programming model that, when solved, will determine which two of the three plants to open and will provide a distribution plan that meets all constraints and minimizes total variable distribution costs. [Do not solve the problem. Just provide the formulation without any attempt to reduce complexity by solving (or partially solving) the problem.]     DC1 DC2   W1 W2 W3   P1 7 5  DC1 4 5 7   P2 6 7  DC2 5 6 5   P3 4 7

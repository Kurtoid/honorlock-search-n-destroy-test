The diagram below shows an object, an image, and the location of an optical component, which is either a mirror or a lens. You will need to determine what that optical component needs to be and its magnification in the given scenario.           I recommend the following procedure, answering each part of the question in order:   Look at the position of the object and the image and the nature of the image (real or virtual). That should be enough to tell you whether the optical component is a mirror or a lens. Which one is it? [1] Now, taking into consideration the sign conventions for a lens or a mirror, whichever you are working with, use the distances to find the focal length of the optical component. What is the focal length? [4] Now consider the focal length. Is the optical component converging or diverging? [1] What is the magnification in this scenario? [3]

Questions 11 to 20 refer to the following case: Miss J is 17 years old. She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) 5 years ago and has been prescribed insulin as a basal-bolus regimen to help achieve glycaemic control (Lantus(r) 18 units once daily at evening time; Novorapid(r) 1-5 units at meal times according to carbohydrate intake). She has struggled with the perceived stigma of diabetes and objects to having to inject herself on multiple occasions each day. This has made achieving a good level adherence difficult.   For several weeks she has been very sporadic with her insulin self-administration and over the past several days has not used any insulin at all.   Question: Young patients with a recent diagnosis of T1DM should also be screened for which condition?

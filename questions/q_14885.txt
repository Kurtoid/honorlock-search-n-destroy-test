Which food item best represents a complete protein?
Which best describes the first law of thermodynamics?
A partial displacement of a bone end from its position in the joint is called a:
Removal of the __________ would be more harmful toa one-year-old child than an adult.
Ceteris paribus, if the Fed raises the discount rate, then:
If you define a variable at a super class level, all the subclasses automatically inherit the variable's setters and getters.
21.  Infection of the pulp tissue is called:
Worms use ________ to respond to environmental factors and infection, and these changes can last for generations.
Consider two receptors, one inhibitory and one activating, on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells: KIR receptors that interact with certain class I MHC proteins, and special Fc receptors that recognize the tail region of IgG antibodies. When NK cells are incubated with an immortalized (i.e. cancerous) B cell line derived by infection of human B cells with Epstein-Barr Virus, the B cells are killed by NK cells. Normal B cells, by contrast, are not efficiently killed by NK cells. In each of the following scenarios, indicate whether the described changes are expected to enhance, suppress or have no effect on the cytotoxicity (killing activity) of the NK cells in this system. Match the prompt with one of these choices. Some may be used more than once or not at all.

Below shows the phase diagram for compound R.      What phase of matter is compound Q in at -700
1. (35 points) A Rankine steam plant operates with reheat and an open feedwater heater (OFWH). Steam exits the boiler at 560degC and 8.0 MPa. The steam exits the high pressure turbine at 1.0 MPa.  Some of the steam goes to the OFWH and the rest is reheated to 540degC.  The steam exits the low pressure turbine at the condenser pressure of 70 kPa.  The pumps are ideal, the turbines have an efficiency of 90%. The table provides some of the properties that you will need. You DON'T need to fill in EVERY blank in the table.                 b. Determine the thermal efficiency of the cycle, in percent.

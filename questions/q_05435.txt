Application question: You have set up an experiment which allows you to measure the amount of lacZ activity in various mutants.  When beta-galactosidase is produced in the presence of this substance called XGAL, a blue product is produced.  This provides a readout for when beta-galactosidase (lacZ) is being produced.  If no beta-galactosidase is produced the colony would be white and if there is basal activity, the colony will appear light blue.  For each of the conditions below, please determine whether you would see a blue colony, white colony, or light blue colony.

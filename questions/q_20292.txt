Four randomly selected 100-ohm resistors are connected in a series circuit. Suppose that it is known that the population of all such resistors has a normal distribution with a mean of 100 ohms and a standard deviation of 1.8 ohms. a. What are the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the average ohms in four randomly selected 100-ohm resistors? mean of sampling distribution = [mean] standard deviation of sampling distribution = [s] b. What is the probability that the average resistance of the four 100-ohm resistors in the circuit is less than 98.2 ohms? (Use the empirical rule) [probability]

Your wastewater treatment plant produces 18000 gallons of biosolids per day at 2% solids content with a specific gravity of 1.02.  It has the following concentration of heavy metals (mg/kg-dry).    Pollutant (mg/kg)   Arsenic 50   Cadmium 20   Chromium 1500   Copper 2000   Lead 700   Mercury 10   Molybdenum 50   Nickel 300   Selenium 50   Zinc 2900    You are are answering multiple questions based on these parameters. (e) You will further dry these biosolids and sell then in 2 ft3 bags.  The bagged biosolids will have a solids content of 35% and a specific gravity of 1.35.  Your should label the bag as saying "apply no more that X bags of these biosolids on 100 ft2 of land annually."  What is X?

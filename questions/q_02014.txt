Problem 3. Consider radiative exchange within the enclosure depicted in Figure 3 with appropriate dimensions provided. Surface 1 is gray and diffuse with an emittance of e1 = 0.5 and a temperature of T1 = 350 K; surface 2 is well-insulated and behaves as a blackbody at a temperature of T2 = 550 K; surface 3 is perfectly specular with a reflectance of r3 = 0.2  and a temperature of T3 = 600 K. All surfaces are opaque.     Figure 3.   Assume the following:  Non-participating media Local thermal equilibrium Isothermal, homogeneous surfaces  Determine the net radiation fluxes for surfaces 1 and 3 (q1 and q3, respectively) with all relevant view factors. (Hint: start with surface 1).

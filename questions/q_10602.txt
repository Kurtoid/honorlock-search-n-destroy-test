MAPP is the name of another gas used for gas welding.
(40 minutes) An oil cooler consists of a straight tube of 20 mm O.D. and a wall thickness of 2 mm enclosed within a pipe and concentric with it. The external pipe is well insulated. Oil flows through the tube at 0.05 kg/s, while cooling liquid flows in the annulus in the opposite direction at a rate of 0.1 kg/s (cp = 4000 J/kg-K). The oil enters at 180degC and leaves at 80degC, while the cooling fluid enters at 30degC. It is known that the heat transfer coefficient of the water in the annulus is 4000 W/m2-K. Find the length of the cooler. Neglect:  the resistance due to the tube wall and fouling the effect of entrance length and variable property effects  The hot fluid properties are as follows:cp = 3561 J/kg-K, k = 0.380 W/m-K, u= 2.172 x 10-4 kg/m-s, r= 1006 kg/m3.

Many subjects showed signs of nervousness in the experimental situation, and especially upon administering the more powerful shocks. In a large number of cases the degree of tension reached extremes that are rarely seen in sociopsychological laboratory studies. Subjects were observed to sweat, tremble, stutter, bite their lips, groan, and dig their fingernails into their flesh. These were characteristic rather than exceptional responses to the experiment.--Stanley Milgram, "Behavioral Study of Obedience," 1963, p. 376. PARAPHRASEIn his experiments on obedience to authority figures, Milgram (1963) noted that subjects exhibited "signs of extreme tension." Reactions such as perspiring and groaning were, at the time, unprecedented in sociopsychological studies, and they disturbed researchers overseeing the experiments (p. 376).

(Swiderski) Select the most appropriate match for the diseases listed in the following three questions from answers a-e below. (1 point each)[a] Right dorsal colitis[b] Neorickettsia risticii[c] Lawsonia intracellularis[d] Rotavirus a - The most common cause of diarrhea in foals less than 6 months of age. This highly contagious agent has feco-oral transmission and prolonged viability in the environment. Histologic lesions are more severe in the villus tips leading to lactase deficiency and affected foals tend to have a transient high fever and malaise followed by diarrhea and improvement in clinical signs. b - This etiologic agent of diarrhea is most commonly associated with herd outbreaks in horses aged 4-7 months. The agent is spread by feco-oral transmission and causes proliferation of the epithelium, which leads to ileal and jejunal thickening and associated altered secretion, absorption, and profound hypoproteinemia. c - As a cause of diarrhea, this etiology causes a spectrum of mild to severe diarrhea, occurring sporadically along waterways in the US in the summer. This etiology is often identified by marked improvement within 24 hours of administering IV tetracyclined - This disease has a wide spectrum of clinical signs including diarrhea and is generally associated with chronic administration of NSAIDs. Weight loss, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia and recurrent colic are common. e - A very common etiologic agent of acute (and chronic) diarrhea in horses. This disease is difficult to definitively diagnose because the etiologic agent is not detectable until late in the disease course, despite inducing extensive multifocal eosinophilic mucosal damage, predominantly in the ventral colons and cecum.

A company has contracted to produce two products, A and B, over the months of June, July, and August. The total production capacity (expressed in hours) varies monthly. The following table provides the basic data of the situation:      June July August   Demand for A (units) 500 5000 750   Demand for B (units) 1000 1200 1200   Capacity (hours) 3000 3500 3000      The production rates in units per hour are 1.25 and 1 for products A and B, respectively. All demand must be met. However, demand for a later month may be filled from the production in an earlier one. For any carryover from one month to the next, holding cost of $.90 and $.75 per unit per month are charged for products A and B, respectively. The unit production costs for the two products are $30 and $28 for A and B, respectively.    Only develop a mathematical model to determine the best production schedule for the two products (do not find the optimal solution).

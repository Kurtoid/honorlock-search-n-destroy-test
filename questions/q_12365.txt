Dear Class, Congratulations, you made it! It has been a very tough semester, and I'm so glad we made it, together! Please do NOT email any of us to ask for extra credit or discuss your grade. Any email related to the grade will not be replied to.  I will include +/- points, to your favor. i.e. 89.5 will either be A or A-, depending on overall class performance and other factors.

There were no inventory balances of either product.  Condensed goat milk may be processed further to yield 45,000 gallons (the remainder is shrinkage) of a medicinal milk product, Xyla, for an additional processing cost of $4 per usable gallon. Xyla can be sold for $19 per gallon.   Skim goat milk can be processed further to yield 57,200 gallons of skim goat ice cream, for an additional processing cost per usable gallon of $4. The product can be sold for $9 per gallon. There are no beginning and ending inventory balances.   Using estimated net realizable value, what amount of the joint costs would be allocated Xyla and the skim goat ice cream?

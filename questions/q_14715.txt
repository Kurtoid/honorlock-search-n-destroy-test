Assume you are trying to replicate the findings of Mendel by conducting a series of studies on his beloved pea plants.  Flower color and flower position are characters found on different chromosomes in the pea plant genome (thus they sort independently of one another).        Character Dominant Trait  Recessive Trait   Flower Color Purple (P) White (p)   Flower Position Axial (A) Terminal (a)      If a plant that is heterozygous for both characters is allowed to self-fertilize (PpAa x PpAa), what proportion of the offspring would you expect to be as follows?  NOTE: The same answer can be used on multiple problems.   A.  Heterozygous for both characters? B.  Homozygous dominant for both characters? C.  Terminal and white? D.  Purple and axial?
Use properties of exponents to simplify the expression. First, express the answer in exponential form. Then, evaluate the expression.23 [?] 24

Principle #2 and Definition:
Explain, briefly in words,, using bullets, how to solve the problem above, as if you are tutoring a student how to solve the problem from start to end. Each item in your listing should be specific to the procedure for solving this problem (i.e., no need to include things like, "first, read the problem," or "identify the unknown quantity," ...) There is no need to type any formula. Remember, it shouldn't take you four minutes.

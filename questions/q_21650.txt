Given the following training data describing the conditions of someone enjoying outdoor sports.    Sky  Temp  Humid. Wind Forecast Enjoy Sport   Sunny Warm Normal Strong Same Yes   Cloudy Warm Normal Strong Same Yes   Rainy Warm Normal Strong Same No   Sunny Hot High Light Change No   Sunny Cold Low Medium Change Yes   Cloudy Cold Low Medium Same No   Rainy Warm Low Medium Same No    Compute the entropy for Enjoy Sport (ES) and the conditional entropy for Wind and the partitions the criteria generates. Then compute the Information Gain (IG) for the criteria Wind.  Round to the second digit after the decimal point before entering the computed value. For example, if the value computed is 0.9375, enter 0.94. H(ES) = [ES] Wind: H(ES|Strong) = [Strong] H(ES|Medium) = [Medium] H(ES|Light) = [Light] Information Gain (Temperature) = [IG]

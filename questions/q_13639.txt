A scientist isolates two specific mRNAs. One codes for the enzyme fowlase, an enzyme that is involved in digestion in chickadees; the other codes for the quail enzyme quailase that is involved in cellular carbohydrate metabolism. Both mRNAs are placed in a test tube with RER vesicles stripped of their ribosomes, free ribosomes and precursors for protein synthesis. When the protein synthesis reaction is complete, fowlase is found inside the vesicles; quailase is found in the liquid portion of the test tube outside the vesicles. What can one conclude about the two proteins?

A retailer plans to sell two different styles of a particular seasonal item. Because of the lead times involved, the retailer must order the items well before the selling season and cannot cancel, modify, or reorder during the selling season. Demand for each style during the season is Normally distributed with a mean of 2000 and a standard deviation of 800. The retailer pays $100 per unit and plans to sell them at the retail price of $175 per unit. Any units not sold during the season can be sold on the secondary market for $75 per unit.  The styles are delivered by ocean container at a cost of $4,000 per container and the retailer is responsible for this transportation cost.  a. Ignoring the transportation costs, how many units of each style 1 and how many units of style 2 should the retailer order to maximize expected profits?  Units of Style 1: [style1]  Units of Style 2: [style2] b. Ignoring the transportation costs, what will the retailer's expected profits from each style be? [ExpectedProfits] c. A container can accommodate any mix of the two styles up to a total of 5,000 units. Considering the cost of transportation, how many units of style 1  and how many units of style 2 should the retailer order to maximize expected profits after paying for transportation?  Units of Style 1: [style1withcap] Units of Style 2: [style2withcap] d. Now assume demand for Style 2 during the season is Normally distributed with a mean of 2,200 and a standard deviation of 1,000. Demand for Style 1 during the season is still Normally distributed with a mean of 2,000 and a standard deviation of 800.  A container can accommodate any mix of the two styles up to a total of 5,000 units. Considering the cost of transportation, how many units of style 1  and how many units of style 2 should the retailer order to maximize expected profits after paying for transportation?  Units of Style 1: [style1withcapplus] Units of Style 2: [style2withcapplus]

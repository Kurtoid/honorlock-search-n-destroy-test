A protein chain folds into its stable and unique 3-D structure, or conformation, by making many non-covalent bonds between amino acids from different parts of the chain.  These bonds are also critical for interactions with other proteins and cellular molecules.  For each of the following scenarios (questions 38-41), determine whether or not each type of amino acid side chain would be able to participate in that interaction.   This type of amino acid would participate in forming hydrogen bonds with water in order to aid a protein's solubility in aqueous solutions?  (Choose ALL that apply; you may end up choosing 0 - 4 of the possibilities)

Read the following scenario and answer the question below. Burning fossil fuels and their derivatives produces, among other things, harmful pollutants such as particulates, acid rain-producing sulfur and nitrogen oxides, and carbon oxides. These air pollutants threaten ecosystems all over the world, and high carbon dioxide levels contribute to global warming. Furthermore, fossils fuels have a limited supply. The market price of fossil fuels, especially crude oil, has continued to rise in recent years. Despite this, Americans continue to consume fossil fuels at alarming rates and rely upon them for most of energy needs. At various times, the federal government has considered mandating higher fuel efficiency standards for American vehicles as a possible solution to this environmental energy crisis. Most auto manufacturers, however, are opposed to the imposition of standards. Why would the consumption of fossils fuels remain high, despite high prices?

Virus infections induce production of interferons that act on infected cells to enhance their recognition by CD8 cytotoxic T cells. To counter these mechanisms, viruses often encode proteins that interfere with antigen processing and presentation. In an experiment, cells infected with Virus X are treated with Interferon alpha and compared with uninfected cells treated with interferon. Proteosomes are isolated from the two cell populations and their enzymatic activities are compared. The data in the below figure show the amino acid preferences for cleavage of peptides by the two samples of Proteosomes. Uninfected cells with no interferon display a pattern similar to the Virus + interferon condition (not shown).  Based on these data, Virus X most likely encodes a protein that interferes with what immunological mechanism? (1-3 sentences maximum).

Predict the output of the following program. Hint: Method int String::length() returns the length of a string. Also, method String String::substring(int beginIndex , int endIndex) generates and returns a substring of the original string. The substring begins at the specified beginIndex and extends to the character at index endIndex-1. .     public class MainClass{         static String coolRecursion(String input) {               int n = input.length();               if(n < 2)                       return input;               return coolRecursion(input.substring(2*n/3,n)) + coolRecursion(input.substring(n/3,2*n/3)) + coolRecursion(input.substring(0,n/3));          }         public static void main(String[] args){                System.out.println(coolRecursion("What does the method do?"));          }}

A Case study: Charles developed type 2 diabetes over 10 years ago. Recently, a scratch on his foot does not seem to be healing. His open sore, or ulcer, is the result of a diabetic foot. When he was finally seen by his physician, Charles was rushed to the operating room. His open sore, or ulcer, is the result of a diabetic foot. The concern here is that gas gangrene may have taken hold in the dead tissue. The most likely agent of gas gangrene is Clostridium perfringens, an endospore-forming, mesophilic, neutrophilic, gram-positive bacterium that secretes hemolytic enzymes. It is an obligate anaerobe that grows in tissue devoid of oxygen. Since dead tissue is no longer supplied with oxygen by the circulatory system, the dead tissue provides pockets of ideal environment for the growth of C. perfringens. Which growth conditions would you recommend for the detection of C. perfringens?

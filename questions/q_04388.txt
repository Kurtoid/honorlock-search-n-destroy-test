Under IE the Government gave books to all primary schools that did not have books for the children before the program (Schools that already had books for children did not get an additional books). The program started in 1990. Assume you have data on wages after 25 years of the implementation of the program, and you want to calculate the effect of the program on wages. Specifically, you have data for "young individuals" (those who were of schoolage when the program started), and "old individuals" (those who missed the chance of getting access to the program because they were older than 12 when the it was implemented). You have this information for two types of areas: high-intensity regions (school districts which got many books) and low-intensity regions (school districts which got few books). The data is presented in the table below. Use the data in the table to calculate "

Section 3: Repeat Sales Method (RSM) Consider an example with four home sales. In 2019, home A sold for $144,000, and home B sold for $237,500. In 2020, home C sold for $176,500, and home B sold for $245,000. Assume that those are the only sales that closed in 2019 and 2020. What is the house price appreciation from 2019 to 2020, in %, according to the repeat-sales methodology in this example?     Explain your solutions and answers. Correct answers without explanation and calculation steps qualify for a maximum of 50% of full credit.      22.57% 3.16% 12.86% It is impossible to calculate the value of the repeat-sales index in this example.

Normally, oxygen crosses the alveoli into the capillaries, tiny blood vessels that lie beside the air sacs; the oxygen is then carried to the rest of the body. But as the immune system wars with the invader, the battle itself disrupts this healthy oxygen transfer. Front-line white blood cells release inflammatory molecules called chemokines, which in turn summon more immune cells that target and kill virus-infected cells, leaving a stew of fluid and dead cells--pus--behind. This is the underlying pathology of pneumonia, with its corresponding symptoms: coughing; fever; and rapid, shallow respiration.  During your innate immunity lecture, we have learned about those first line of white blood cells. Mention the name of those cells here

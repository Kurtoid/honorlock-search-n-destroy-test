(Q001) Texas state government must pass a balanced budget every two years. Sometimes, legislators confront a budgetary deficit when projected expenditures exceed projected revenues. At other times, they face a budgetary surplus when projected revenues exceed projected expenditures. Debating what to do when facing a budgetary surplus tells us much about the choices politicians and special interests face in the politics of the budget.In the 2015 legislative session, state lawmakers faced a budget surplus. Previous comptroller Susan Combs had underestimated the revenues flowing into state coffers for the 2014-15 biennium by $11.3 billion, the worst estimate in 40 years of budgeting. The budgetary windfall led to a lively debate about what to do with the surplus funds. On the one hand, some policy makers, such as Chuck DeVore of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank in the state, argued that the surplus meant that Texas taxpayers had overpaid the state and should receive refunds. On the other hand, Dick Lavine and Eva DeLuna Castro of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank in Austin, argued that cuts to education and health care from the last session should be restored so that the state could better prepare for an uncertain economic future. DeVore countered that education money is spent not on the classroom but on bureaucratic overhead, and he pointed to the fact that the student-teacher ratio in Texas is better than the national average. He also contended that as the legislature spends more on new programs, a sense of entitlement would develop, making it difficult to make cuts later during times of economic difficulty. Lavine and Castro, in turn, responded that Texas was simply not spending enough in real dollars, given the state's rapid growth. With new residents on highways, in classrooms, and in hospitals, the state would need to maintain these public goods for future generations. Spending the same amount of money as when the state's population was smaller, they argued, would not lead to a prosperous state.After considerable wrangling over the best level of funding for existing programs, the legislature passed a two-year budget that represented a 3.6 percent increase from the previous budget. Funding increased for education and border security. The final budget left a surplus of $6.4 billion and did not touch the estimated $11 billion in the Rainy Day Fund. Most importantly for conservative Republicans, property and franchise taxes were cut by $3.8 billion.How should policy makers deal with a projected budgetary surplus? Should taxes be cut or spending increased? If the latter, where should it be increased first?
Extra Credit Question 1.Please indicate the best DSM-V diagnosis for the clinical vignette below, from the information given and (briefly) describe why you decided on that diagnosis. (3 points)  Arnold was a nine-year-old boy referred by his school public health nurse with the following complaints: "disruptive classroom behavior, a discipline problem at home. Outbursts of misbehavior -- seems to lack self-control, especially when not under direct supervision of teacher (hits other children for no reason, rolls on the floor, jumps off chairs). Even under his teacher's direct supervision, he talks out, makes facial grimaces. He gets out of his seat frequently. Even during his 'quiet moments,' he seems tense; cracks his knuckles, plays with buttons on clothes, can't sit still. Has no close friends at school; seems to reject other children's attempts to make friends. He has above average ability, but not working up to that level now." The boy's behavior problems and academic problems had been aggravated by a family move and entrance into a new school. Reports from his previous school revealed, however, that Arnold had never been well adjusted; he had "spit, hit, and had temper tantrums, although he was not mean spirited and could be generous. By his mother's account, which his father tended to contradict, Arnold had always been very active, had been "always into things and on the go," had "no interest span," attentiveness, stick-to-itiveness, and had blown up easily and cried readily. He had marked sibling rivalry; his eleven-year-old brother had always been a model student and son.

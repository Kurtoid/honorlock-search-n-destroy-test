Tom is a 45-year-old male that has lost his ability to hear high frequency sounds. The most likely explanation for this would be ________.
The parasympathetic nervous system innervates the heart's SA node, with increased activity causing the heart rate to [HeartRate]. The parasympathetic stimulus begins in the cardiovascular regulatory center in the [BrainstemLocation], and then action potentials propagate toward the heart along an axon in [Presynaptic] nerve. In contrast to the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic ganglion is located [GanglionLocation]. At the ganglion, the presynaptic neuron releases [PresynapticNT], which crosses the synapse and binds to [PostsynapticR] receptors. This causes [PotentialChange] of the postsynaptic membrane. The postsynaptic neuron releases [PostsynapticNT], which crosses the synapse and binds to [EffectorR] receptors on the SA node, which are [EffectorRType].

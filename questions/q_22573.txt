You attend a summer fair event at which one of the booths is the game "Skee-Ball".  You purchase 3 balls and have 3 opportunities to roll each ball into a centrally located target.  If zero balls hit the target, you will lose a net of $2.  You win a net amount of $1 if you hit the target once, a net amount of $3 if you hit the target twice and a net amount of $5 if you hit the target three times. Define the Random Variable X = Number of times you hit the target, where the PDF is given by: P(X = 0) = 0.5 P(X = 1) = 0.2 P(X = 2) = 0.15 P(X = 3) = 0.15   Compute your expected winnings for each Skee-Ball game (in dollars $).

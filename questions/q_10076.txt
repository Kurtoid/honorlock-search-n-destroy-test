Question 4 Frederick is the office manager for a small law firm, and one of his weekly tasks is to order pastries (bagels, muffins, donuts, or danish) and coffee (hot or iced) for the firm's weekly staff meeting. One of the partners, Karen, is very opinionated and does not like donuts or iced coffee.

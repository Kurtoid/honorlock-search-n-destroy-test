A hospital requires some amount of certain radioactive element, molybdenum-99 (99Mo), for certain procedures. On day  the hospital will be provided with   units of 99Mo (since the material acquisition and storage is heavily regulated, the hospital has no ability to manage the supply side). Further, when stored on site, 99Mo quickly decays at rate 20% per day. Assume that unlimited amount of  99Mo can be stored at the hospital. You need to schedule medical procedures for the planning horizon. The total of  procedures need to be scheduled, each requiring  units of 99Mo. There is a cost of  associated with scheduling a single procedure on day  . Write an LP to determine the optimal scheduling of the procedures. Write the LP model and explain all variables and constraints on your paper.  In the field below, only type one constraint that serves for connecting the amount of 99Mo from one day to the next.

During a polymerization reaction of a 1M solution of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (image shown, molecular weight 116 g/mol) in chloroform using a redox initiator system, you find that the number average molecular weight that you achieve is 80,000 g/mol. What is the kinetic chain length of the chains formed in this reaction if you assume that 15% of the termination events are caused by disproportionation. What concentration of chain transfer agent benzenethiol would be needed to reach a number average molecular weight of 65,000 g/mol, assuming a chain transfer constant of 4? Show your work on scratch paper and write your final answer here.

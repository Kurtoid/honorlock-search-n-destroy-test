You are tasked with enumerating the microbial load of an unknown sample. You begin your investigation by serially diluting the sample resulting in the following dilutions: 10-2, 10-4, and 10-6. You spread 85uL of each dilution onto a separate nutrient agar plate and incubate for 48 hours. Upon examining the plates for the 10-4 and 10-6 dilutions only. You observe the following results:  10-4: 130 CFU  10-6: 12 CFU  Calculate the viable titer for these two agar plates. Report your final answer in the correct notation and with appropriate units.
This is measuring

The Zika virus identified in a recent outbreak in the Americas exhibited intrauterine transmission and was linked to congenital disabilities, including microcephaly and other brain abnormalities.  Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) was also associated with these outbreak isolates. Guillain-Barre syndrome is an autoimmune neurological disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of its peripheral nervous system, causing disease ranging from a very mild case with brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis.  Assume that you have an animal model of GBS in which infecting C57BL/6 with Zika virus can lead to muscle weakness within two days and complete paralysis on day seven after Zika infection.  Design experiments and briefly describe the justification for these experiments to demonstrate that the mechanism for GBS following Zika infection is:  A.  Bystander activation (4 points) B.  Molecular mimicry (4 points)

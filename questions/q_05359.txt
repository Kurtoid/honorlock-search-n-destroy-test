For the given hypothesis test, explain the meaning of a Type I error, a Type II error, or a correct decision as specified.In the past, the mean running time for a certain type of flashlight battery has been 8.8 hours.  The manufacturer has introduced a change in the production method and wants to perform a hypothesis test to determine whether the mean running time has increased as a result. The hypotheses are:H0: m = 8.8 hoursHa: m > 8.8 hourswhere m is the mean running time of the new batteries .  Explain the meaning of a Type II error.

The City of Gotham used to be crime-ridden. Since Batman decided to move in to fight crime in the City of Gotham, the crime rate has dropped dramatically. We know that the residents in the city prefer a low crime rate. Let's assume that statistics show that the crime rate is irrelevant for a firm's productivity. As the crime rate declines, (a) (5 pts) How will the population in Gotham change? (b) (5 pts) How will the house price in Gotham change? (c) (10 pts) How will the wage rate in Gotham change? (d) (30 pts) Now, let's assume that a new study finds that a lower crime rate could lead to higher productivity. Using the Rosen-Roback model framework, draw the firm's isoprofit curve and the household's utility curve (indifference curve). In the new equilibrium, how do the isoprofit curve (firm) and the utility curve (household) change due to a lower crime rate? How does the Rosen-Roback model predict the directions of changes in house prices and wages?

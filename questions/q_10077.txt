This particular Alu element is dimorphic.  Lane 1 is the DNA molecular mass ruler, which contains 1000 bp, 700 bp, 500 bp, 200 bp, & 100 bp fragments.  Lanes 2-4 contain positive controls for different Alu element conditions at this locus.  The Alu sequence is 300 bp long and the two possible PCR products may be 641 bp long and 941 bp long. Which lane contains ONLY a 941 bp DNA fragment.

A deodorant company is launching a new deodorant for athletes. The company wants to ensure that the deodorant packaging does not negatively affect consumer perceptions toward the deodorant. Prior research has shown that deodorant packaging color can affect perceptions of how strong the deodorant scent is. The company conducts A/B testing on the product packaging. They create 2 versions of the packaging. One is grey and one is black. They test each packaging color on a separate sample of athletic consumers who rate the scent strength on a scale from 1 (really weak) to 10 (really strong).  The results show that the average rating for the grey package was 2.3 on the strength scale and the average rating for the black package was 8.3. The t-statistic was 11.46 and the p-value was 0.003. What would you conclude about the black and grey product packaging based on these results?

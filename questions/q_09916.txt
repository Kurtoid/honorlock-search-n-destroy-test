Use the following information to answer the next fifteen questions.The following graph depicts a market where a tax has been imposed. Pe was the equilibrium price before the tax was imposed, and Qe was the equilibrium quantity. After the tax, PC is the price consumers pay, and PS is the price producers receive. QT units are sold after the tax is imposed. NOTE: The areas B and C are rectangles that are divided by the supply curve ST. Include both sections of those rectangles when choosing your answers.  What is the total amount of producer and consumer surplus (i.e., social welfare) in this market after the tax is imposed? Assume Pc - Ps = Ps.

You will use this problem for Questions 3 and 4.  Read carefully!   A basketball, mass 0.62 kg, falls straight down and strikes the floor with a speed of 35 m/s and rebounds straight up with a speed of 27 m/s.  If the ball is in contact with the floor for 0.075 seconds, Q3:  find the magnitude of the average force exerted on the basketball. Q4:  How much kinetic energy was lost during the bounce? For this question, enter the answer to Q3.
8. Bear gallbladder is used in Chinese medicine to treat inflammation.  Due to the difficulty of obtaining bear gallbladder, Chinese medical researchers are searching for a more readily available source.  A study in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology (June 1995) examined pig gallbladder as an effective substitute for bear gallbladder.  Twenty male mice were divided randomly into two groups:  10 were given a dosage bear bile and 10 were given a dosage of pig bile.  All the mice then received an injection of croton oil in the left ear lobe to induce inflammation.  Four hours later, both the left and right ear lobes were weighed, with the difference (in milligrams) representing the degree of swelling.  Summary statistics are provided below: Bear Bile:       n = 10       sample mean = 9.19       s = 4.17 Pig Bile:       n = 10       sample mean = 9.71       s = 3.33 Assume that the populations of the difference of swelling for bear bile and pig bile ears are normally distributed. Construct and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the population mean degree of swelling of mice treated with bear bile and mice treated with pig bile. (c) What is the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval?

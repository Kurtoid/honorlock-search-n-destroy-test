QUESTIONS 15 - 31: ARGUMENT           #15 [15] The federal Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") requires employers to make "reasonable accommodations" to the physical and mental limitations of their otherwise qualified employees. 42 U.S.C. SS 12112(b)(5)(A) (2018). #16 [16] For decades, federal courts have grappled with the reasonableness of employee requests to work remotely. See, e.g., Mosby-Meachem v. Memphis Light, Gas & Water Div., 883 F.3d 595 (6th Cir. 2018) (affirming trial judgment in favor of attorney who needed to work remotely due to pregnancy complications); Vande Zande v. Wis. Dep't of Admin., 44 F.3d 538 (7th Cir. 1995) (rejecting accommodation claim by employee who lacked necessary equipment to perform job duties from home). #17 [17] But the Seventh Circuit has taken an unduly restrictive view of remote work, holding that such an accommodation would be reasonable only in a "very extraordinary case." Id. at 545. #18 [18] This court should repudiate this standard and rule that appellant Cameron Delaney's request to work remotely for appellee Zeplin Technologies was reasonable. Polewski v. Wu,  138 F. Supp. 3d 1499, 1501 (W.D. Wis. 2015).           #19 [19] The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of disability, such as by failing to provide reasonable accommodations to an "otherwise qualified individual." Wis. Stat. SS 230.018 (2019-20); McAllister v. Innovation Ventures, LLC, 983 F.3d 963, 967 (7th Cir. 2020). #20 [20] The statute defines "qualified individual" to refer to any person who "can perform the essential functions of the employment position" either "with or without reasonable accommodation." 29 C.F.R. SS 1630.2(g). #21 [21] "The term 'reasonable accommodation' may include . . . job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules" and "other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." See 42 U.S.C. SS 12111(9)(B).            #22 [22] The reasonableness of work-from-home requests is ultimately a question of competence: working remotely is reasonable only when an employee demonstrates that she can "effectively perform her work from home." #23 [23] In Mosby-Meachem, the Sixth Circuit ruled in favor of an accomplished in-house attorney who needed to work from home during a difficult pregnancy.  Mosby-Meachem v. Memphis Light, Gas & Water Div., 883 F.3d 595 (6th Cir. 2018). #24 [24] The court held that the plaintiff had "presented sufficient evidence supporting a finding that she could perform all the essential functions of her job remotely for ten weeks." Id.           #25 [25] Some positions do impose unique demands that can make remote work difficult. #26 [26] In one case, a software engineer's request to work entirely from home was deemed unreasonable because the "central components of her job required her to be at the office." Rauen, 319 F.3d at 897. #27 [27] Similarly, the Eighth Circuit highlighted the difficulties of teaching remotely when it rejected a professor's accommodation request as unreasonable. Polewski, 138 F. Supp. 3d at 1503.           #28 [28] Despite the importance of such case-by-case analysis, Judge Posner injected unnecessary uncertainty into this equation by observing that "it would take a very extraordinary case for the employee to be able to create a triable issue of the employer's failure to allow the employee to work at home." Vande Zande, 44 F.3d at 545. #29 [29] Employers, Judge Posner explained, do not have to let their disabled employees work out of their homes, where their productivity would probably decline significantly. Id. ("An employer is not required to allow disabled workers to work at home, where their productivity inevitably would be greatly reduced."). #30 [30] Within the Seventh Circuit, questions have surfaced regarding the viability of Judge Posner's view. See, e,g., Mobley v. Allstate Ins. Co., 531 F.3d 539 (7th Cir. 2008) (Wood, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (criticizing majority's refusal to allow ADA claim to proceed to trial).           #31 [31] The folly of that standard has been exposed by the remote work revolution induced by the pandemic. 42 U.S.C. SS 12112(b)(5)(A).

In this passage, comedian and television host Conan O'Brien speaks at a high school graduation. Commencement Believe it or not, I actually do have some real advice for you. I don't want to freak you out, but twenty-five years ago I could have been any one of you. I was a bright, 5 ambitious, hard-working kid who wanted more than anything to go to a good college. The only problem is that I was much more interested in succeeding than in really learning. So I did a lot of things 10 in high school not because I enjoyed them but because I thought they'd look good on an application. I was going to turn college into just another step on the road to being successful, whatever that 15 meant. And then something weird happened. My roommate was going to an orientation meeting at the school humor magazine, and I decided, for some reason, to tag 20 along. I wrote one piece, then another, then another, and before long I was running the place. The only difference was, I was joyously happy. I was succeeding at something because I loved 25 the process, not because I was trying to get anywhere. I had found the thing I wanted to do for the rest of my life, and I honestly didn't care where it took me or what it paid. 30 So when I graduated from college in 1985, I told my parents, "Thanks for the amazing Ivy League education. Now I want to be a comedian." Later, in the emergency room, after they woke up, 35 they said they were fine with my decision, and I was on my way. If I hadn't allowed myself to experiment and risk doing something without a clear career payoff, I would have missed out on so 40 much. I never would have written for Saturday Night Live. I wouldn't have performed onstage in Chicago in a diaper in 1988. I never would have spent hours crafting the Homer Simpson line "The 45 bee bit my bottom and now my bottom is big." The point is, at this moment many of you have ideas of what you want to do with your lives, but for many of you those 50 ideas will change. And that's because you think you know who you are right now, but you don't. Trust me. When I look back at eighteen-year-old Conan, it's a ridiculous sight. Six feet four, of 55 pale skin and bone. Scared of girls. Squeaky voice. Wait, I'm sorry, that's forty-three-year-old Conan. But life and the choices I've made have changed me in a thousand ways. And none of it would 60 have happened if I had rigidly "kept my eye on the prize" or decided, with great determination, to "follow my dream." I didn't have the slightest idea what my dream was when I was eighteen. It had 65 to find me.     Adapted from Conan O'Brien, "Stuyvesant High School Commencement Speech." (c) 2006 by Conan O'Brien.   The style of writing that the author uses in this passage is ________, why?

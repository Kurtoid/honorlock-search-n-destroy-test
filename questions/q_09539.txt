When writing this exam, I attempted to effectively cover material that we have learned so far this quarter. But with the limitations of a 2 hour exam, you have assuredly studied and learned a lot more than I could possibly cover in this exam! Please consider any single topic you learned about that I didn't ask you about on this exam, name the topic, and then carefully explain that topic here. If you can't think of anything you studied that I didn't cover, or you think I covered everything, please instead just pick any topic you learned about and explain it to me.

Please do not just list names of multiple topics, or just tell me you found [name of topic] to be really interesting. You may tell me [name of topic] was really interesting, but you must demonstrate to me that you learned about and understand the topic by explaining to me how it works. Relax, and please don't stress - this is your chance to choose your own topic/question and show me you learned something from this course by telling me about it - i.e., this is meant to be a very gentle last question on this exam! :)

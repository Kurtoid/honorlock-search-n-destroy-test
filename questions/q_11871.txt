Control of the disease caused by the Eastern Equine Encephalomyelitis (EEE) virus requires a good understanding of which vectors are most important in transmitting the EEE virus to the different hosts. There are six species of mosquitoes in Alabama carrying this virus. A DNA analysis of a sample of blood-engorged female mosquitoes of the species Ae. vexans shows that 35 of the 81 mosquitoes have fed on mammals. Let p be the probability that a mosquito of the species Ae. vexans feeds on mammals. Calculate the p-value for the test H0 : p = 1/3 vs. HA : p [?] 1/3 using the R function prop.test(). Report your answer to 4 digits after the decimal point.

A team of researchers conducted a randomized control trial with a wait-list control condition for a new drug treatment for anxiety. Random assignment was used before the experiment to separate participants into two groups matched in symptoms, durations, intensities, backgrounds, and other variables.

Sodium metal reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide according to the chemical equation shown below. When 0.575 g of Na is added to 100.00 g of water, the temperature of the resulting solution rises from 25.00degC to 35.75degC. If the specific heat of the solution is 4.18 J/(g [?] degC), calculate DH for the reaction, as written. 2 Na(s) + 2 H2O(l) - 2 NaOH(aq) + H2(g) DH = ?  1. Find the heat (q) of the solution using q = m Cs DT. (3 points) 2. Find the heat (q) of the reaction. (2 points) 3. Calculate the moles of the limiting reactant. (2 points) 4. Calculate the DH of the reaction in units of kJ/mol of limiting reactant. (2 points)

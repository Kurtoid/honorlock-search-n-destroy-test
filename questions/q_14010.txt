An instructional resources company claims to have a method to train students which will increase their scores on any standardized test. Concerned that their admission process would be adversely affected, a large university decides to test this claim. The registrar selects, using a method which is independent and random, a group of n =200 high school students. This group is randomly divided in two, n1=100 students are sent to be trained to increase their test scores and n2=100 students are shown an inspirational movie to act as a control group.             After training both groups are administered an old PDQ. test, the following results are obtained Sample mean 1=257 and sample mean 2=249. To interpret the results the following assumptions are made:               a. The distribution of the scores before training was normal N (250, 50)            b.      Any changes due to training represent a change in the location of the mean                      rather the shape of the distribution, hence s1 = s2 = 50   Test Ho: u1 = u2 vs. Ha: u1 > u2  at the a =.05 level of significance.   The following triple (z-score, p-value, Your Conclusion) is produced when the data is properly input in to your calculator.

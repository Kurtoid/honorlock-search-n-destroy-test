Below is the diagram illustrating the regulation of erythropoietin secretion in response to oxygen concentrations in the blood.    A. Based on the above diagram, does the secretion of erythropoietin follows a positive or a negative loop?  Explain your reasoning. (1 pts.) B. What mode of secretion does erythropoietin follows: hormonal, humoral, or neuronal. Explain your reasoning. (1 pts.) C. Bob decides to move from Chicago and live in the mountains of Tibet. At regions of higher altitude such as mountains of Tibet oxygen concentrations are much lower than at lower altitudes such as Chicago. Over time would concentration of erythropoietin increase, decrease, or stay the same in Bob's blood? Explain your reasoning. (1 pts.) D. Over time what would happen to Bob's total peripheral resistance to blood flow (increase, decrease, or stay the same) as a consequence to changes in erythropoietin secretion? Explain your reasoning (1 pts.) E. What would happen to Bob's cardiac output and what will happen to diameter of his blood vessels (increase, decrease, or stay the same) when he moves to higher altitude? Explain your reasoning (describe the activating factor and receptor involved as well as output and neurotransmitter released from brain and effects at heart level and blood vessels level). (3 pts.)

The rigid bar shown is supported by link AB and the pinned support at C (its connection detail is shown). Pins A and B are in single shear.  All pins have a diameter of  1/2 ", member AB is 1.5" wide x  1/2 " thick, the rigid bar is 2" wide x  1/2 " thick, and the gusset plates supporting pin C are  1/4 " thick.  All of the components are made of the same material whose failure normal stress is 60 ksi, failure shear stress is 54 ksi, and failure bearing stress is 56 ksi.  Using a factor of safety of 1.8, determine the maximum force P that may be safely supported, considering only the following failure modes:  Tensile failure of link AB. Shear failure of pin C. Bearing failure between pin C and the gusset plates that support it  Write your answer on paper.  You don't have to put an answer in the box given on Canvas for this problem.

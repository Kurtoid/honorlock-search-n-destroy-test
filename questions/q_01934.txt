A see-saw is made by pivoting a uniform 4 m long board at a pivot point 1.5 m from one of its ends, as shown in the figure. The board has a mass of 50 kg, James has a mass of 40 kg and sits at the left end, and Emily has a mass of 20 kg and sits at the right end.    a) What distance D to the left of the pivot should Cathy, whose mass is 30 kg, sit in order for the see-saw to be balanced (i.e. in static equilibrium)? [parta] b) If Cathy gains some weight, but the other kids do not, how would her position have to change to keep the see-saw balanced? [partb]

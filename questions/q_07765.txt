Preoperative Diagnosis: Right scaphoid fracture Type of Procedure: Open reduction and internal fixation of right scaphoid fracture. Description of Procedure: The patient was brought to the operating room, anesthesia having been administered.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The limb was elevated, exsanguinated, and a pneumatic arm tourniquet was applied.  An incision was made over the dorsal radial aspect of the right wrist.  Skin flaps were elevated.  Cutaneous nerve branches were identified and very gently retracted.  The interval between the second and third dorsal compartment tendons was identified and entered.  The respective tendons were retracted.  A dorsal capsulotomy incision was made, and the fracture was visualized.  There did not appear to be any type of significant defect at the fracture site.  A 0.045 Kirschner wire was then used as a guidewire, extending from the proximal pole of the scaphoid distal ward.  The guidewire was positioned appropriately and then measured.  A 25-mm Acutrak drill bit was drilled to 25 mm.  A 22.5 mm screw was selected and inserted and rigid internal fixation was accomplished in this fashion.  This was visualized under the OEC imaging device in multiple projections.  The wound was irrigated and closed in layers.  Sterile dressings were then applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition.  What CPT code is reported for this procedure?

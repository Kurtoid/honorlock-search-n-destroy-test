Read the paragraph then answer the questions below.                                                   How to Pack a Suitcase         Most people take big suitcases when they travel because they do not really know how topack. The first mistake that most people make is this: They fold their clothes. However, clothesshould not be folded. Instead, they should be rolled up like little sausages. When clothes are rolledup, the amount of space needed is significantly reduced. In addition, unlike folded clothes, rolledclothes do not look messy after unpacking them. The next mistake people make is that they bring toomany clothes, and especially, too many shoes. Most people do not need more than three pairs ofshoes on any trip. It is best to wear the heaviest pair and pack the other two pairs. Most suitcasesare too heavy to carry on a plane. Be sure to use the space inside each shoe to pack small items, forexample, socks, gloves, sunglasses, or small electronic devices. Finally, people should think about thetrip before they start packing. They should ask themselves, "What will I need first? What clotheswill I need later in the trip?" The items needed at the beginning of the trip should be packed on top.Following these suggestions for packing will make any trip easier and more enjoyable!

1.

(0.5 points)         (A) smaller, larger         (B) smaller, smaller         (C) larger, larger         (D) smaller, more random         (E) larger, more random     (5) When conducting an ANOVA, FVALUE (CALCULATED ) will always fall within what range? (0.5 points)         (A) between negative infinity and infinity         (B) between 0 and 1         (C) between 0 and infinity         (D) between 1 and infinity     (6) If FDATA follows an F distribution with df1=4 and df2=5, what is the boundary value of F where P(FDATA < F) = 0.95?

Then choose the correct answer:  (0.5 points)                   I: H0 should be rejected.                   II : The significance level is given by the area to the left of 9.48773 under the appropriate F distribution.                   III : The significance level is given by the area to the right of 9.48773 under the appropriate F distribution.

The students live in a controlled environment for one week, on the third day of the experimental treatment is administered (study of predetermined material). On the seventh day the investigator tests for retention. In computing his ANOVA table, he sees that his MS within groups is larger than his MS between groups. What does this result indicate? (1 point)         (A) An error in the calculations was made.         (B) There was more than the expected amount of variability between groups.         (C) There was more variability between subjects within the same group than there was between groups.         (D) There should have been additional controls in the experiment. 2.

QUESTIONS 15 - 31: ARGUMENT           #15 [15] The federal Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") requires employers to make "reasonable accommodations" to the physical and mental limitations of their otherwise qualified employees. 42 U.S.C. SS 12112(b)(5)(A) (2018). #16 [16] For decades, federal courts have grappled with the reasonableness of employee requests to work remotely. See, e.g., Mosby-Meachem v. Memphis Light, Gas & Water Div., 883 F.3d 595 (6th Cir. 2018) (affirming trial judgment in favor of attorney who needed to work remotely due to pregnancy complications); Vande Zande v. Wis. Dep't of Admin., 44 F.3d 538 (7th Cir. 1995) (rejecting accommodation claim by employee who lacked necessary equipment to perform job duties from home). #17 [17] But the Seventh Circuit has taken an unduly restrictive view of remote work, holding that such an accommodation would be reasonable only in a "very extraordinary case." Id. at 545. #18 [18] This court should repudiate this standard and rule that appellant Cameron Delaney's request to work remotely for appellee Zeplin Technologies was reasonable. Polewski v. Wu,  138 F. Supp. 3d 1499, 1501 (W.D. Wis. 2015).           #19 [19] The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of disability, such as by failing to provide reasonable accommodations to an "otherwise qualified individual." Wis. Stat. SS 230.018 (2019-20); McAllister v. Innovation Ventures, LLC, 983 F.3d 963, 967 (7th Cir. 2020). #20 [20] The statute defines "qualified individual" to refer to any person who "can perform the essential functions of the employment position" either "with or without reasonable accommodation." 29 C.F.R. SS 1630.2(g). #21 [21] "The term 'reasonable accommodation' may include . . . job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules" and "other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." See 42 U.S.C. SS 12111(9)(B).            #22 [22] The reasonableness of work-from-home requests is ultimately a question of competence: working remotely is reasonable only when an employee demonstrates that she can "effectively perform her work from home." #23 [23] In Mosby-Meachem, the Sixth Circuit ruled in favor of an accomplished in-house attorney who needed to work from home during a difficult pregnancy.  Mosby-Meachem v. Memphis Light, Gas & Water Div., 883 F.3d 595 (6th Cir. 2018). #24 [24] The court held that the plaintiff had "presented sufficient evidence supporting a finding that she could perform all the essential functions of her job remotely for ten weeks." Id.           #25 [25] Some positions do impose unique demands that can make remote work difficult. #26 [26] In one case, a software engineer's request to work entirely from home was deemed unreasonable because the "central components of her job required her to be at the office." Rauen, 319 F.3d at 897. #27 [27] Similarly, the Eighth Circuit highlighted the difficulties of teaching remotely when it rejected a professor's accommodation request as unreasonable. Polewski, 138 F. Supp. 3d at 1503.           #28 [28] Despite the importance of such case-by-case analysis, Judge Posner injected unnecessary uncertainty into this equation by observing that "it would take a very extraordinary case for the employee to be able to create a triable issue of the employer's failure to allow the employee to work at home." Vande Zande, 44 F.3d at 545. #29 [29] Employers, Judge Posner explained, do not have to let their disabled employees work out of their homes, where their productivity would probably decline significantly. Id. ("An employer is not required to allow disabled workers to work at home, where their productivity inevitably would be greatly reduced."). #30 [30] Within the Seventh Circuit, questions have surfaced regarding the viability of Judge Posner's view. See, e,g., Mobley v. Allstate Ins. Co., 531 F.3d 539 (7th Cir. 2008) (Wood, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (criticizing majority's refusal to allow ADA claim to proceed to trial).           #31 [31] The folly of that standard has been exposed by the remote work revolution induced by the pandemic. 42 U.S.C. SS 12112(b)(5)(A).

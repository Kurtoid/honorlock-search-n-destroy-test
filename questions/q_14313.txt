Question 3. [25 points] Weekly demand for coffee at a local roastery is as shown in Table 3. a. [10 points] Assume that the forecast made for the first week at the end of week 0 was 235. Estimate demand for week 2 through 13 using the simple exponential smoothing method with a=0.2. Evaluate the MAD, MAPE, and MSE for week 1 through 12. b. [15 points] Suppose that the initial estimates for the intercept and the slope are 230 and 5 units, respectively. Use the double exponential smoothing method to provide the demand forecasts for week 1 through 13 using a=0.2 and b=0.1. Evaluate the MAD, MAPE, and MSE for week 1 through 12. Table 3.

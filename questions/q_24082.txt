The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a process which generates random outcomes. The sample space is denoted S. All outcomes in S are equally likely.             Flip three coins. We can order the coins by using distinct fair coins The possible outcomes are: S = {(H,H,H), (H,H,T), (H,T,H), (T,H,H), (H,T,T), (T,H,T), (T,T,H), (T,T,T)}. These eight outcomes constitute the sample space. Consider the three events:   A = {Get a T on the first coin.}= {(T,H,H), (T,H,T), (T,T,H), (T,T,T)}   B = {Get a H on the third coin.}= {(H,H,H), (H,T,H), (T,H,H), (T,T,H)}    AOB = {Get a T on the first coin and a H on the third coin.}= {(T, H, H), (T, T, H)}   Using the previously calculated probabilities. In problems 6, 7 & 8, Are the events A and B independent?

(c)  What advantage does the cell gain by maintaining a cytosolic concentration of G-actin that is higher than the critical concentration?  (d)  How does the polarity of actin affect the critical concentration of the filament?  (e) What other parameter of actin polymerization is affected by the polarity of actin?

For the following 4 questions, write a class called TigerZoo to represent the characteristics and capabilities of a zoo. Type your code for each method described in the box provided. Some test cases are given below to show the output after all four methods are completed.  >>> zooA = TigerZoo("GW Zoo", 650, ["South China Tiger", "Siberian Tiger"])>>> zooB = TigerZoo("Big Cat Rescue", 700, ["Bengal Tiger"])>>> zooA.tradeTigers(zooB)>>> print(zooA)GW Zoo has 1 tiger(s), and it costs $650 to see them.>>> print(zooB)Big Cat Rescue has 2 tiger(s), and it costs $700 to see them.  Method 1 Write a method to initialize a new TigerZoo object. A TigerZoo object should have a name (str), a pricePerEntry (int), and a tigerList (list) as attributes. All attributes  should take their values from a parameter, but tigerList should have a default value of an empty list [] in case no value for it is passed into the initialization function.
Let W represent the sum of the ranks for the New Method. Find W.

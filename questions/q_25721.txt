A suspension of yeast cells is being grown under anaerobic conditions such that glucose is degraded to ethanol and carbon dioxide.Adding an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase to the yeast cell suspension results in rapid cell death. Why?   a) Pyruvate is no longer being produced for use in gluconeogenesis, so the cells quickly deplete this energy source.   b) Loss of this enzyme during anaerobic glucose degradation leads to an increased requirement for ATP, which cannot be met.   c) NADH generated during glycolysis cannot be recycled back to NAD+, thus anaerobic ATP production through glycolysis cannot be maintained.   d) Without alcohol dehydrogenase, the acetaldehyde concentration increases to levels that are toxic to the yeast cells.

Income Tax Calculator Write a C program to calculate income tax due for an individual taxpayer based on the entered taxable income by using the information in the following table: Table: Tax Brackets and Income Tax Rates    If Taxable Income Is Between: The Tax Due Is:   $0 - $9,875 10% of taxable income   $9,876 - $40,125 $987.50 plus 12% of the amount over $9,875   $40,126 - $85,525 $4,617.50 plus 22% of the amount over $40,125   $85,526 - $163,300 $14,605.50 plus 24% of the amount over $85,525    Example: If an individual earned the taxable income of $10,000: Tax Due = $987.50 + 12% of ($10,000 - $9,875) =   $1002.50 The program should ask the user to enter the taxable income amount and then display the tax due amount with 2 decimal places. If the entered amount is less than $0 or greater than $163,300, the program should display a message "Invalid amount entered!" (no need to repeat asking the user for the new value.) The examples of the input/output dialog are shown below: Enter the amount of your taxable income: 10000Your tax due amount is 1002.50 or Enter the amount of your taxable income: 125850Your tax due amount is 24283.50 or Enter the amount of your taxable income: -2000Invalid amount entered!

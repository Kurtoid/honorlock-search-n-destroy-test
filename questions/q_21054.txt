Email #1   Daisy's Dry Cleaners TO:         Laura.Taylor@Daisys.com (Operations manager) FROM:   Sig.Franklin@Daisys.com (Clerk) CC:         Mitch.Clifton@Daisys.com (Shift supervisor) DATE:    Monday, November 10 RE:        Customer items missing Laura, Two angry customers with large orders complained this morning when their pick-up orders were incomplete. One customer claimed he dropped off 25 items and the other claimed she dropped off 32 items. How can we more quickly count items, especially for the larger orders? Sincerely, Sig               Email #2   Daisy's Dry Cleaners TO:         (M2a)_______________________________ FROM:   Laura.Taylor@Daisys.com (Operations Manager) DATE:    Wednesday, November 12 RE:         Counting customer items   (M2a) ____________________, To follow-up our conversation this morning, our new clerk emailed that larger orders  have recently had missing items. As you mentioned, other clerks you supervise have also received complaints from customers about missing items in larger orders. I propose that we invest in an RFID system that in seconds can count tagged items in customer orders as well as our typical on-site inventory of over 900 items. The RFID system requires both a handheld reader and waterproof RFID tags for each item counted. Table 1 shows the costs for six low-cost RFID options. I recommend RFID model (M2b)________________ based on (M2c)___________________________________. Table 1  Equipment for Counting Tagged Inventory    Equipment Handheld reader purchase cost Tag purchase cost   RFID #R35 $799 $2.33/tag   RFID #R36 $949 $2.40/tag   RFID #R37 $1,199 $1.69/tag   RFID #R38 $1,209 $1.89/tag   RFID #R39 $1,229 $1.99/tag   RFID #R40 $1,232 $1.95/tag    Attached are diagrams of the current sequence of steps to count items versus the proposed sequence with an RFID system. Are there any other features to consider before I prepare the procurement request the end of this week for Juan's (general manager) review? Sincerely, Laura Attachment:  Current Sequence:    Proposed Sequence:    The diagrams are repeated below using keyboard characters.

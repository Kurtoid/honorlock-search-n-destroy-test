Arlington Inc. purchased a delivery truck on July 1, 2020 for $50,000. The truck has an estimated useful life of five years, an estimated residual value of $5,000, and the company expects the truck will be driven 150,000 miles over its useful life. Assuming the company depreciates the equipment using the units of production depreciation method and the truck was driven 20,000 miles during 2020 and 30,000 miles during 2021, the balance in Accumulated Depreciation on December 31, 2021 would be:

(4) (18 points) The cantilever beam shown below has a "T" shaped cross section made of two different materials. The bending moment diagram associated with the loading is provided. The elastic moduli of the materials are:  E1 = 70 MPa and E2 = 105 MPa. (a) Draw a picture of your transformed cross-section with dimensions labeled. (b) Calculate the moment of intertia for your transformed cross-section. (c) Determine the maximum tensile stress on the top of the beam (point X).
A population of squirrels inhabiting South Florida was severely affected by a surge of great eagles, which are considered one of their biggest predators. This led to nearly  3/4  of the population dying. After this occurred, we would like to study whether the survivors were affected by inbreeding. Data was collected on the optimal speed of squirrels in this population. FF(fast)= 17FS(medium speed)= 9SS(slow)= 13The population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. If we consider these results Generation 1, what are the expected number of individuals for each genotype in Generation 3 if we have only inbreeding, that is, FF only reproduces with FF; FS only reproduces with FS; and SS only reproduces with SS? FF = [FF] FS = [FS] SS = [SS]

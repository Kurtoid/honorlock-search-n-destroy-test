McKnight uses women in ministry as a test case for his method of interpreting the Bible.  In this essay you will demonstrate how you interpret the Bible with respect to the topic of women in ministry (i.e. women leading churches as pastors), in light of our investigation of McKnight's book. Explain, analyze, and assess McKnight's argument: based on his approach in Parts 1-3, how does he develop his argument in Part 5?  Is he consistent; does he make a strong case; what are his strengths and weaknesses; is he persuasive; what is your position based on your interpretation and research? Strong papers will document a careful use of the key ideas from McKnight's book.  (Use your notes and the chapter summaries to direct you to key places in his book).  Be sure to give page numbers when referencing McKnight's key ideas.  Strong papers will consider carefully the key scriptures that McKnight uses in his argument. Extra sources are not necessary, but you may use the videos and resources found in Canvas. Open book.  You may bring a one page outline (not a pre-written essay) to class. A minimum essay that answers the question will be at least a standard 5 paragraph essay, but some well-prepared essays may be much longer.

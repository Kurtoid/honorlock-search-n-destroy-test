A positive point charge q1{"version":"1.1","math":"q1"} creates an electric field of magnitude E1{"version":"1.1","math":"E1"} at a spot located at a distance r1{"version":"1.1","math":"r1"} from the charge. The charge is replaced by another positive point chargeq2{"version":"1.1","math":"q2"}, which creates a field of magnitude E2=E1{"version":"1.1","math":"E2=E1"} at a distance of r2=2r1{"version":"1.1","math":"r2=2r1"}. How is q2{"version":"1.1","math":"q2"} related to q1{"version":"1.1","math":"q1"}?

NOTE: Canvas will only allow you to upload ONE file, so it is recommended that all your answers fit onto one page. Free Response Question #1 (5 pts.,  Answer in the top half of your page) What is the volume in liters of an 287.5 g iron block, if the density of iron is 7.874 g/mL?    Show calculation using conversion factors, and express your answer in scientific notation with correct significant figures.   Free Response Question #2 (5 pts. Answer in the bottom half of your page). An adult 143.2 lb. patient with rheumatoid arthritis requires medication with a recommended daily dosage of 0.0850 mg per kg body weight.  The medicine comes in the form of a solution with a concentration of 0.600 mg medicine per mL of solution.  If this medicine is injected into the patient once a day, how many milliliters of the solution should be loaded into the syringe for administration?  1 lb. = 0.4536 kg.   Show all work using conversion factors to solve the problem.  Report answer with the correct significant figures.

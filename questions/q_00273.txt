Black-box testing  The command C searches the contents of a text file, F, for a pattern, P. The output of C is every line in F that contains a string that matches pattern P. The pattern P is a string, which may contain English letters (A..Z, a..z), digits (0..9), and wildcards (*, ?). When the wildcard character "*" is used in the pattern, it must occur after an English letter or digit (e.g., "a*") but not a wildcard character. The pattern is a successful match in a line in the file if there are one or more consecutive occurrences of the letter "a" in the line. When the wildcard character "?" is used in the pattern, it must occur after an English letter or digit (e.g., "a?") but not a wildcard character. The pattern matches one character "a" in any line in the file. The line "This is a green salad" matches the patterns "reen", "re*n", and "gre?en". The line does not match the patterns "gl?e*n", or "gre?n". Using your knowledge of black-box testing with input space partitioning and boundary values, design test inputs for the command C. Remember to describe the different types of values for both (1) the contents of file F and (2) pattern P. Note that we need a description of the contents of the file, not the name of the file.

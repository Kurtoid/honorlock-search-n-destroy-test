TBD (shown below) is a bicyclic organic molecule that belongs to the class of guanidines. It is used in organic synthesis as a strong non-nucleophilic (bulky) base, among other things. Consider the following dehydrohalogenation reaction using TBD.  Determine whether each ring substituent would be axial or equatorial in the REACTIVE conformation of the starting material. The bromine atom would be [bromine]. The methyl group would be [methyl]. The isopropyl group would be [isopropyl]. Which of the following (P1-P6) is the expected major product of the reaction?

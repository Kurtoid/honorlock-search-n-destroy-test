You are working with a 2-year-old child. The child presents with a language impairment. Her vocabulary is less than 10 words and she has only 3 vowels /a, u, ^  / and 3 consonants / w, j, m /. Your objectives from the plan of care include:  Child will play with objects appropriately  During therapy the child shows a preference for mouthing, banging or sensorimotor exploration of the toys (primitive) rather than using objects appropriately (e.g., eating plastic pretend foods), using objects and that show their relationship (e.g., using the fork to mix). Briefly explain why this objective is important for a young child who presents with a language impairment: Correct Answer: A child who does not know how to play with objects in productive (meaningful or symbolic) ways is unlikely to learn to communicate about objects and events in an appropriate manner. Remember world knowledge vs. word knowledge.  Consider what you know about prelinguistic communication, turn-taking and social reciprocity, why are all those so important.
11. A kitchen design firm builds cabinets on a make-to-order basis for new-home construction. Both holding inventory and backorders are allowed. In June 2018, there is currently a backorder of 100 cabinets. The demand for July through December of 2018 is shown in the table below. The regular-time production cost is $590 per cabinet, the overtime production cost is $885 per cabinet, the cost of holding a cabinet in inventory is $84 per cabinet, and the cost of backordering a cabinet is $95 per cabinet. The number of cabinets in inventory may never decrease by more than 10% from one month to the next, and the number of cabinets in inventory at the end of December must be 0. The number of backordered cabinets may never increase by more than 10% from one month to the next, and the number of backordered cabinets at the end of December must be 0. Regular-time production must be the same in each of the six months of the planning horizon and overtime production in a given month is limited to no more than 40% of the regular time production level. Build a linear programming model for the aggregate plan that will minimize the sum of backorder costs + inventory costs + regular-time production costs + overtime production costs for the six-month planning period.    Month July August September October November December   Demand 400 700 1000 600 400 300

A patient has been admitted to the hospital with a reported symptom of being "unable to walk due to generalized muscle weakness". The initial tentative diagnosis is a motor neuropathy, but extensive nerve and electromyography recordings reveal normal neurological and muscle electrical properties. It is evident that the patient has muscle mass lower than normal. However, tests with nerve and muscle stimulation show normal maximal isometric force normalized to muscle mass (cross sectional area). Examination of gait confirm that the patient has trouble walking, and further tests show two important features: 1) decreased voluntary and electrically-stimulated submaximal isometric force normalized to muscle size/area, and 2) abnormal maximal isotonic properties (loss of peak power and maximal shortening velocity, both normalized to muscle size and length). Based on these observations, you can deduce the following:

Table 1: Location quotients for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA Metropolitan Statistical Areas from the BLS.          Table 2: Location quotients for the Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-SC Metropolitan Statistical Areas from the BLS.          The questions in this section are about the BLS data for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA (LA MSA) and the Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-SC (Charlotte MSA) Metropolitan Statistical Areas location quotients, presented in Tables 1 and 2. Use the employment location quotient to answer the questions (as you have done in Homework Assignment 4). This data has not been sorted by the Location Quotient as in your Homework Assignment 4. Choose one option to indicate the best answer.  Some questions have answers that include aggregated responses, such as "both A and B are correct". Be sure to read all answers before finalizing your choice.       1. [2 points] Determine the specialization of the LA and Charlotte MSAs relative to the U.S. in Health care and Arts:  Both the LA and Charlotte MSAs specialize in Health care and Arts. The LA MSA specializes in both Health care and Arts, but the Charlotte MSA only specializes in Health care. The Charlotte MSA specializes in both Health care and Arts, but not the LA MSA. The LA MSA specializes in Arts, and the Charlotte MSA specializes in Health care. The LA MSA specializes in both Health care and Arts, but the Charlotte MSA only specializes in Arts.    2. [2 points] The industry in Table 2 for which the Charlotte MSA has the proportion of the employment that is the most similar to the share of employment for the US is   Construction. Other services, except public administration. Only Accommodation and food services. Only Retail trade. Both Accommodation and food services and Retail trade.    3. [2 points] The industry in Table 1 for which the LA MSA has the proportion of the employment that differs the most from the share of employment for the US is  Management of companies and enterprises. Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction. Accommodation and food services. Information. None of the above.    4. [2 points] If an insurance company expects to enjoy significant benefits from agglomeration economies, which MSA out of these two, should the firm choose based on the employment location quotient alone?  The LA MSA. The Charlotte MSA. Both MSAs will bring significant agglomeration economies. None of MSAs will bring significant agglomeration economies.

James purchased liability insurance with a $100,000 limit from Insurer A. When Insurer A denied a claim that James thought should be covered, he bought a second liability insurance policy with a $150,000 limit from Insurer B. Before he cancelled the policy with Insurer A, a $60,000 loss occurred. If this loss is settled on a pro rata basis, how much must each insurer pay?

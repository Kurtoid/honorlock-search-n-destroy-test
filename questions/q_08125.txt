Order the steps in the direct proof of the statement: if x is an even integer and y is an odd integers, then (x + y)2 is odd. Note that you do not need to use all the steps given.  Assume (x+y)2 is even. Therefore we can write (x+y)2 = (2a+(2b+1))2 = (2a+2b+1)2. Because a and b are integers, 2a2 + 4ab + 2b2 + 2a + 2b is also some integer z. The expression (2a+2b+1)2 expands to 4a2 + 4b2 + 1.    The expression (2a+2b+1)2 expands to 4a2 + 8ab + 4b2 + 4a + 4b + 1 = 2(2a2 + 4ab + 2b2 + 2a + 2b) + 1. Because a and b are integers, 4a2 + 4b2 + 1 is also some integer z. Therefore (x+y)2= 2z+1 for some integer z, so (x+y)2 is odd. Because x is even, there is an integer a where x=2a. Because y is odd, there is an integer b where y=2b+1.

Question from textbook -- with different progeny numbers Waxy endosperm (a), shrunken endosperm (b) and yellow seedlings (d) are encoded by three recessive genes in corn that are linked on Chromosome 5.  A corn plant homozygous for all three recessive alleles is crossed with a plant homozygous for all the dominant alleles.  The resulting F1 are then crossed with a plant homozygous for the recessive alleles in a three point test cross. The progeny from the test cross are: a    b    D        292 A   B    d          280 A   B   D         668 a   b    d         674 A   b   D       2010 a   B   d       2014 a   B   D           30 A   b   d           32                     ----------                      6000   Based on the progeny data, the order of the 3 loci on chromosome 5 is most likely [order2] Based on the progeny data, the distance between the A locus and the B locus is closest to [distance3] Based on the progeny data, the distance between the B locus and the D locus is closest to [distance4]

Question 3 (20 points): Forging The heights of two identical cylindrical metal blocks (A and B) are being reduced via open die forging. The average pressure (pav) over the die surfaces corresponding to the instantaneous values of radius (r) and height (h) is found to be as shown in the chart below. The initial height of the blocks is 13.5 mm, initial diameter is 40 mm, final height is 6 mm, and the yield strength (Y) is 140 MPa. The coefficient of friction (u) at the die-block interface is 0.2 for block A and zero for block B. Answer the following questions. Show all work and list any assumptions.    (a) Is the material of the blocks perfectly plastic or work-hardening? Explain briefly. (2 pt) (b) What is the final true strain in block A? (3 pt) (c) What is the final true strain in block B?

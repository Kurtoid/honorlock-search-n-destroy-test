In this scenario, a health administrator works in Ambler, Pennsylvania, which was home to a large production plant that processed vermiculite ore mined from Libby, Montana. Ambler, Pennsylvania, is also a Superfund Site because of the Keasbey and Mattison plant. Notice the ponds on the property located near a creek and a flood plain.     The plant dumped solid wastes on the surface acreage, and liquid waste slurries were pumped into constructed cinder block berms and allowed to dry being in the 1930s and continued until 1974. Ambler, Pennsylvania, has many older homes that have not been renovated with plumbing from the early 1930s, insulation from the 1940s, and still have paint from the 1960s and 1970s. Over the past several years, many of the younger area residents with kids are starting to rent or buy these older homes. The health administrator has been working in this community for four years. Recently he has noticed an increasing number of children with learning and behavior problems at his son's daycare.

He thinks back to his public health course in college and asks himself two questions. First based on Ambler's environmental factors, what is the most like cause of the issues with the children?

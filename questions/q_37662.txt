Recent studies regarding long term cell phone usage strongly suggest that brain development for children under 5 years old can be affected by long term exposure to the low level radiation they emit. The same study showed that cognitive function decreased in males exposed to the rays at all ages. The study, published in the Journal Nature, has been widely accepted across the scientific community. The Telecommunications Act authorizes the FCC to "oversee the marketing and labeling requirements for all cellular products sold in the United States." Intense political pressure by telecommunications giants has kept the issue of the agenda of federal government agencies. On January 2, 2008, after learning of the studies, Mothers Against Cell Phones (MACP) filed a legislative rulemaking petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requesting that they require a warning label on cell phone packaging that informs consumers of the risks posed to infants and toddlers. As of January 22, 2012, the FCC had not acted on the petition. A reviewing court hearing a challenge by MACP regarding a FCC denial of the petition will:

The herpesviruses are enveloped DNA viruses that actively infects nervous tissue. The virus can remain in the the host cell in a latent (inactive) phase. The virus can then reactivate, replicate again, and be infectious.   In electron micrographs of herpesvirus infection, it can be seen that the intact virus initially reacts with cell surface receptors. This is later followed by viral capsids docking with nuclear pores. Afterward, the capsids go from being full to being "empty." Which statement best describes these observations?

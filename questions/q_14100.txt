(DCI) manufacturers a line of drones that are distributed to large retailers. The line consists of four models of drones. The following data is available regarding the models:    Model DCI Selling Priceper Unit Variable Cost per Unit Demand/Year (units)   Model D1 $835 $115 1,535   Model D2 $315 $110 2,865   Model D3 $415 $105 3,535   Model D4 $515 $135 3,300      Drone Concepts is considering the addition of a fifth model to its line of drones. This model would be sold to retailers for $625. The variable cost of this unit is $315. The demand for the new Model D5 is estimated to be 2,000 units per year. Forty percent of these unit sales of the new model is expected to come from other models already being manufactured by Drone Concepts (10 percent from Model D1, 30 percent from Model D2, 40 percent from Model D3, and 20 percent from Model D4). Drone Concepts will incur a fixed cost of $550,000 to add the new model to the line. Based on the preceding data, should DCI add the new Model D5 to its line of drones? Why or why not?

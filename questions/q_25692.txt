Visitamos, vimos, conocimos, conversamos, paseamos, tomamos cientos de fotos, pero sobre todo1, !!comimos!! !Que comida tan buena! Y lo mas interesante es que, en un pais tan pequeno, varia mucho de region a region. Por eso lo probamos todo.      Comimos ensaladas, sopas, la famosa paella, todo tipo de pescados y mariscos..., y todo preparado de una manera muy simple, con ajo, perejil2 y aceite de oliva3. Por eso todo tenia un sabor muy natural y autentico. El aceite de oliva fue lo mas nuevo e interesante. Los espanoles lo usan para todo.      ?Y de postre? Los dulces son muy variados, muy ricos y no tan "dulces"; por eso, no tienes que preocuparte... comi mucho, si, pero llevo la misma ropa de siempre, la que a ti te gusta.      ?Y las tapas? !Que buena idea! Son pequenisimos platos preparados con una gran variedad de ingredientes. Comer tapas es una excelente oportunidad para conocer gente y conversar. Este verano vamos tu y yo. A ti tambien te va a encantar.

Use the following information to answer the question."The native structure of hemoglobin (Hb) comprises of two a and two b subunits, each of which carries a heme group. There appear to be no previous studies that report the in-vitro folding and assembly of Hb from highly unfolded a and b globin in a 'one-pot' reaction. One difficulty that has to be overcome for studies of this kind is the tendency of Hb to aggregate during refolding. This work demonstrates that denaturation of Hb in 40% acetonitrile at pH 10.0 is reversible." (J Am Soc Mass Spectrum 2007, 18, 8-16)Hemoglobin is ________.

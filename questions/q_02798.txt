The use of arsenate instead of phosphate by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase produces 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate. Assume that the presence of arsenate only affects the glycolysis step catalyzed by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and that 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate spontaneously hydrolyzes to form 3-phosphoglycerate. How many ATP molecules would a single round of glycolysis consume and produce in this scenario?
[20 Points]: Imagine you are buying a new running shoe. You care about 3 criteria: Style, Comfort, and Price. You have narrowed down your search to three alternatives: Nike, Addidas, and Asics. Here are your pairwise comparisons for each criterion. (AKA which criterion do you care about the most.)     A) Solve for the weight matrix (w) for the criterion.  B)  If Nike option is $50, Adidas option is $40, and Asics Option is $55, solve for the score vector (S) for the price of the shoes, with a lower-priced shoe being the more desirable option.  C) The weight matrix (S) for Style and Comfort are given. Using the score matrix and weight vector, solve for the global score vector (v), rank the options (with 1 being the best choice and 3 being the worst choice), and determine which shoe you should choose.      (S)   Aesthetics   Performance   Price      Nike   0.30   0.34         Adidas   0.34   0.23         Asics   0.36   0.44

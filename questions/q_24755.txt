Description  Randomized Clinical Trial, Cohort Study and Case Control    Instructions  The purpose of this study is to determine if child-bearing age women who did not give birth to at least one child are at higher risk of developing breast cancer than women who had given birth to at least one child. Interviews were conducted with all women of child-bearing age in several hospital systems in Atlanta. Based on the interviews  the women were classified into 2 groups: those who gave birth to at least one child and those who did not give birth to any children. Employee health records, medical records and insurance claims were collected over the next 10 years and women were re-examined to determine occurrences of breast cancer diagnosis. At the conclusion of this study, breast cancer rates were calculated and the groups with children and without children were compared on their breast cancer rates over 10 years. Findings indicate that 100,000 women were enrolled in the study and 12,000 of those enrolled had no children and 88,000 had children. After 10 years, there were 400 diagnosis of breast cancer among women with children and 800 breast cancer diagnosis among women without children.

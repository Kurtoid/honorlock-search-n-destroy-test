Three point charges are fixed in space on the coordinate system shown below. The coordinate axes are marked in meters.      a) Find the electric field at point P, located at the origin. b) Calculate the electric field at a point P' at position r= 11 mi + 8 mj [ r=(11 m, 8 m)]. c) Find the force on an additional charge of qo=-6.4x10-6 C placed at the origin. d) What is the force on a charge of 4.9x10-2 C if it is placed at point P'? part a)  Now calculate the magnitudes of each of the contributions to the electric field at point P.    = 1.636   x  105 N/C    = 1.001   x  105 N/C    = 9.250   x  105 N/C E2x= -4.477 x104 N/C E2y=  8.955 x104 N/C EP =   1.188 x105 N/C i + 1.014x106 N/C j = (1.188 x105 N/C , 1.014x106 N/C) part b)    =3.094 x  105 N/C    =3.56 x  104 N/C   =1.05 x  105 N/C You must break up E3 into components and determine the signs in order to finish this problem to get the net electric field.

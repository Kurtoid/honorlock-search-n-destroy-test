You setup an experiment by first dividing two TSA plates into four sectors labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The organism that you streak onto Sector 1 of both plates is the same; the organism on Sector 2 of both plates is the same; the same is true for Sector 3 and Sector 4.  You place one of each plate in the 37C incubator for 24 hours.  You place the duplicate plates in a GasPak Chamber and then in the incubator at 37C for 24 hours.

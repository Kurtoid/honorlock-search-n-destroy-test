How much energy is required to heat 87.1 g acetone (molar mass = 58.08 g/mol) from a solid at -154.0 degC to a liquid at -42.0 degC?  The following physical data may be useful. DHfus,acetone = 7.27 kJ/mol           Cliquid,actone = 2.16 J/gdegC.           Cgas,acetone = 1.29 J/gdegC            Csolid,acetone = 1.65 J/gdegC Tmelting,acetone = -95.0 degC
Your manager gave you an objective for your next meeting with a prospect: "Sell something soon!"  Using the SMART concept for setting sales meeting objectives, what is the most accurate evaluation of this objective?
Serial ten-fold dilutions are made from a broth culture of Bacillus subtilis in order to determine the number of bacteria in the culture.  Following the dilution series, 0.1 ml of a 1:10,000 (1 x 10-4) dilution is plated, the plate is incubated, and 110 colonies are counted.  Calculate the number of bacteria in the original Bacillus subtilis culture. Don't forget units! Make sure your answer reflects proper scientific notation! Use the ^ to denote an exponent, i.e. 1 x 10-4 would be written as 1 x 10^-4. Note: Don't forget the units. No points without units!

Use Kirchoff's Rules to analyze the circuit below.  V1 = 9 V V2 = 12 V R3 = 50 O R4 = 100 O       Redraw the circuit, and as you answer the rest of this question, add arrows showing any loops that you use in your analysis. [1] Label both ends of each battery and each resistor in your drawing for part A with  "+" or "-" to indicate which side is at a higher Voltage. For the batteries, your labels should be correct.

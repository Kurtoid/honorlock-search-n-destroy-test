Shaina (age 23) becomes extremely anxious and distressed if made to go to certain places like the grocery store or a movie theater, or to ride on buses or trains. In particular, she does not like being in small, enclosed, and crowded spaces.

Instead, she will agree to go as long as her husband accompanies her, though she continues to feel anxious. Shaina knows that her fear is unreasonable, but she is concerned that if she is by herself in any of these places that she might do something embarrassing like falling or becoming incontinent, and that she won't be able to escape or get help. These things have never happened, but she continues to be afraid and distressed. Her symptoms have been occurring for the past 5 years. What disorder does Shaina have?

On December 2, 2014, Major League Baseball player Torii Hunter signed a one-year contract to play for the Minnesota Twins in 2015. In 2014, he played for the Detroit (Michigan) Tigers, earning $14 million. Assume the following:  Hunter's marginal federal tax rate is 39.6%. Minnesota will tax Hunter's income at 9.85%. Michigan taxed Hunter's income at 4.25%. The city of Detroit taxed Hunter's income at 2.4%. State and local taxes are not deductible for federal purposes. Federal taxes are not deductible for state and local tax purposes. Local income taxes are not deductible for state tax purposes. Hunter lived in Detroit in 2014 and will live in Minneapolis (which has no local income tax) in 2015. For simplicity, assume all income will be taxed in Hunter's place of residence, regardless of where he travels to play baseball games. Team salary comprises Hunter's entire income. Ignore payroll taxes.  a) Calculate Hunter's 2014 after-tax income. (3 points)   b) Calculate how much the Minnesota Twins would have to pay Hunter (before taxes) to keep his after-tax pay the same in 2015 as it was in 2014. (6 points)   c) Now assume that state and city taxes are fully deductible for federal income tax purposes (in 2014 and 2015). Recalculate your answer for (b) given this new fact. (6 points)

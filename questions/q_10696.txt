Quealy dialed 911 to report a family dispute with potential for violence. Police officers arrived at the scene and knocked on the door. They heard a loud disturbance inside. Quealy called 911 again to say that the dispute was over and that the officers could leave. The dispatcher informed the officers at the scene about this call, but the officer shouted through the door that they would need to enter the apartment before they could leave. Quealy placed two more calls to 911, again asking the officers to go away. When she finally cracked open the door, the officers pushed it open and came into the apartment. Quealy began screaming and flailing, several feet away from the officers. The officers saw nobody else in the apartment, but decided to detain Quealy long enough to check out the rest of the apartment. When they tried to restrain her, she began to resist, fell to the floor, and began to kick at one of the officers. After a struggle, two officers managed to handcuff her, seat her on a stairway outside the apartment. After securing the handcuffs to the stairway railing, and calling for a backup unit, one of the officers asked her, "Why did you keep calling 911?" She answered, "I should have stopped." Quealy is charged with misuse of 911 and interfering with an officer. Can the government introduce Quealy's statement at trial?

We would like to choose the best regression model that predicts violent crime in the U.S.  Models 1, 2, and 3 are shown in the data description file. Use the SAS output provided (below and the ones in the data description) to answer the question.  Mode 2: Crime = b0 + b1 murder + b2 single + b3 pctmetro + e  Choose the option that best answers the question. I. Model 2 should be used because it is in accordance with all classical assumptions (linearity, endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, and normality of the errors). II. Model 2 should be used because it has higher Adj-R2, lower Se (when compared to model 1), and all variables are statistically significant at a 5% level.  III. Model 2 should not be used because the variable poverty must be included in the model.  IV.  The dependent variable crime should be transformed to the natural log of crime to fix heteroskedasticity.

A sample of oxygen at room temperature occupies a volume of 500. L at 1.75 atm. What would be the volume of this gas at 2.50 atm at the constant temperature and moles?
Calculate the concentration of H3O+ in a solution that contains  1.9 x 10-9 M  OH-at 25degC.  Identify the solution as acidic, basic, or neutral. (Kw at this temperature is 1.00 x 10-14)
An advantage for an individual of having employment-based insurance is that it:
Assume that a class called ACunit has been declared with an attribute called status (a boolean) that stores whether the ACunit is off (false) or on (true). The class also has an attribute called hours (an integer). The class has getters and setters for both attributes and a default constructor that initializes both attributes. Furthermore, the class has the following method: public void increaseHours(int amount) {    hours = hours + amount;}   Assume that the main method of the driver contains the code that declares and creates an ACunit class variable called lobbyAC. Write code for the main method that checks whether the lobbyAC is on or off. If it is on, then your code should turn it off, and increase its hours by 5.
The introduction of a large predatory fish species into a lake will lead to declines in populations of smaller fish, which in turn cause an increase in plankton. This series of events is one example of:

Use the supplied genetic dictionary table above. A mRNA sequence is shown below.  The blue arrow indicates a nucleotide mutation within a codon.  Given the mRNA sequence, indicate what the original Amino Acid would be and then what Amino Acid would result from the mutation.  Enter your answer as :  Val or Phe or whichever Amino Acid is correct.  If the mutation results in a Stop Codon, answer with TERM.    Original Amino Acid = [AA1] Replacement Amino Acid = [AA2]

Approximately two months ago, two-year old Harry was infected with an enterovirus and had severe respiratory symptoms for about a week before recovering. Earlier this week, he fell ill again, but this time his signs and symptoms indicate infection with a parvovirus.  To confirm a parvovirus infection, Harry's physician orders an antibody titer.  Which of the following results would you expect?
In the term oliguria, the prefix olig- means:

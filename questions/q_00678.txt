ISIQEPHU B: UKUFINGQA UMBUZO 2  Fundisisa lesi siqeshana esingezansi bese usifingqa ngamaphuzu ayi-7, ubhale izindlela induku eyakha/eqondisa ngayo umntwana.     IMIYALELO: 1.    Bhala ngemisho ephelele, amaphuzu angu-50 kuya-60. 2.    Imisho yakho mayibe nezinombolo kusukela kweyoku-1 kuya kweye-7. 3.    Bhala iphuzu elilodwa emshweni ngamunye. 4.    Ekugcineni kwamaphuzu wonke owabhalile, bhala inani lamagama owasebenzisile.             TEXT B         INDUKU IYAMQONDISA UMNTWANA     1   Indlela ibuzwa kwabaphambili. Induku iyamqondisa umntwana iphinde imfake endleleni. Ngivuma ukuthi seliyasibhubhela manje. Uhulumeni usasitshela ukuthi izingane zethu sizikhulise kanjani. Thina sikhule konke kungekho lokhu. Umzali waka makhelwane ubumthathisa okomzali wakho uqobo ayi lento esiyenzeka manje.     2    Izingane ziphethe abantu abadala. Umuntu omdala akasaziwa, angiyibalike inhlonipho ayisekho qobo. Ngike ngihlale ngibukisise impilo yesimanje ngizwe ngishaywa isibhobo ngendlela abantwana benza ngakhona. Izibusiso abazazi nanokuthi ziqoqwa kanjani. Ekuziphatheni kwabo bathanda izindlela ezisheshayo empilweni. Bathanda ubumnandi besikhashana. Bathanda ukufa kunokuphila sizothini ke thina singobani ngoba phela kuthiwa asifundile asikho ezintweni.     3   Esikoleni ke thina sikhule umhlonipha uthisha. Sikhule umesaba uthisha. Sikhule sishaywa ngempela uma ufika ekhaya uthi uyomceba uthisha ukuthi ukushayile, wawushayelwa kona ukuthi wena awuyile ukuyofunda esikoleni uyoshaywa othisha. Sikhule kuthiwa uma ushaywa esikoleni wehlisa isithunzi sakini, udicilelela phansi isibongo sakini - ke zikhathi zonke sasikubalekela ukushaywa.     4   Nginothisha engimkhumulela isigqoko Kwaku Mnu Cele. UMnu Cele wayengifundisa izibalo(Maths) Kanye nesingisi (English) uMnu Cele wayekushaya kuphele inyanga yonke isandla singabhali noma singakwazi ukusebenza ngendlela ejwayelekile kanti futhi abazali babemuthanda kakhulu. UMnu Cele wayethi uma ehamba kovelande besikole akekho owayetshela omunye ukuthi akubalekwe kungenwe emagumbini okufundela uvule incwadi uthule uthi nya.     5   Wayehlala ngase khaya uma ehlangana nawe isikole sesiphumile isikole kodwa wena usahamba nomfaniswano wesikole wayekufaka emotweni yakhe i(Tazz) uyokushaya esikoleni kuqala bese ekuyisa ekhaya lakho lapho abazali ababe besabuza nokuthi kwenzakaleni sebeyozifundela kwezabo. Ngiyambonga kakhulu uMnu Cele ngendlela ebesifaka ngayo endleleni ngoba uma uphume esandleni sakhe umehluko uyabonakala.     6   Ngiyadabuka uma ngibuka intsha yesimanje engazi lutho ngenduku. Eyazi ukuthi yona namalungelo kodwa ilibale ukuwasebenzisa ngendlela. Ngidabuka ekujuleni kwenhliziyo uma ngibona izingane zesikole zidla izidakamizwa zigqoke imifaniswano yesikole. Kuvele kuthi angihlanye uma seziphendulana nothisha ziba kuhlaza kothisha ubone kahle ukuthi ayiboni uthisha izibonela untanga nje la. Ngimile ekuthinini induku iyamqondisa umntwana.

On your own paper, redraw this circuit, clearly label the appropriate number of different, unknown currents and their directions. Once you have drawn the circuit, you are to create the set of Kirchhoff equations you would use to solve for all unknown variables. You need to make the decision about how many equations are needed. You SHOULD NOT spend the time actually solving for these values, you just need to create the equations. For clarity, the 55 mA current is known to be moving downward through the 60 ohm resistor and the the 82 mA current is known to be moving upward through the unknown emf and the 80 ohm resistor.

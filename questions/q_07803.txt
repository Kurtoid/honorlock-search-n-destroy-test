The company lets you decide your own guaranteed minimum time per month and offers $0.14 per minute of your guaranteed minimum time and $0.45 per minute if your usage exceeds the guaranteed minimum time. For example, if you pick 500 minutes per month as your guaranteed minimum time, then you pay $500*0.14 = $70 fixed monthly fee and $0.45 per minute over 500 minutes. The actual usage (in minutes) per month is distributed following the table below:     actual usage (minutes) probability cdf   360 7/25 7/25   370 4/25 11/25   400 2/25 13/25   440 1/25 14/25   470 5/25 19/25   480 3/25 22/25   500 3/25 25/25                      Suppose that you pick 400 minutes as your guaranteed minimum time.  (a) If the actual usage for a month is 360 minutes, what is the cost for the month in dollars? Show work on your scratch paper.  [a] (b) If the actual usage for a month is 500 minutes, what is the cost for the month in dollars? Show work on your scratch paper.

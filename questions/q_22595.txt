Young and Old Brains: Who Wins?   1     Our knowledge about the human brain is expanding rapidly, and developments in technology are allowing scientists to unravel many of the mysteries of how the mind operates. Some of their findings are fascinating. They are also surprising because many of the beliefs that we have entertained for years are being challenged. 2     One of these beliefs is about the aging of the brain. For many years, scientists believed that the brain kept growing while we were young but that after age twenty-five a steady period of decline set in as we aged. But recent research has shown that this perception is not necessarily accurate. While there are some important differences between older and younger brains, younger people do not perform better in many cognitive tasks. In many ways, our brains improve as we age. 3     It is true that younger people learn fast and memorize easily. Children and teenagers learn languages quickly and readily absorb new information. They tend to have better short-term memories and can usually concentrate for longer on tasks that require extended focus. They usually have quicker reflexes, so they can react quickly in a traffic emergency, for example. However, they can be quite inefficient thinkers in other ways. Their brains are not so good at doing several things simultaneously, or at juggling various small pieces of information. This is because the frontal lobe, which is the part of the brain that performs this kind of thinking, does not develop fully until the early twenties. For the same reason, multitasking doesn't come easily to teens. This may be part of the reason that sixteen-years-olds may be able to drive well but may find it difficult to drive well, maintain a conversation, and listen to music at the same time. 4     Older brains, on the other hand, have built up a lot of experience, so they can handle information that comes from different sources at the same time and cope with demands from different sides. They can switch between tasks more easily. They are better at synthesizing information quickly, analyzing complex situations, and coming up with solutions. Older people can also judge other people more accurately and make good judgments about financial decisions. Experience counts, and the experience that older people acquire helps their brains to function more efficiently. 5     The reason that these findings have come to light is that studies that began in the 1950s are being published now. These studies look at one group of people over time and study how they change. The results are eye-opening. For example, in a recent study, 6,000 participants were tracked for forty years. The researchers found that the people in the study, who are now in their forties, fifties, and sixties, performed consistently better on tests of logic, vocabulary, verbal memory, and spatial orientation than they had done in their twenties (Strauch, 2010). 6     Scientists believe that what causes this increased ability is a substance called myelin, which is a fatty deposit that coats the white matter in the brain. Myelin builds up over time and acts like insulation, increasing the conductivity of brain cells. This helps the white matter to build more and faster connections between the different parts of the brain. The more connections, the faster a brain can process, and the more shortcuts it can take. It is myelin that allows us to size up a situation quickly and to reject various options in favor of a reasoned response. Adult experience and wisdom are actually reflected in the physical brain, which has been building up pathways and connections over time. 7     Of course, there are some drawbacks to having an older brain. Older people tend to get distracted more easily and find it harder to handle new and difficult problems. They have more short-term memory problems, such as forgetting names or where they put their keys! When this happens, we often worry about this absent-mindedness, fearing that it is a precursor of old age. But scientists reassure us that these shortcomings are relatively unimportant. It's the big picture that counts. And that's good news for all of us--young and old.  References:  Strauch, B. (2010). The secret life of the grown-up brain. New York, NY: Viking.

A woman entered into an enforceable contract to sell her small apartment building to an investor for $500,000. The agreement provided that escrow would close on August 31, and on that date the woman would provide good and marketable title to the apartment building, free and clear of all encumbrances. The insurance company notified the woman that her insurance policy on the building would lapse on August 29 if she did not renew by August 1. Because of the sale, the woman decided not to renew. On August 30, the uninsured building was destroyed by a hurricane. On August 31, the investor refused to close, and the woman immediately brought an action against him for specific performance. In this jurisdiction, which has no applicable statute to govern this situation, which party is most likely to prevail?

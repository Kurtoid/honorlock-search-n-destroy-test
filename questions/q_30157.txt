What is the first step of principled negotiation?
Which alternative will increase the probability of detecting a shift in the process average?
The picture below shows the result of a study that used indirect calorimetry to determine metabolic rate in the nurse shark.  The y-axis shows oxygen consumption, whereas the x-axis shows swimming speed (U) in body lengths per second. The black markers show the results of measurements made at 23C and the gray markers show the results of measurements made at 30C. Briefly explain what indirect calorimetry is and how it is useful for measuring metabolic rate. Then, briefly explain what the results of this graph tell us about SMR in the nurse shark in relation to temperature and swimming speed (make sure to explain the unusual nature of the relationship shown by the black markers and why these relationships occur).

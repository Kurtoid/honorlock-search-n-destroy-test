True/False.  Enter T or F for statement.  (Do not enter the words "true" or "false".  Just the capital letter T or F) [1] Contributions in electrical engineering have made activities of daily life more comfortable, convenient, and connected. [2] Heating a semiconductor will increase the electron mobility. [3] Electrolytic capacitors are generally used for their very large capacitance values. [4] An electric charge sitting still (stationary) will accelerate when a magnetic field is applied. [5] Faraday's Law is useful for calculating the voltage induced in a coil by a time-varying magnetic field. [6] A time-varying current through a wire creates a static magnetic field. [7] Gauss' Law for Magnetics implies that there can be no magnetic monopoles (point sources of magnetic field). [8] Transformers are essential for achieving high power efficiency in large scale power systems. [9] The electrical phases of a three-phase generator are associated with three different coils (winding sets) positioned 120 degrees relative to each other inside the machine. [10] Load balancing is complicated for solar and wind farms due to intermittency issues.
Cultural anthropologists like to hang out with the people they are studying as they work, celebrate, dance, or play games, and ask lots of questions while they are doing it. This is known as:

A psychologist examining the effects of text messaging on driver error found statistically significant results for a hypothesis tested with an independent-samples t test. The author of the study reported their effect size for the test as r2 = 0.20. According to Cohen's convention, this effect size is considered:

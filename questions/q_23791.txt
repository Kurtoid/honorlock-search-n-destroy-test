Please use the Heparin Protocol to answer the questions. WEIGHT ADJUSTED HEPARIN PROTOCOLLab Orders:  STAT: PT, INR, PTT, CBC  STAT: PTT 6 hours after any Heparin BOLUS or rate adjustment.  PTT every 6 hours until two (2) consecutive PTTs are therapeutic (46 to 70). Then change PTT to every 24 hours.  Stop Heparin infusion if platelet count is less than 100,000 or platelet count drops by 50% pre-Heparin level, and notify healthcare provider.   STEPS IN CALCULATING HEPARIN DOSAGE (INITIAL DOSAGE)  Change weight in pounds to kilograms.  Calculate IV Bolus Heparin at 80 units/kg (80 units per kg).   On hand: Heparin 5000 units/1 ml   Calculate IV Heparin continuous infusion at 18 units/kg/hr (18 units per kg per hr).   On hand: Heparin continuous infusion 25,000 units in 250 ml D5W.  Adjust Heparin infusion rate based on the sliding scale below (after the initial dosing and based upon subsequent PTTs):       PTT   UNITS OF HEPARIN      90    STOP Heparin for 1 hour, Then reduce Heparin infusion by 3 units/kg/hr.      The healthcare provider writes an order to initiate the weight based Heparin protocol. You are starting an infusion of heparin on a {x} pound patient. The initial infusion rate will be _____________ ml/hr. Record your answer using 1 decimal place(s). Enter only a number in the blank.
A patient is being treated with carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet) for Parkinson's disease. Which assessment finding should indicate to the nurse that a change in the medication or dosage may be needed?
In this image, what affect did ATP have on the ATP-sensitive K+ channel?   ATP closed the channel  In step C, we can see that a depolarization activates/opens the voltage-dependent Ca++ channel.  In order for a depolarization to occur, K+ channels in the previous step (step B) would need to close.  This would prevent K+ from leaking out of the cell, which would result in an accumulation of positively charged ions inside the cell--depolarizing it.  If K+ channels were opened, this would lead to more K+ leaving the cell, which would hyperpolarize the cell...similar to what is seen in the after-hyperpolarization phase of an action potential.
The cost of land would not include:
DQ4:   The nurse needs to record the patient's I&Os at the end of the 8 hour shift.  The patient's intake/output is as follows:  Three bottles of  water 16 oz each Suction content 10 oz 1 cup of coffee    Urine 1250 mL      a) How many mL should be recorded in the Intake flow sheet? ____________ mL [Intake] b) How many mL should be recorded in the Output flow sheet? _______mL [Output]

Despite lysozyme being a rather small protein (14kDa), it exhibits a more complicated folding pathway than other small proteins. Briefly, describe the pathway for lysozyme folding, citing enzymes that might have a role in folding of this or other proteins.  A variant of lysozyme, generated from a lysozyme gene with a single nucleotide substitution leading to incorporation of a different amino acid into the protein, has been observed to form an amyloid or protein aggregate. Provide an explanation for this observation, as well as address the following query: when looking at the crystal structures for monomers of the normal and variant lysozyme, would you expect to see discernible differences, and if so what differences would there be?

Lecture Test 3, Extra Credit Question #1  Suppose you are an ecologist study competition in 4 species of grasshopper mice that inhabit your study plot.  After exhaustive study, you have documented the following:                  All species eat exactly the same food: field crickets that are 12 mm long.                  All 4 species are uniformly dispersed in the plot.                  All species feed in the exact same locations.                  All species are resident and hibernate at the exact same time.                  None of the species collects and hordes food.  They all eat food immediately at the source. Your research indicates that competition for food is negligible and you suspect resource partitioning.  How could these species be partitioning when they overlap so extensively?

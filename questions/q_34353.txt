A police officer was investigating the burglary of a home. The homeowner stated that only some cash, his expensive watch, and his handgun had been stolen from the home. The police had received a tip that a man who lived in an abandoned car in a nearby forest preserve had been showing people a gun he "had found" and that he also seemed to have come into some money. The officer immediately drove to the forest preserve and went up to the car, which he observed was up on blocks and had no wheels. The car contained clothes and other items that seemed to indicate that someone lived in it. The only occupant was a woman sleeping in the passenger's seat. The officer knocked on the car window, announced that he was a police officer, and asked to talk to the man who lived in the car. The woman, who did not live in the car, told the officer that the man would not be back for some time. The officer, believing that the woman lived in the car, told her that he suspected that the man had burglarized a home and stolen some small items. He asked her if he could look in the car. The woman shrugged and said, "Sure, why not?" and let the officer in. After seeing nothing in the front seat of the car, the officer looked in the back seat. He moved some clothes around and then opened a paper bag that had been beneath the clothes. In the bag, he found the handgun. Shortly thereafter, the man returned and was arrested and charged with burglary and other relevant crimes. On a motion by the man's attorney to suppress the introduction of the handgun into evidence, how is the court likely to rule?

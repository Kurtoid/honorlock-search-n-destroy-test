Sika deer were once widely distributed throughout Hokkaido Island, Japan, but declined in the 1900s because of habitat destruction and overexploitation by humans.  Due to removal of the main predator (wolves) combined with protection from hunting, the population recovered and spatial distribution throughout the island increased. Between 1986 - 2002, a study was done to observe the colonization of the sika deer population in Shiretoko National Park. At the beginning of the study, the ecologists found the deer feeding primarily on the leaves and bark of 13 browse species (small accessible trees such as dwarf bamboo that are less than 2m in height). As the population continued to grow, the number of small tree species decreased to 9 in 1988, to 5 in 1995, and to 3 in 1999.  By 1999 the majority of the trees left were tall trees (>2m). The winters of 1988 and 1995 were marked by very heavy snow; however, the number of dead deer were 4 and 0, respectively.  In comparison, though the snow fall in the winter of 1999 was comparable, the number of carcasses found were 106, with at least 57% being calves (baby deer).      [Kaji, et. al.  (2004).

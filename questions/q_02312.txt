She currently travels almost year round to play in elite U17 tournaments, is actively being recruited by the best soccer programs in the country, and is a part of U.S. soccer's developmental program. Recently she was even called up for an international friendly for the U17 U.S. Women's National Team. When you are meeting with Elisa, she makes a comment one day: "I want so desperately to make the U.S. national team, and I know I have to prove I am the best in my position at every tournament. I hate losing, and I hate failing so much that at times I allow myself to become consumed with trying not to fail. When I do fail, I blame myself. It's starting to happen so frequently at tournaments I'm beginning to think this is as far as I will go and I've reached the max of my abilities. Fortunately, I'm doing great in school so at least I am still on track to go to a good college and eventually become a doctor."

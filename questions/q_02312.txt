Jake moved into a basement unit (under the landlord) [2 units in house in total].  The landlord agreed to let Jake move in on the condition that he was alone and wouldn't be any trouble.  Jake agreed and got a sweetheart rent of $400 per month all inclusive.  2 months after moving in Jake met the love of his life.  A whirlwind romance and 5 weeks later Lara moved into.  Jake's landlord was understanding about the romance--it happens he said.  However, the rent was $400 for one person all inclusive.  2 people at $400 a month is absurdly low.  Jake agreed and they shook hands at $650 a month and firmed it up with a text message exchange with the landlord.  The new rent was still very affordable given the dual income and this would let them save for a better future.  Life is blissful until Jake comes home 5 months later and finds Lara in a compromising position with the landlord.  Jake gets the bad news that Lara is moving upstairs and to add insult to injury is told that he should probably think about moving out himself.  Jake is angry but bides his time and resumes paying rent at $400 per month for 3 months (short $750 total over 3 months).   The landlord and Lara decide it's time to force the issue knowing that Jake can't afford $650 a month and he certainly can't come up with the arrears.  They serve an N4, file an L1, and get ready for a hearing.  Jake hires you and you go to the hearing.  What outcome did you achieve?

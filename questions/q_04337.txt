Problem 3 We have focused on the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply framework for thinking about short-term changes in the macroeconomy. The news extract in this box appears in The New York Times Post in April. Let's analyze it!    Assume that, initially, the economy was in long-run equilibrium, that is, YE (equilibrium real GDP) was equal to YP (potential Real GDP). a) What are the main components of Aggregate Demand? b) If Congress approves the plan described in the extract, what will be the overall effects of on each of the following: Transfer payments (TR), Government purchases of goods and services (G), taxes (T)? What is the impact on disposable income at the current level of real GDP? (No numbers needed. Just explain if they fall, rise or stay the same and state any additional assumptions you may make) How would this situation affect equilibrium real GDP and price level? Please refer to one of the graphs (1-6) shown above to illustrate the change (if any) in the macroeconomy and discuss the change (if any). Would that benefit or harm the economy? d) Suppose that opponents to the plan who fear an increase in government deficit suggested that, instead of reducing taxes, the Senate should actually increase taxes by the amount the exact amount of the overall increase in government spending. Using the appropriate multipliers, explain whether this balanced approach would increase, reduce, or leave unchanged the nation's real GDP.

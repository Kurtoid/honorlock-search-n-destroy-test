Elements with [1] first ionization energies and  [2] electron affinities generally form cations.
In myelinated neurons, action potentials most commonly occur at the
Complete the following with reference to the systemic circuit. Oxygen moves from blood plasma to interstitial fluid.  This causes  in the blood to [change1].  Hb in RBCs responds to this change by binding to [sub1] and releasing [sub2].  This triggers the enzyme carbonic anhydrase to convert CO2 and water into bicarbonate ions and H+.  This allows bicarbonate ions to flow from the RBC to the plasma in exchange for [mech].  Roughly [pct1]% of carbon dioxide entering the blood will be converted to bicarbonate, while roughly [pct2]% of oxygen leaving the blood was transported bound to Hb.

In the Summary of module 4 the students have to mark as done the module DNA, Genetics, and Evolution-2. as part of the learning activities.    One of the activity there was Epigenetics and the Influence of Our Genes      In summary, all of our traits and characteristics (our phenotype) are the result of an interaction between our genome (all of the genes we inherit) and environmental factors. Some environmental factors (including our diet, our behaviors, and a myriad of environmental exposures) influence our phenotype through non-genetic mechanisms. For example, one might have a number of genes that predispose an individual to being lean; however, such an individual might still become overweight or obese despite their "lean genes" as a result of chronically overeating. Yet other epigenetic factors from the environment can modify the genome in subtle ways without actually changing the code.   To be done here:  Answer the following questions, providing also  some examples and explanations?     What are some  examples of epigenetics in humans?   What is the epigenetic theory? Give some (more than 2) examples?   What are some epigenetic traits that can be inherited ?   Is the epigenetic system of a person heritable? Support and explain.    What is the purpose of epigenetics?

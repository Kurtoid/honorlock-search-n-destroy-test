A [m]-kg block on a horizontal frictionless surface is attached to an ideal massless spring whose spring constant is [k] N/m. The block is pulled from its equilibrium position at x = 0.00 m to a displacement x = +[A] m and is released from rest. The block then executes simple harmonic motion along the horizontal x-axis. When the displacement is x= [x] m, what is the kinetic energy of the block?

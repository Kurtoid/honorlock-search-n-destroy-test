Tableau Task 4        (max 10 pts)   Create a new worksheet in your Tableau workbook.  Name it "Filled Map".   Management wants a map that shows graphically shows which states make the biggest contribution to corporate revenue.  An unskilled user should be able to change the map to display either all of our restaurants or to filter for a single chain.   Create a filled map visualization as follows:  States where we have zero restaurants should not be filled. States where we have at least one restaurant should be completely filled. The color of the fill should be controlled by total sales.  To better convey the idea of "money" please setup the map to use shades of green.  Higher total sales = darker green.  Lower total sales = lighter green. Setup a filter based on the restaurant chain name.  Setup the Viz so that the filter is displayed at the top-right corner of the screen.  That way, an unskilled user can quickly change the filter to display a different chain (or all of the chains) by just clicking a checkbox. Configure the Tooltip to display the following data items:  State, Total Customer Visits, Total Sales.    NOTES:   This task will be graded manually, based on our evaluation of the TWBX file you submit.
Daddy BY SYLVIA PLATH (Links to an external site.) You do not do, you do not do    Any more, black shoe In which I have lived like a foot    For thirty years, poor and white,    Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.   Daddy, I have had to kill you.    You died before I had time---- Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,    Ghastly statue with one gray toe    Big as a Frisco seal   And a head in the freakish Atlantic    Where it pours bean green over blue    In the waters off beautiful Nauset.    I used to pray to recover you. Ach, du.   In the German tongue, in the Polish town    Scraped flat by the roller Of wars, wars, wars. But the name of the town is common.    My Polack friend   Says there are a dozen or two.    So I never could tell where you    Put your foot, your root, I never could talk to you. The tongue stuck in my jaw.   It stuck in a barb wire snare.    Ich, ich, ich, ich, I could hardly speak. I thought every German was you.    And the language obscene   An engine, an engine Chuffing me off like a Jew. A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.    I began to talk like a Jew. I think I may well be a Jew.   The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna    Are not very pure or true. With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck    And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack I may be a bit of a Jew.   I have always been scared of you, With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.    And your neat mustache And your Aryan eye, bright blue. Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You----   Not God but a swastika So black no sky could squeak through.    Every woman adores a Fascist,    The boot in the face, the brute    Brute heart of a brute like you.   You stand at the blackboard, daddy,    In the picture I have of you, A cleft in your chin instead of your foot    But no less a devil for that, no not    Any less the black man who   Bit my pretty red heart in two. I was ten when they buried you.    At twenty I tried to die And get back, back, back to you. I thought even the bones would do.   But they pulled me out of the sack,    And they stuck me together with glue.    And then I knew what to do. I made a model of you, A man in black with a Meinkampf look   And a love of the rack and the screw.    And I said I do, I do. So daddy, I'm finally through. The black telephone's off at the root,    The voices just can't worm through.   If I've killed one man, I've killed two---- The vampire who said he was you    And drank my blood for a year, Seven years, if you want to know. Daddy, you can lie back now.   There's a stake in your fat black heart    And the villagers never liked you. They are dancing and stamping on you.    They always knew it was you. Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through. 21.

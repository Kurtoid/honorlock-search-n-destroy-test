What is the market value of the following mortgage loan: original terms were a loan of $317,000 with monthly payments for 30 years at 5.75%.

My mother is retired and has no source of income other than Social Security.  She owns her home outright, and I have suggested that she consider a reverse annuity mortgage (RAM) to supplement her monthly income.  Suppose her home is currently worth $650,000 (which it is not, by the way).  The bank offers her a RAM with a 50% loan-to-value ratio compounded monthly over 10 years at an interest rate of 4.75%.  By how much can she supplement her monthly income?      (12 pts.)  A lender makes a 70% LTV convertible mortgage loan at a below-market rate of 5.5% on a property selling for $14,500,000.  The term of the loan is 20 years; however, the lender has a conversion option at the end of the 5th year.  At the end of the 5th year, the lender can convert their debt position into a 50% ownership stake in the property.  If the property appreciates at 3.5% per year over those first five years, should the lender exercise their option?        (12 pts.)  I am shopping for a mortgage to finance a medium apartment complex.  Second Auburn Bank offers me a 60% LTV shared appreciation mortgage (SAM) in the amount of $4,700,000.  This loan charges a below-market rate of 4.75% compounded monthly, as well as a 0.5% origination fee.  The mortgage will be amortized based on a 30-year term, but the balance will be due at the end of 10 years.  In addition to the balance due at that time, I must also pay the lender 50% of any appreciation in the value of the complex.  I expect that the apartment complex will increase in value at an average rate of 2% per year (compounded annually) over the next ten years.  If I take the SAM, and if my expectation about appreciation is correct, what is the effective rate?      (6 pts.)  The following is an excerpt from an amortization table for a price level adjusted mortgage.

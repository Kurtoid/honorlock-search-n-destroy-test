30 points) Apple Inc. produces a variety of personal computer products. High-density disks are produced at a rate of 1,800 per day and are shipped out at a rate of 800 per day. Each disk costs the company 20 cents, and the holding costs are based on an 18 percent annual interest rate. Shortages are not permitted. Each production run of a disk type requires recalibration of the equipment, and the estimated costs of this step is $180.  (a) Find the optimal size of each production run and the time between runs.(14 pts) (b) What fraction of the time is the company producing high-density disks? (7 pts) (c) What is the maximum dollar investment in inventory that the company has in these disks? (9 pts)     (30 points) Dell is to plan workforce and production levels for the six-month period January to June. Forecast demands over the next six months for a particular laptop are 1,280, 640, 900, 1,200, 2,000, and 1,400. Ending inventory in December is expected to be 500 units, and the firm would like to have 600 units on hand at the end of June. No shortage is allowed. There are currently (end of December) 300 workers employed in the plant. One worker produced an average of 0.14653 laptop in one day. That is K factor, K= 0.14653. We assume this to be 20, 24, 18, 26, 22, and 15 for January to June, respectively. There are only three costs to be considered: cost of hiring workers, cost of firing workers, and cost of holding inventory. Define  cH = Cost of hiring one worker = $500, cF = Cost of firing one worker = $1,000, cI  = Cost of holding one unit of inventory for one month = $80. Please write down the complete linear programming formulation.  (You don't need to solve it)     (40 points) A desktop plant is interested in determining work force and production levels for the next 5 months. Forecasted demands for Jan-May. are: 420, 280, 460, 190, 310. Starting inventory at the end of December is 200. The work force at end of Dec was 40. From the historical operation, over a period of 40 days, 38 workers can produce 530 units.  Assume we are given the following # working days per month: 22, 16, 23, 20, 21. Holding Cost (per unit per month): $8.50 Hiring Cost per worker: $800 Firing Cost per worker: $1,250 Payroll Cost: $75/worker/day Shortage Cost: $50 unit short/month Please keep the fractions with two decimal digits. Use integer for workers and product numbers. (a) (5pts) What are the net demand and cumulative net demand for different months? (b) (5pts) What is the value of the K factor (i.e., average number of units produced per worker per day)? (c) (10pts) Please calculate how many workers we need? (d) (20pts) Please develop a constant workforce plan without shortage. Write it down in a table with eight columns (Months, # workdays, Net Demand, Cumulative Net Demand, Production, Cumulative Production, End Inventory). (e) (bonus 10 pts) Please calculate the total cost of this plan.

. A woman's husband died in an operating room and the woman visited a medical malpractice lawyer to determine whether she should sue the doctors and the hospital.  The husband was in his 80s when this happened.  The lawyer said he would look into the potential liability of the hospital and doctors.  Unfortunately, the lawyer became busy with other cases and he did not have time to examine the records the woman had given him.  The lawyer also did not hire an expert to review the medical file.  Instead, he told the woman that given her husband's age, she should probably not sue the hospital or the doctors.  The lawyer said, "your husband enjoyed a good life."  Two years later, after the statute of limitations had run in the medical malpractice case, the woman saw one of the doctors who had operated on her husband and the doctor remarked how he was surprised she had not filed a suit because they had clearly committed malpractice in the care of her husband. If the woman sues the lawyer, is the lawyer likely to be liable in tort to the woman (assuming that she had a case against the doctors and the hospital)?

Kick Scooters Metal frames for kick scooters are manufactured in two steps: Stamping and assembly. Each frame is made up of three pieces: one unit of part A and two units of part B.   The parts are fabricated by a single stamping machine that requires a set up time of 90 minutes switching between two part types. Once the machine is set up, the activity time for parts, regardless of type, is 30 seconds each piece.  Currently, the stamping machine rotates its production between one batch of 120 part A's and 240 part B's. Completed parts move only when the entire batch is produced. At assembly, parts are assembled manually to form the finished products. The three parts and a number of small purchased components are required for each unit of final product. Each product requires 30 minutes of labor time to assemble. There are 12 workers in assembly. There is sufficient demand to sell every scooter the system can make. Which batch size for the stamping machine would minimize inventory while maximize the flow rate for the entire process?

One morning while changing him, Sandy sees that his buttocks seem particularly red and that small, bubbly blisters seem to be forming. When she cleaned him up, he was noticeably in pain from it, even though she tried hard to be gentle on his skin.Being a new mom, she decided to have Jackson's pediatrician look at the rash, and she made an appointment for the next day.

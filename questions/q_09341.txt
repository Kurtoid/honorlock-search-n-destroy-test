Target is a closely held corporation with 100 shares of voting common stock outstanding, which are owned 50 shares by Arlene (basis $200), 30 shares by Bob (basis $400), and 20 shares by Carlos (basis $150).  Target owns the following assets:           Basis   FMV     Nonoperating Assets   $200   $300     Operating Assets   $700   $900     Total   $900   $1,200       Target owes $200 (20-year bond held by Lender basis of $190) and has E&P of $400.  Assume that each share of T is worth $10 and that property exchanged therefore is worth $10.  Unless indicated otherwise (1) each transaction has proper business purpose, (2) there is continuity of Target's business enterprise, (3) the transaction is pursuant to a plan of reorganization and (4) the face amount of the debt is its FMV.  Panther is a publicly held corporation whose stock is traded on the NYSE.  What are the tax consequences to Arlene, Bob, Carlos, Lender, Target and Panther from the following transactions?  Support your answer in each by identifying the code section that supports your conclusion.  Target merges into Panther under state law. Target's shareholders receive pro rata $1,000 FMV of Panther nonvoting, nonparticipating, nonconvertible 8% cumulative preferred stock. Target merges into Panther voting stock and the debt assumption. Bob objects to the merger and dissents under state law procedures. Bob's stock is purchased by Target under an agreement whereby Bob agrees to take the $300 non-operating assets and whereby the stock given by Panther is reduced to $700.

Read the following scenario to answer the following question(s).Biomedical scientists have recently developed an anticancer drug delivery system that sneaks the anticancer drug into cancer cells before releasing it. They were able to do this by using two sets of liposomes. An anticancer drug (Doxorubicin (Dox)) bound to DNA molecules was added into one set of liposomes (type A), and a high concentration of ATP molecules were added to the other set of liposomes (type B). The drug is inactive when bound to DNA molecules. Researchers inject both types of liposomes (A and B) into cancer cells, and upon doing so their contents are released. The ATP molecules (from liposome type A) bind to the DNA molecules (from liposome type B) and activate the drug, thus inducing cell death and decreasing tumor size.Mice with breast cancer tumors were treated with this liposome system to test the effectiveness of the drug. The scientists performed three trials one with both types of liposomes (Dox + ATP), one with just the drug (Dox only), and one with a salt solution (control). Examine the figure below and answer the following questions.What statement regarding this data is TRUE?

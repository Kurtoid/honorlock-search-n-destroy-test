After that the atmospheric concentration will start to decrease and ultimately stabilize due to the natural carbon cycle.   Explain (don't just list) at least 3 processes that will remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Include a statement about whether each process will happen over short (< a century), intermediate (hundreds to tens of thousands of years) or long time scales (a hundred thousand years or longer).

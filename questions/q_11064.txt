Clover moved from Millbrae, CA to Cincinnati, OH.  When she first got there, she often felt out of breath even just walking from her car to the classroom.  However, after living there for 5 years, she could go jogging without feeling the shortness of breath.  One day, Clover went to a new trail for a run and noticed that the same geranium plants in Cincinnati had leaves that have much more red pigmentation than ones that she remembered seeing in Millbrae.  Clover thought to herself, "Aha, these plants must have evolved, just like I had, to adapt to the colder environments in Cincinnati because darker pigments can absorb more heat."  Clover most likely had not taken Evolution in college; otherwise she would have known that she had made a mistake in her statement and she would also know that in order for her conclusions that "the darker color in Cincinnati populations was an adaptation to the colder environments", she needs to make some assumptions or to collect more evidence for support.  1) What is the mistake in Clover's statement?    2) What kind of evidence would you need in order to support Clover's statement on that the difference in the leaf pigmentation found in Millbrae, CA and Cincinnati, OH is the result of adaptation.  In other words, how would you show that darker color leaves are an adaptive trait in Cincinnati, OH?

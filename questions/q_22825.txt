You are an American investor with assets in Great Britain. The data provided below indicates that the local currency price of the asset (P*) and the dollar price of the pound (S) are positively correlated, so that depreciation (appreciation) of the pound against the dollar is associated with a declining (rising) local currency price of the asset.

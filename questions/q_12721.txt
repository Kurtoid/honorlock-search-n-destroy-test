Case study #1: A 45 year old man comes to the clinic complaining about pain and numbness to his right lower extremity. The pain and numbness are located along his posterior thigh, posterior and lateral leg, and the lateral side of his foot.  Because this type of pain could result from nerve compression at different locations along the nerve distribution, the next three questions present three different scenarios. Each scenario gives you additional information gathered by further examination, observation and questioning of the patient. Each scenario presents a patient with different symptoms. The goal is to test your ability to discern differential diagnosis. Scenario # 3: When talking to the patient, you find out that he used to be a long distance runner and that he rarely performed any stretching exercises. You also observe no abnormalities when examining the X-ray images of his vertebral column. Based on this scenario, which of the following is his most likely diagnosis?

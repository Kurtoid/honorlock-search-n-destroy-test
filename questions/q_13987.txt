Suppose U-Mobile covers the service region shown in the figure below. There are 22 cells in the region, numbered 0 - 21. The center cell is A at position 0.  The frequency reuse is N=3 and alpha = 3.  Suppose cell number 12 becomes overloaded with users so that U-Mobile places a micro tower at the center of the cell at position 12. The microcell has the same frequency band as cell A. Calculate the received power, Prmicro(R) from the micro-tower in cell 12 that is experienced at the boundary of cell A.  Assume the frequency of operation is 800MHz, the transmitter and receiver gains are 4dBi and 3dBi, respectively, R =1km, and alpha = 3. The transmission power for the microcell is Pr,micro = 3W.      Answer format: The received power at R from the micro tower is: ____________ dBW

In the attached workbook on the "Exam1-Q6" tab is a spreadsheet to keep track of the infection rate of COVID19 in the U.S. The COVID cases are calculated as the U.S. population multiply by the Infection Rate. Complete the Excel spreadsheet showing the following items: (1) the initial COVID cases on 03/17/2020 (U.S. population multiplied by initial infection rate). (2) the COVID cases on the 1st day of each month (U.S. population multiplied by corresponding infection rate in each month).  (3) the % change in infection rate (change in infection rate as a percentage of the previous day's infection rate). Note: you can use the infection rate of 03/17/2020 to calculate the % change for 04/01/2020. (4) the % change in overall COVID cases (change in COVID cases as a percentage of the initial case on 03/17/2020). Due to the widespread of COVID19, you may get a % change larger than 100%. The formulas should be written such that the values highlighted in blue change automatically (and correctly) if the values highlighted in yellow are changed. Note: this is an Excel spreadsheet problem and no programming is required. Once complete, please type a one-word essay (e.g., "ok") for this question and then upload your combined Excel file at the very end of this exam.

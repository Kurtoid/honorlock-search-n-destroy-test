The Orphan Hermit flew (wearing a mask!) to Beijing, China, a few weeks ago to visit one of his old CHM 2051 classmates, who had returned to China to serve as CEO of a new startup company building innovative cell phones.  Although Orphy didn't encounter many other hermits in Beijing, he did run into a few hermits hiking along the Great Wall. Orphy flew to Beijing in one of United Airlines' new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which use the highly efficient GEnx jet engine.  He talked to the pilot, who pointed out that a jet engine is a form of heat engine, just as is a power plant, but far more efficient.  Not only are the jet turbine materials designed to tolerate higher temperatures (~1300oC), the temperature at flight altitudes is much lower (-50oC) than the ambient temperature on the ground.  Indeed, jet engine efficiency is highest at the altitude of the tropopause, the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere, typically 15km (50,000 ft).    Orphy wondered why atmospheric temperature is lowest at this point.  Briefly, tell Orphy why the temperature of the atmosphere increases as you go further up into the stratosphere.

You are given a directed graph G=(V,E) with weights w(e)>0 for each edge e.  There are two special vertices labelled s and t.    There is a list L of edges that you can add to G.  Your goal is to add exactly one edge from L into G so that you minimize the length of the shortest path from s to t in the new graph.   The list L is an array L=[e(1),e(2),...,e(k)] where the i-th edge e(i) has endpoints (y(i),z(i)) and has weight a(i)>0. We tell you k=O(n), so there are O(n) edges to consider to add. Note, the k edges in L are not in the original graph G.  Use the algorithms from class as black-boxes, namely DFS, BFS, Explore, Topological Sort, SCC, and Dijkstra's.  Describe your algorithm in words. No pseudocode. State the running time in terms of n=|V| and m=|E|, and note that k=O(n) so k should not appear in your running time. Faster is worth more.  Hint: you should only need a few calls of one of the graph algorithms.  Your algorithm can output the length of the shortest path from s to t in the new graph or it can output the edge you added, your choice.  Also, you can assume that at least one of the edges in L will decrease the length of the path from s to t.

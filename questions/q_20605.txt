Write a C++ function: void update_cross_links(Node *head); Consider a linked list with two (horizontal) layers of nodes, see the illustration and the definition of a node below:   The layers have the same number of nodes. Nodes from opposite layers are connected by cross pointers. The traversal operation compares values of the corresponding nodes from the layers. If the values are not the same then the cross pointers of these nodes are assigned to nullptr, see the illustration:   Here is the definition of Node: struct Node {   int value;   Node *next;   Node *cross;   Node(int e) : value(e), next(nullptr), cross(nullptr) {}};Do not change the value of the next pointer.

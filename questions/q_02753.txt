They are then followed by firm 2, which chooses an optimal output level that is observed by firm 3. Finally, having observed both competitors' output choices, firm 3 decides their profit maximizing level of production. Each firm has a constant marginal cost of production c and no fixed costs. This market is populated by consumers whose inverse demand can be represented by the equation P(Q) = a + bQ. What is the subgame perfect equilibrium of this game?

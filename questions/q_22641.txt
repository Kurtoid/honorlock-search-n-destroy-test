Case Study #1b Scenario: Five-year-old Thomas is looking forward to starting kindergarten in the next few weeks. As a last summertime activity, his parents took him and his four older siblings to the county fair to enjoy the rides and see the animals. While at the fair, the family ate fair food, drank lemonade and soda, and wandered through the barns and petting zoo set up for the week.   Signs and Symptoms: Three days after the fair, Thomas and two of his sisters start to complain about feeling sick. Within a day, the entire family had severe stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. Over the next few days, the rest of family gradually started to feel better, but not Thomas. His diarrhea continued and became tinged with blood. His mother took him to the family physician, who noted that Thomas was pale and anemic. He asked Thomas to try to "pee in the cup" for a urine sample, but Thomas said he could not. The physician told the family to go immediately to the hospital. At the hospital, Thomas was diagnosed with acute renal failure and catheterized for a urine specimen. Samples of blood and stool were also collected and sent to the clinical lab.   Testing: The fecal specimen was plated on several types of differential and selective media, including MacConkey Agar and ChromAgar 0157, a selective and differential medium specifically for  Escherichia coli 0157:H7, a pathogenic strain of E. coli.

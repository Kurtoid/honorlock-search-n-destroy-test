A company uses the weighted-average method for inventory costing. At the end of the period, 22,000 units were in the ending Work in Process inventory and are 100% complete for materials and 75% complete for conversion. The equivalent costs per unit are materials, $2.65 and conversion $5.35. Compute the TOTAL cost that would be assigned to the ending Work in Process inventory for the period.

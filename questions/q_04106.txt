Use the case to answer the following question: You are a homecare nurse caring for An Older Woman with a Chronic Cardiac Condition Francis R., a 79-year-old woman, was admitted to a home care agency because of heart failure. She was hospitalized twice in the last six months for a toxic level of Lanoxin (digitalis) and an exacerbation of heart failure; she is no longer on Lanoxin. Francis lived in her small two-story home for many years. She received social security payments and some retirement income. Her daughters lived far away. She had a friend who drove her to appointments, purchased her medications, and took her to church regularly. Francis told the nurse that while she misses her husband and feels lonely at times. The home care nurse and Francis discussed heart failure and how she could manage the symptoms more effectively. Francis was very receptive to weighing herself daily, keeping a symptom diary and calling her providers when appropriate, using energy conservation techniques, elevating her legs regularly, and using an extra pillow to elevate her head and shoulders to decrease dyspnea while sleeping. She agreed to schedule the amount and time of her fluid intake based on the nurse's recommendations. She was pleased that the nurse arranged for the delivery of mobile meals that were high in iron, and would receive those meals beginning the next day. Francis and the nurse discussed her medications. The home care nurse described the benefits of using a medication reminder/organizer system; Francis was pleased that the nurse planned to bring a system later that week. Francis agreed to record notes about her medications, their actions, and their side effects in her symptom diary. Given the case, what social determinants of health are of concern for this patient? (select all that apply)

Determine the (a) annual straight-line depreciation and (b) the net book value for year 2. Part 2. Determine (a) the depreciation rate (per unit depreciation) and (b) the depreciation expense for this year under Units of Production if the equipment will last for 14,000 hours and it was used this year for 1,200 hours. Part 3. Determine (a) the depreciation expense for year 2 and the (b) Accumulated depreciation for year 2 using the double declining balance depreciation method.

Write a JavaFX GUI program with file name LastnameFirstnameExam5.java that meets the following requirements and adheres to the layout included sketch.  Must set the title of the window to be "1331 Exam 5 - YOURNAME", where YOURNAME is replaced with your first and last name. Must include some non-editable text at the top to the window (not the title) with a short phrase of your choosing. Change the text font to either Georgia, Papyrus, Courier New, or Comic Sans MS; it cannot be the default font. Font size should be 12. Must include a plain Button.  The button must toggle the color of the short phrase between Color.BLACK and your favorite color.  Make sure this color is still visible in the UI (i.e. the color should be dark enough to be seen). You must set the button text to something of your choosing.   Must use the provided image below. We recommend that you use an ImageView to display the image.     WARNING: We will be compiling this from the command line with the image file in the same directory as the source code. If you choose to use an IDE during development, make sure that you place the image in whatever directory will allow it to load by only specifying the filename without any path information. (i.e. you should open the file as "filename.png", not "..filename.png", "/Users/Pictures/filename.png", etc.)   Must include a select one-of-many toggle group to control the alignment of the image displayed. There should be 3 alignment options for Left, Center, and Right.  Hint: StackPane has a setAlignment method. You may place this group beside or below the image.  In order to actually see the alignment change you will need to ensure that your window/stage is large enough. So, you need to set the size of your stage to be large enough to see the change proportional to the the size of your image. A good ratio is to make the window 3 time the width and height of the Image. To do this you can use the following methods: stage.setMinWidth(X); and stage.setMinHeight(Y);   Must use a Spinner UI control that will control the opacity of the image.  The Spinner should have a minimum value of 0.0, maximum value of 1.0, initial value of 1.0, and a step amount (i.e. amount to step by) of 0.05 Hint: Opacity is specified as a value between 0.0 (completely transparent) and 1.0 (completely opaque). Another Hint: Look closely at Spinner's constructors to find one that allows for configuration of the min/max/init/step values on creation of the Spinner to make your life easier. Yet Another Hint: There are several ways to implement the event handling, we recommend using the setOnMouseClick method that is available to any Node   You must use at least one of the following children of Pane to control the layout of the Nodes: BorderPane, GridPane, HBox, or VBox. You must implement your event handling at least two of the three ways we taught: named inner class, anonymous inner class, and lambda expression.  For example, at least one handler as an anonymous inner class and at least one handler as a lambda expression. Failure to implement handlers in two different ways will result in the loss of points.   Points may be deducted if your layout deviates greatly from the one shown below. However, you do not need to have a border around the pane containing your image nor around the image itself. You may place the one-of-many button group below or beside the Image.  YOUR SHOULD ONLY SUBMIT A SINGLE JAVA FILE. ENSURE THAT ANY OTHER CLASSES YOU INCLUDE EXIST WITHIN THE SAME FILE. IF YOUR SUBMITTED CODE DOES NOT COMPILE, YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO. SAVE, BACKUP, AND TEST OFTEN! The following is an example layout for your UI, but as long as you meet the requirements stated above the layout is flexible:

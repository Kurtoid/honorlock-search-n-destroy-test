May 25, 2017 (CNN) Local and state health officials say potato salad made with home-canned potatoes is to blame for the more than 20 cases of botulism in Lancaster, Ohio, last week. All of those who are sick ate at a potluck dinner at Cross Pointe Free Will Baptist Church on April 19. Health officials tested leftover food samples obtained from the trash and interviewed ill patients to determine what common food all of them ate.

A paper presented a novel design of a low-cost and high-throughput thermoplastic PMMA Lab-on-a-Chip device for conducting microscale biochemical reactions.  The miniaturized plastic device was fabricated as shown below by utilizing PMMA substrates modified with a poly(dimethylsiloxane) interfacial coating.  Surface characterizations were carried out and bond strength was measured.        Fig. 1  Schematic showing the bonding mechanism of two PMMA substrates through a PDMS interfacial coating. (A) Plasma treatment of PMMA and attachment of APTES. (B) Subsequent coating of epoxy-PDMS on APTES-coated PMMA.  The APTES and epoxy-PDMS were linked via amine-epoxy bond formation. (C) Surface oxidation and subsequent contact of two epoxy-PDMS-coated PMMA substrates. (D) Bonding of two epoxy-PDMS-coated PMMA substrates by embossing at 80degC for 20 minutes under 0.1 MPa to form a siloxane bond (Si-O-Si) linkage.    (PMMA, poly(methylmethacrylate); PDMS, poly(dimethylsiloxane); APTES, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane)      Fig. 2 shows the results of the water contact angle measurements performed on the surfaces of PDMS (pristine) and PMMA (pristine, oxygen plasma-treated, APTES-coated, and epoxy-PDMS-coated) substrates. PMMA was used as the model substrate and pristine PDMS as a reference.  The PDMS is more (hydrophilic / hydrophobic) [1] than the pristine (pure) PMMA.  The plasma-treatment of PMMA caused the contact angle to exhibit more (spreading / de-wetting / advancing / receding) [2] behavior, indicating that the surface became more (hydrophilic / hydrophobic) [3].  This suggests the plasma-treated surface had become oxidized as needed for the reaction in Step A in Fig. 1.  The contact angle then changed again after the treatment steps with aminosilane (APTES) and then the epoxy-terminated PDMS.  After the treatments of PMMA substrate were completed to form a monolayer of PDMS, the water contact angle increased to a value almost equivalent to that of the pristine PDMS, suggesting that the PDMS monolayer was successfully grafted onto the PMMA surface.  - This was a nice quick test of their reaction steps, but if they wanted to be more rigorous, which method would be best suited for determining the actual chemical composition of the aminosilane modified surface (Step A)?  (ATR-FTIR / ESCA / AFM / EDS) [4] - Which tool might be best for doing a compositional depth profile to determine the thickness of the PDMS polymeric layer that was created in Step C? (ATR-FTIR / ESCA / AFM / EDS) [5]

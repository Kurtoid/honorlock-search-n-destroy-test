Chalupas restaurant is considering whether to  (1) bake bread for its restaurant  in-house or  (2) buy the bread from a local bakery.                                          The chef estimates that variable costs of making each loaf include $0.60 of  ingredients, $0.40 of variable overhead  (electricity to run the  oven), and $0.80 of direct labor for kneading and forming the loaves. Allocating fixed overhead  (depreciation on the kitchen equipment and  building) based on direct  labor, Roasted Pepper assigns $0.90 of fixed overhead per loaf. None of the fixed costs are avoidable. The local bakery would charge $2.15  per loaf.                                                In making its decision whether to bake its loafs of bread in-house or purchase its loaves of bread from the local bakery, Chalupa should compare its in-house cost of ________ to $2.15 to purchase each loaf of bread from the bakery.

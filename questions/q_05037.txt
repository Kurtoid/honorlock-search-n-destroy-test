At 9'oclock Saturday morning, the father and son left Cambridge Meadows, their upscale community. In 45 minutes, they arrived in Brewster Village, a less ritzy area. Calvin felt uncomfortable. They parked their 2019 BMW M4 on Elmhurst Street, which happened to be the street where Mr. Jamison grew up. Then, they began to walk through the neighborhood. While looking around the area, Calvin immediately noticed many differences. The streets in Brewster were busier and noisier than those in Cambridge Meadows. Traffic was heavier. More people were walking. A few stray dogs and cats wandered about. Above everything, what stood out most to Calvin was how happy the people were to see his father. As he watched his father's old friends and acquaintances greet Mr. Jamison with warm words, Calvin began to feel comfortable, as though he were at home. Suddenly, Brewster Village started to feel like a quite fortunate place. Which of the following best characterizes the tone of this paragraph?

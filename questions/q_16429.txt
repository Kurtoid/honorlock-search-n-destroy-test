Part A: Background In a small population, a team of epidemiologists has been studying the relationship between very low birth weight and risk of delayed development. Five years ago these investigators initiated a study. Using birth certificate files and delivery room entry logs, these investigators identified all full-term births over a 6-month period. The investigators enrolled all low birth weight babies and a representative sample of normal birth weight babies into their study. The investigators then examined the children every year until age 3 years. During the last examination, the investigators administered a standardized developmental screening test to assess personal-social, language, and motor-adaptive skills. Based on this test, the investigators classified the children into two groups: normal development and delayed development. The results from the study were:                                                                          Birth weight     Development   Low   Normal   Total     Delayed   140   77   217     Normal   220   283   503     Total   360   360   720

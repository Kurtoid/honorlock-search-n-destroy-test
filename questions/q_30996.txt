Medical guidelines recommend that a hospitalized patient who suffers cardiac arrest should receive defibrillation (an electric shock to the heart to restore normal rhythm) within 2 minutes. Medical researchers examined the medical records of 6716 patients who suffered cardiac arrest while hospitalized.  Here is what they found:         Time to Defibrillation         Hospital Size   2 minutes or less   More than 2 minutes   TOTAL     Small (less than 250 beds)   1124   576   1700     Medium (250 - 499 beds)   2178   886   3064     Large (500 or more beds)   1387   565   1952     TOTAL   4689   2027   6716       The difference in proportion of patients whose time to defibrillation was more than 2 minutes between small and large hospitals was estimated to be between 0.019 and 0.080 using a 95% level of confidence.  Is the difference in proportion of patients whose time to defibrillation was more than 2 minutes between small and large hospitals statistically significant at the 5% level of significance?

Out of a sample of 162 high school students, 89 struggle with math, and out of a sample of 136 college students, 47 struggle with math. You wish to test the hypothesis that high school students are more likely to struggle with math than college students. Choose the appropriate null and alternate hypothesis to test.  Let p(HS) represent the true proportion of high school students who struggle with math, and let p(C) represent the true proportion of college students who struggle with math.

[20pts]  A single part is made by two different sequential processes: shearing and bending. The demand for this part is 100,000 units per week.  The company operates 6 days per week, 8 hours per day, one shift per day. Each process has parts that are defective but can be reworked. Given the following performance data, find the number of each machine needed to meet the demand. Notice the time units are in seconds!    (a) [10pts] What are the input of parts to each process required to meet demand?             (b) [10pts] How many bending and shearing machines are necessary to meet demand?

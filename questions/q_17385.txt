The Campbell Company is considering adding a robotic paint sprayer to its production line. The sprayer's base price is $880,000, and it would cost another $20,000 to install it. The machine falls into the MACRS 3-year class, and it would be sold after 3 years for $500,000. The MACRS rates for the first three years are 0.3333, 0.4445, and 0.1481. The machine would require an increase in net working capital (inventory) of $15,500. The sprayer would not change revenues, but it is expected to save the firm $304,000 per year in before-tax operating costs, mainly labor. Campbell's marginal tax rate is 25%. If the cost of capital of projects such as this robotic paint sprayer is 18.70% then what is the NPV of this potential robotic paint sprayer project? *NOTE...depending on your rounding procedures, you might 'miss' MY version of the right answer by a few dollars (probably less than $100...maybe more like a few dollars). So in this case, you may (no guarantees) select the 'close' answer below.

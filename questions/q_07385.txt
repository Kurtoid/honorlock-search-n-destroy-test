A company has contracted to produce two products, A and B, over the months of June, July, and August. The total production capacity (expressed in hours) varies monthly. The following table provides the basic data of the situation:      June July August   Demand for A (units) 500 5000 750   Demand for B (units) 1000 1200 1200   Capacity (hours) 3000 3500 3000      The production rates in units per hour are 1.25 and 1 for products A and B, respectively. All demand must be met. However, demand for a later month may be filled from the production in an earlier one. For any carryover from one month to the next, holding cost of $.90 and $.75 per unit per month are charged for products A and B, respectively. The unit production costs for the two products are $30 and $28 for A and B, respectively.    Only develop a mathematical model to determine the best production schedule for the two products (do not find the optimal solution).

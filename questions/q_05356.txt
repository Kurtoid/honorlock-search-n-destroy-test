Your IoT network is located in an apartment building and uses an LTE smartphone service. Suppose towers in the LTE system transmit 20W of power at a frequency of 1800MHz, with a transmitter antenna gain of 15dB. Your smartphone has a receiver antenna gain of 3dB. ---------------------- Now suppose you have a noisy refrigerator (-50dBm) and a noisy air conditioner (-70dBm). To improve your smartphone signal inside your apartment, you could purchase an LTE booster. The booster would provide a gain of C dB, where C is a constant that you will calculate. Considering and including the previous path loss values that you calculated (loss from the tower and loss in-building), if the SNR for your cell phone is 6dB, do you need to buy a booster? --If yes, calculate the amount of boost you need. In other words, calculate C (in dB). --If no, calculate how much additional noise (Nadd) your apartment can generate before you will need to purchase a booster. Answer format: One of two answers:(1) The amount of boost needed is: _____________ dBor(2) An additional noise of Nadd=___________dBW could be present without need for a booster.

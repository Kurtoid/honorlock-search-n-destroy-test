Hugo hypothesizes that taking notes on a computer leads to reduced retention of information compared to taking notes by hand. To test his hypothesis, Hugo recruits 2 friends who usually take notes using a computer and asks them to take notes by hand for all lectures after the midterm exam. Hugo then compares his friends' final exam scores to their midterm exam scores and concludes that taking notes by hand is more effective because both of his friends scored 5 points higher in their final exam compared to their midterm exam. Given Hugo's experimental setup, is it safe to conclude that taking notes by hand leads to greater retention of information compared to taking notes on a computer? Explain.

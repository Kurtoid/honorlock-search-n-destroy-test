10a) Draw the new hardware on your scratch paper that will be necessary (if any) to accomplish the above task.  In which bdf file(s) and on what page number(s) of your handouts should this hardware be placed?  You can abbreviate repeated designs by using bus notation and proper labels. Use your scratch paper and label this 10a. --------------- 10b) Describe the change(s) needed (if any) to the G-CPU Controller Flowchart.  Demonstrate these changes by redrawing the relevant portions of the flowchart for the following 2 instructions: LDAA dddd,X and LDAB dd,Y.  It may be that not all of these instructions are affected. Use your scratch paper and label this 10b. --------------- 10c) Describe the changes that you will need to make to the G-CPU Controller Next State Table (if any).  Give excerpts from the relevant lines from this new file, corresponding to what was done in part b (with the instructions LDAA dddd,X and LDAB dd,Y).  Use as many lines as needed for each instruction.  (Include only relevant columns in addition to the ones shown below.  What other file(s) in the G-CPU handouts need to be changed?  It you will add any new circuits, draw them here. Use your scratch paper and label this 10c.

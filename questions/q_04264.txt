Write an organized, short essay in response to ONE of the following prompts that draws on multiple readings and lectures.  Your essay should respond to the question with a clear, consistent, and coherent argument; should organize material in a logical sequence; and should marshal specific evidence from readings, lectures, and discussions to support your thesis.  The best essays will draw on examples that represent a range of different time periods and places we have considered in this class (so, for example, a strong essay would have at least one example from before 1500, from roughly 1500-1900, and from after 1900.)  Your essay will specifically be evaluated on its ability to draw on and argue from evidence presented this semester, so you should not do additional research, and while you won't be penalized for bringing in additional historical examples, you would be wise to prioritize class material.  A central concern of military and political theorists is the right relationship between politics and political leaders on the one hand and war and military leaders on the other hand. How have various thinkers and leaders we've read or studied over the course of the semester theorized this relationship?  What was the ideal relationship they proposed, and how did this ideal vision relate to the actual relationship they observed around them at the time? "Total war" is one way that scholars have tried to categorize various conflicts according to their objectives, scale, and conduct.  Most--but not all--scholars argue that total wars were a particular historical phenomenon, meaning that they did not occur throughout history but were rather the product of a particular era and particular kinds of societies.  Critics of total war, however, argue that it is not a useful historical concept--meaning that "total war" was not unique to any one time or type of society.  Thomas Schelling, for example, provocatively stated that "war has often been 'total war' for the loser."  In your essay, you must do two things.  First, describe how "total wars" are usually distinguished from other conflicts based on their objectives and conduct, and explain the general historical theory of when and between whom total wars were fought.  Second, make a case for whether total war is rightfully understood as limited to any one era, or whether it might be an appropriate categorization for a broader range of historical conflicts.

One week after Alphonso announces his retirement he has the following conversation with Ralphie, during which they discuss the sale of Alphonso's house, which has a market value of approximately $1,000,000.     Ralphie: "Congratulations on your retirement!"   Alphonso: "Thanks! I am off to Florida just as soon as I sell my house."   Ralphie: "My wife and I love your house!  We could never pay you what it is worth.  We could only offer you $400,000, but you wouldn't sell it for that, would you?"   Alphonso: "Sold!  The house is yours for $400,000.  I'll have my attorney prepare the sale contract.  Now I am free to move to Florida!"

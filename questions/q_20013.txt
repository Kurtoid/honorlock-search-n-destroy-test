Problem #3 (25 points): The transistor in the amplifier below has the following s-parameters (Zo = 50 ): S11 = 0.8 [?]140deg, S21 = 1.89[?]55deg, S12 = 0, S22 = 0.47[?]-30deg      a) Design the input matching network for Gs = 0.26 [?]-30deg using a single stub matching network with short circuited stub. On the Smith Chart show the path taken (including direction).  On the figure above sketch the matching network identifying the lengths of all transmission lines. b) Microstrip transmission lines (with dimensions shown below) are used to implement the transmission lines in the matching network designed in a). Find the length of each microstrip line in cm if the frequency of operation is 4 GHz and the substrate dielectric constant is 3.5.

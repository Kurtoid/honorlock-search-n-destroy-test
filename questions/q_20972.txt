Fickle fleas   Daphnia magna is an aquatic species of crustaceans, commonly referred to as the water flea. These animals have 10 pairs of chromosomes, all of which are autosomal. Most water fleas are females that reproduce asexually. During asexual reproduction, a single female produces as many as a hundred offspring at a time. Each offspring is genetically identical to the mother (except for a few mutations). As winter approaches, however, some offspring develop into males and the population reproduces sexually. After having sex, a female lays a few large eggs, which must survive at the bottom of the lake until the water warms in spring.  Figure 1. Water fleas switch between asexual reproduction under favorable conditions (green cycle) and sexual reproduction under stressful conditions (red cycle).   Use this information and your knowledge of biology to answer questions 11-15.   11. During sexual reproduction, the population is more likely to evolve by genetic drift.

Argie's Argo Weapons is considering selling trademarked swords for UWF football games. The purchase cost for a 3-year franchise, today, to sell the swords is $25,000. If demand is good (35% probability), then the net cash inflows will be $40,000 per year for 3 years, with the first of these inflows seen at the end of year 1. If demand is bad (65% probability), then these same net cash inflows will be only $10,000 per year for each of the next 2 years then $5000 in year 3. Argie's cost of capital is 11%. If Argie makes the investment today, then it will have the option to renew the franchise for 3 more years at the end of Year 3 for an additional $25,000. In this case, the cash inflows seen in years 1, 2, and 3 will be repeated (so if demand was good (bad) in years 1, 2, and 3 it will continue to be good (bad) in years 4, 5, and 6). NOTE...the franchise fee payment, if made in the future (at year 3) should be discounted at a 'more sure thing' rate of 5%, rather than at the cost of capital.  What is the value of Argie's real option allowing for renewal of the franchise? (To answer, you should find the difference between the expected NPV of the project WITH and WITHOUT the potential choice to renew the franchise)

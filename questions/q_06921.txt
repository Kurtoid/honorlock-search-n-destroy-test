Show work if synthetic division was needed. List multiple zeros in each of the categories: rational first, irrational and complex. If there are none in any of these three categories, write "none" in all lower case.a) rational zeros (least to greatest with commas and no spaces): [x] b) irrational zeros (list negative before positive and use sqrt to designate square root symbol. Put commas between with no spaces.  Example: 2-sqrt(3),2+sqrt(3) ):    [y] c) complex zeros (List complex conjugates separately using "i" and listing the one with a negative imaginary part first and then the other that has a positive imaginary part.  Example: 1-5i,1+5i ): [z]d) on your work paper, write g(x) as a product of linear factors.

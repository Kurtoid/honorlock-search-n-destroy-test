A three-year-old boy lives in a very rural part of south Florida. His family is quite poor, so both of his parents (who dropped out of school in the seventh grade) have to work two jobs whenever they can. Because of this, the boy and his five siblings do not receive a great deal of attention, and their personal hygiene tends to be somewhat lacking. One day in late July the boy develops a series of red papules around his mouth and nose. By the next day, these papules have evolved into vesicles and pustules. Over the next 18-24 hours, the lesions start to break down, coalesce, and form thick, amber-colored, honeycomb-like crusts. The boy is not in pain and he doesn't really feel ill at all. Nevertheless, his face looks a little scary, and no one in the family has any idea of what the problem is or whether it might be contagious. As a result, it is decided that the boy's mother will take some time off from work and bring him to a local indigent clinic. The boy's vital signs are normal and there are no remarkable physical findings aside from the skin lesions. What is you differential diagnosis? (A vs B) what is the appropriate course of action? if referred out what would the treating provided prescribe?

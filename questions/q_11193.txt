A 2300:230 V (primary:secondary) transformer is rated at 50 kVA.  The equivalent circuit parameters are: R1 = 0.65 , R2 = 0.0065 , X1 = 1.1 , X2 = 0.011 , Bm = 0.022 S, and Gc = 0.014 S  Draw the approximate equivalent circuit for this transformer, referred to the low voltage side. Clearly label the value of each component.  Suppose that a load with a power factor of 0.8 leading is connected to the secondary side of the transformer. The load draws rated current from the secondary and the secondary terminal voltage is 230 V.  Determine the primary voltage.

Suppose in our hedged portfolio, total market value of bond A and bond B are MA and MB respectively. To find the values for MA and MB, write down the immunization equations with specific values (in other words, only MA and MB should be unknown in the equations). You do not need to solve for MA and MB. (Just typing it in text is fine. You can use * as the multiply sign, and / as the divide sign. No need to insert equations.)

Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr A 0.823 L sample of carbon dioxide, initially at 0.25 atm of pressure is compressed until it occupies only 93.2 ml.  If temperature remains constant, what is the final pressure, in mm Hg, of the gas? To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem.  Show your work (equation/and units) by using the equation editor () in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use   to insert ratios. Be sure to include proper units and the final answer! Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

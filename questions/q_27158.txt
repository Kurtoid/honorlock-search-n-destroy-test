As a summer intern for The Forest Creatures Company, which sells large size plush toys, you have been asked to review some of the inventory management processes for a particular product using the data in this file: Exam 1 Inv. Mgmt Problem v. 4.xlsx  Just as you have completed the initial assessment of the inventory management policies by calculating the ROP and EOQ and adjusting the EOQ for shipping constraints (full pallets and full trailers only), the manager walks in with disappointing news: the supplier has just informed the company that it has streamlined its ordering procedures. The supplier has now set a new, higher MOQ (minimum order quantity) requirement but has also reduced the ordering costs. So the Forest Creatures Company may need to adjust its order quantity to the new MOQ. The manager is really upset thinking this change will cost Forest Creatures more money and wants to stop doing business with this supplier and look for alternatives if the total annual extra cost is more than 10% of the old annual cost. However, the manager is willing to listen to your advice based on some analysis before taking any action. Can you compare the total annual costs (i.e., inventory carrying and ordering) for the old EOQ and the new MOQ policies? What course of action will you recommend to your supervisor regarding the supplier decision? Work in the spreadsheet and enter your answers in the blanks below. Do not enter any spaces, punctuation, dollar signs, etc. unless specifically requested. Use whole numbers for units and pallets. Enter monetary values in dollars and cents. Use a period (.) to separate dollars and cents. Reorder point (ROP): [1] units Safety stock (SS): [2] units For the current situation: Economic order quantity (EOQ): [3] units EOQ rounded to full pallets (FPOQ): [4] units EOQ adjusted to full trailers (FTOQ): [5] pallets Annual ordering cost using whole number of orders (AOC): [6] Annual carrying cost of cycle stock (ACCcs): [7] Annual carrying cost of safety stock (ACCss): [8] Total annual costs (AOC+ACCcs+ACCss): [9] For the new situation with MOQ: Minimum order quantity (MOQ): [10] units MOQ adjusted to full trailers (FTOQ): [11] pallets Annual ordering cost using whole number of orders (AOC): [12] Annual carrying cost of cycle stock (ACCcs): [13] Total annual costs (AOC+ACCcs+ACCss): [14] Based on the total annual costs comparison for the two scenarios, will you recommend the manager should look for a new supplier (yes or no)?

To acidify the lumen of lysosomes (compartments in the cell involved in breakdown and recycling of biomolecules), V-type ATPase transporters are used to pump protons (H+) into the lumen (interior) of the lysosome. If the pH of the inside of the cell (cytosol) is 7.4 (4 x 10-8 M H+) and the luminal pH of the lysosome is 4.0 (1 x 10-4 M H+), calculate the free energy for a mole of protons (H+) to be pumped from the cytosol into the lumen of the lysosome. Note: We can consider, when determining membrane potential, that the movement of a solute molecule from the cytosol into the lumen of a lysosome is the same as movement from the inside of the cell to outside the cell. Assume: DGt = RT ln(C2/C1) or  DGt = RT ln(C2/C1) + Z FDps T= 310 K R= 8.315 J/mol*K F= 96,480 J/mol*V (Faraday's constant) Dps = -50 mV (membrane potential, inside)

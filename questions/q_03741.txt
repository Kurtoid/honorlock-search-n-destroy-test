FULL SOLUTION PROBLEM:  For the following question, write down the final answers here, but you must submit a full solution including Given, Find, EQU, all mathematical steps, and include units.  Work on this problem should be submitted to Test #3 Work Submission assignment no more than 15 minutes after the completion of this test. A child of mass m=40 kg starts from rest and slides without friction from a height h= 8 m along with a slide next to a pool (see the figure below). She is launched from a height h/4 and at an angle th = 25deg above the horizontal into the air over the pool. Define the configuration when the child is at the water level as having zero gravitational potential energy.   Make a table of knowns and unknowns [1 pt.]. Find the potential energy change of the child when she moves from the top of the slide to the launching point [1 pt.]. Determine her launching speed at the end of the slide [2 pts.]. Determine her maximum range in the horizontal direction (x_max) [1 pt.].

A very busy nurse working at the end of her third 10 hour shift in a row made two bad mistakes with the same patient. First, she forgot to double-check the label on I.V. solution she was hanging to make sure it matched the order for the patient. Then she forgot to check the setting on the I.V. pump.  The patient received a liter of hypertonic fluid in less than 15 minutes instead of receiving the same volume of the ordered isotonic fluid in 2 hours. How will the patient's body attempt to compensate for the nurse's mistakes? A) The patient will secrete more ADH so that more water can be reabsorbed from the filtrate. B) The patient will secrete more aldosterone so that more Na+ and water can be reabsorbed. C)  The patient will secrete more ANP so that more Na+ and water can be secreted into the urine.

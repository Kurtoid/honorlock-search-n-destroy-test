Visualize a neuromuscular junction. An impulse has been sent to the effectors (muscle cells) for a response. At rest, the endplate region has the following concentrations of sodium and potassium: [Na+in] = 145 mM, [Na+out] = 11 mM, [K+in] = 149 mM, and [K+out] = 255 mM. Remember that when acetylcholine binds to its receptors, a large opening of channels becomes permeable to both sodium and potassium. What is the membrane potential of the endplate region when stimulated by acetylcholine in this response at 37degC, R=1.987 and F=23062

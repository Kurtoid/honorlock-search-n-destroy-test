Integrating sources in MLA papers     Read the following passage and the information about its source. Then decide whether each student sample uses the source correctly.

Many told me that without used clothes they would go naked, which, as one pointed out, is not in their traditional culture. And yet they know that something precious has been lost.     "These secondhand clothes are a problem," a young driver named Robert Ssebunya told me. "Ugandan culture will be dead in ten years, because we are all looking to these Western things. Ugandan culture is dying even now. It is dead. Dead and buried." The ocean of used clothes that now covers the continent plays its part in telling Africans that their own things are worthless, that Africans can do nothing for themselves.     Packer, George. "How Susie Bayer's T-Shirt Ended Up on Yusuf Mama's Back." The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2003, edited by Dave Eggers, Houghton Mifflin, 2003, pp. 224-36.

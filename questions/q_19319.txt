State any two verifiable non-functional requirements for the IDE [2 points].   Describe the "Create Project" use case in detail, listing the actor actions and system responses in sequence for the main (success) scenario using the two-column format discussed in the class. Note that in the main scenario, a new project is created from scratch, i.e., there is no existing source code [3 points].   Describe an alternative scenario where the project is created from existing source code in a directory [2 points].   Draw a use case diagram showing the actor(s) and six use-cases, one of which must be "Create Project." [3 points].

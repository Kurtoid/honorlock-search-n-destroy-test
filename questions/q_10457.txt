Pebble-bed nuclear reactor is a design for a graphite-moderated gas-cooled nuclear reactor.  The basic fuel design features spherical fuel elements called pebbles.  Consider the tennis ball-shape fuel elements as a sphere with internal heat generation and constant properties.  Heat is generated uniformly at a rate of S per volume.  The ball has constant thermal conductivity k and radius R.  The ball is exposed to a gas cooling media with a heat transfer coefficient of h.  The temperature of the cooling gas media is T0.  Find out the temperature distribution in the ball under steady state condition. Hint: (1) temperature in the ball has to be finite; (2) surface temperature is controlled by convective heat transfer)

As the assistant to the CFO of Bighit Inc., you must estimate its cost of common equity. You have been provided with the following data: CF0 (Cash flow at year 0)= $0.80; PV0 (Present value at year 0) = $22.50; and g (growth rate) = 8.00% (constant).

(30 points) AST Consultants Inc. v. Herrera United States District Court for the District of East Carolina   This is a defamation suit in federal court.  Defendant Amy Herrera is a Virginia-based writer who runs a website called "Green Intensive" from her home in Alexandria, Virginia.  Herrera uses her site to comment on environmental issues and other topics.     In February 2021, after a visit to East Carolina, Herrera posted an article on her site that was highly critical of AST Consultants Inc., an environmental-litigation consulting firm incorporated and based in East Carolina.  In the previous year, AST had generated expert opinions and environmental impact reports that were offered into evidence by companies in a number of recent high-profile lawsuits, which involved financial responsibility for efforts to clean up oil spills off the coast of East Carolina.     Herrera's article described AST's work as "dubious," "biased," "sketchy" and "inaccurate," and referred to the company as "the East Carolina-based best friend of the nastiest, biggest-ticket polluters."  The article closed by expressing a wish that state officials would investigate AST's activities for potential civil or criminal misconduct.               Last month, AST filed a lawsuit against Herrera in the United States District Court for the District of East Carolina, asserting that the statements on her site constituted the tort of defamation under East Carolina law, and seeking $500,000 in damages.  AST contends that Herrera's statements were deliberate falsehoods that were damaging to AST's reputation and business.[1]                 East Carolina has a statute that imposes special requirements on plaintiffs who bring lawsuits that the statute defines as being potential "SLAPP" suits - "strategic lawsuits against public participation."  See generally George W. Pring & Penelope Canan, SLAPPs: Getting Sued for Speaking Out (1996).  Supporters of such statutes - called "Anti-SLAPP Acts" - argue that large businesses often threaten their critics with costly-to-defend tort actions, using legal theories such as defamation and tortious interference with contract, in order to intimidate the critics into silence, thus chilling free expression and public criticism of business interests.  Accordingly, many states have enacted Anti-SLAPP Acts to limit lawsuits believed to be likely to chill public participation.               Section 1 of East Carolina's Anti-SLAPP Act ("Act") defines a SLAPP suit as any suit that "(1) involves communications made to influence a government action or outcome, (2) which results in a civil lawsuit (3) filed by a public or private entity against an individual or group, if (4) the communications relate to a substantive issue of some public interest or social significance."  You may assume that a court would conclude that AST's suit qualifies as a SLAPP suit under this definition.                Section 3 of the Act provides that a plaintiff in a SLAPP suit cannot obtain any discovery from the defendant unless the plaintiff first "demonstrates to the court at a hearing, through presentation of affidavits, documents, or other evidence, that the plaintiff has a strong basis for its belief that damages will prove to be recoverable in the case."               Citing Section 3 of the Act, Herrera has refused to make initial disclosures or respond to any of AST's discovery requests seeking information about the basis for her statements.  Herrera argues that the Act applies fully to this lawsuit, and that she accordingly has no obligation to respond to discovery, unless and until the hearing specified in the Act is held and the judge finds that AST's claims have a strong basis.                 AST, however, argues that no such hearing need be held, because Section 3 of the Act is not applicable in federal court.  Rather, AST argues, the matter should be governed by the procedural rules that ordinarily govern the timing and nature of discovery in civil actions in federal court.     Talks between the parties have broken down, so AST has filed a motion to compel Herrera to respond to its discovery requests.  That motion is now ready for decision by the federal district judge.     Should the federal district court grant AST's motion to compel discovery, or should it hold the evidentiary hearing described in the Act?  Explain.               (Note: In the course of your analysis, you should make clear what federal provisions are potentially at issue.)      [1] Herrera has not disputed the existence of personal jurisdiction.

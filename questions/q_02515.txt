Match the amino acids in each blank with the best matching characteristic(s) listed below. For each blank, list the numbers for all the characteristics that fit that amino acid, separated by commas (e.g. 2, 5, 6). Unless otherwise stated, all of the amino acids are at physiological pH of 7.4. There can be more than one characteristic for many of the amino acids. Make sure to list them all. However, there will be a deduction for incorrect answers, so don't list unnecessary characteristics. Not all characteristics must be used.  Characteristics: 1. acidic side chain 2. non-chiral amino acid 3. basic side chain 4. side chain can be modified by adding phosphates to form phosphate ester 5. involved in disulfide cross links 6. is converted to tyrosine by hydroxylation 7. has more than one amino group 8. only straight or branched hydrocarbons in the side chain 9. polar, non-charged side chain 10. has a charge of +2 at pH = 1 11. aromatic side chain 12. would probably be a neutral mutation (one that has no effect on the properties of the mutated protein) when this amino acid is changed to arginine 13. condensation with ammonia (NH3) would result in the formation of an amide in its side chain Match the amino acids below to the characteristics above: Blank #1: lysine Blank #2: serine Blank #3: cysteine Blank #4: glutamic acid Blank #5: phenylalanine

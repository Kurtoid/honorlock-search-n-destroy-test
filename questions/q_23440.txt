Well flow (20 pts): An unconfined aquifer water table is 12.2 m thick has a full penetrating well with a diameter of 4-in (0.1 m). The extraction rate is 0.15 m3/min in the aquifer that is sandy with a hydraulic conductivity of 8.2 m/day.  A steady-state drawdown of 1.5 m is observed in a monitoring well at 3.0 m from the pumping well. Determine the: a. ) drawdown in the pumping well at this pumping rate, and b.) minimum distance from the pumping well that a monitoring well must installed in order for there to be no drawdown observed (in the monitoring well) (i.e., where is s= 0.0 m).

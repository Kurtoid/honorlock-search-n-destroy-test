Problem #3 (25 points): A quantum well edge emitting laser is 300mm long, 2.5mm wide and has four 60A wells in the active region. Assume the internal loss is 20cm-1, the optical confinement factor is 0.01 per well, and the reflectivity of the as cleaved mirrors is 30% each.  A)  Calculate the threshold modal gain, and threshold material gain. B)  If the logarithmic gain parameters are g0=1800cm-1 and ntr=1.8x1018cm-3, calculate the threshold carrier density. C)  Calculate the threshold current. Assume A=1x108s-1, B=1x10-10cm3/s, and C=5x10-29cm6/s.

Question 5 Exploratory Data Analysis Quantitative Variables - 4ptsNow consider the quantitative variables ONLY: Age, Annual.Salary, Credit.Card.Debt, and Net.Worth. Compute the correlation coefficients between each quantitative variables and also the response variable.  A) Which predicting variable has the best correlation with the response? B) Interpret the value of the best correlation coefficient in the context of the problem. Include strength (weak, moderate, strong) and direction (positive, negative).   C) Considering the predicting variables, does the correlation matrix show signs of multicollinearity? Explain how you came to your conclusion.
An orthogonal pair of images are considered images taken at angles of 90 degrees from each other. One example is:
John is 35 years old. He is 6'1" tall and weighs 176 lb. He jogs everyday to work and back home. His office is 2 miles away, and it takes him 30 minutes each way. Using the same information about John above, John's diet should include...
Discuss the effect of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) on three different individuals whose preferences are represented in the following graphs. Their initial point (before the implementation of the EITC) is given by point P. Discuss the effect of the EITC on hours worked and labor force participation. Also, whenever possible, compare the magnitude of the changes in hours worked for the three individual. Sketch an indifference curve showing where the individuals will be after the EITC is implemented. Also discuss the overall effect of the program.

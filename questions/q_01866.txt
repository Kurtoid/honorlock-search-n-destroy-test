Questions 26 and 27 go together: Shemp LLC was interested in purchasing the Fine & Howard Family Limited Partnership's premier asset, Curly Office Tower. Shemp had its broker contact Fine & Howard's representative to "take Fine and Howard's temperature" for a potential deal. Fine & Howard responded it would be interested if, but only if, the deal terms were satisfactory. During the course of preliminary negotiations between Fine & Howard and Shemp, Shemp found Fine & Howard's proposals to become increasingly unsustainable, then preposterous, and finally insulting. Shemp instructed its broker to meet again with Fine & Howard's representative "one last time" to determine if Fine & Howard is "truly serious" about negotiating a deal. If Shemp's broker concludes Fine & Howard is not credible, it is authorized to inform Fine & Howard that Shemp will engage the "nuclear option" and would terminate the negotiations. Assuming no additional facts, Shemp may properly engage the "nuclear option" as described. (Select one answer only.)

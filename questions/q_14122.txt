Ethan had a very bad year. He wrecked his car in March when he ran a red light (because he could not see properly having left his glasses at home) and crashed into another car completely destroying his cars. The insurance company paid out the value of his car and he purchased a new car with the insurance proceeds. Ethan decided that since he had insurance, it really did not matter if he took care of his new car because he could always get a new one. Ethan got in the habit of leaving his new car unlocked and it was stolen. After Ethan bought another car he decided that he didn't like that car and really wanted a new one, so one day he purposefully set his car on fire. In his carelessness, he also caught his leg on fire. Ethan decided he didn't want to go back to work.

In connection with the acquisition, Argo paid $10,000 in legal fees and agreed to pay $50,000 to the previous owners of Sylvestre contingent on the firm meeting certain net income goals in the following year. Argo estimated the present value of this probability adjusted expected payment for the contingency at $15,000. In determining its offer, Argo noted the following pertaining to Sylvestre:  It holds a building with a fair value $40,000 more than its book value. It has developed a customer list valued at $22,000, although it is not recorded on Sylvestre's books. It has in-process R&D activity with an appraised fair value of $30,000. However, the project has not yet reached technological feasibility. All other assets' and liabilities' fair values approximate their carrying values.  Prepare all journal entries Argo Company should record associated with this information. Be sure to use appropriate form. For online students, I suggest you use the Table function in Canvas.

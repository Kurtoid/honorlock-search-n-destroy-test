Evidence Based Practice:  Estimation of endotracheal tube cuff pressure utilizing subjective techniques are consistently inaccurate as compared to objective techniques.  Estimation techniques include minimal leak, minimal occlusion, estimation of air for inflation, and palpation of the pilot balloon.  The use of a manometer is an objective technique and should be used to directly assess ETT cuff pressure. Direct assessment of ETT cuff pressure reduces the risk of ischemic tracheal injury. (Stewart, 2003)     Subsequent studies support the findings by Stewart, et. al.     Based on the evidence, the most effective way to avoid tracheal ischemia due to high endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff pressures is?

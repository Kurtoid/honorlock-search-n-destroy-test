Question 3START THIS QUESTION ON A NEW PAGE. Here is a rough model of a car with a passenger in it. The car + wheel+ tire + suspension is shown by spring-mass-damper system ( kc, Mc, cc). The passenger + seat system is modelled by a spring-mass-damper system ( kp, Mp, cp ) on top of the car system. The car moves on a road whose height is given by a variable u measured from a fixed reference height (ground). Find the TF from u to the passenger displacement yp. Show all the relevant FBDs.  (20 points)  Just to explain how the variables work:u is the height of road w.r.t. to a fixed ground. It's an absolute coordinate.  yc is the height of the car-mass relative to the road. It's a relative coordinate. yp is the height of the passenger-mass relative to the car. It's a relative coordinate.Hence, if at some random instant in time, u=1 and let's say yc = 2 at that instant of time, and let's say yp =3 at that instant, then the road is up by 1, the car has moved up in total by 1+2=3, and the passenger has moved up in total by 1+2+3=6, from their original equilibrium positions.

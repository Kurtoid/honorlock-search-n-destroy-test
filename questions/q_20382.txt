QUESTION 3     A student wanted to measure the volume of a gas and use the results to find the volume occupied by one mole of the gas. The following method was used. *       A sample of calcium carbonate was weighed out in a small plastic container. *       45 cm3 of hydrochloric acid of concentration 3.00 mol dm-3 was added to a conical flask. A small pinch of calcium carbonate was  added to the acid. *       The container was placed in the conical flask and a gas syringe was connected to the top of the conical flask. *       The flask was carefully shaken so that the small plastic container fell over, allowing the acid and calcium carbonate to mix.   Right click the button below to open the apparatus set up in a new window.      The student repeated the experiment five times using different masses of calcium carbonate on each occasion, with the concentration and volume of the hydrochloric acid constant.     Experiment number   Mass / g   Volume of CO /cm3     1   0.10   17     2   0.20   23     3   0.30   46     4   0.40   62     5   0.50   98           3.1   Write the equation for the reaction between calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid with state symbols.   (2)     3.2   Calculate the molar mass of calcium carbonate.   (1)     3.3   Show which reagent is in excess and that it is the same reagent in each experiment.   (3)     3.4   Plot a graph of volume of carbon dioxide produced against mass of calcium carbonate.   (2)     3.5   Use the graph to show that the volume of gas produced depends directly on the mass of calcium carbonate added.   (1)     3.6   Use these data to calculate the volume (under these conditions) of two moles of carbon dioxide gas. Give your answer to two significant figures.   (2)     3.7   Describe what precautions were taken for these specific reagents.   (2)     3.8   Why would the experiment need to be repeated five times?   (1)
What source of lipids should be substituted for saturated fats to help lower blood cholesterol levels?

For several days, a woman postponed raking up some leaves on the sidewalk in front of her home. Early one rainy day, she heard a loud noise, followed by crying, coming from outside. When she ran outside, she found her next door neighbor sprawled face-down on the sidewalk in front of her home, with one of his front teeth knocked out. In a panic and feeling guilty about the wet leaves on her sidewalk, the woman picked up the tooth and immediately drove the neighbor to a local dentist's office. There, the woman signed a paper stating that, if the dentist would attempt to save the neighbor's tooth, she would pay the bill. It soon became apparent that the neighbor was highly intoxicated at the time of his fall and that he had passed out on the woman's sidewalk, rather than slipped on the leaves. If anything, the leaves actually helped the neighbor by cushioning his fall. The dentist was successful in saving the neighbor's tooth and sent the woman a hefty bill for his services. When the woman realized the truth of the situation, she refused to pay, and the dentist brought an action to recover the amount of his bill. In the dentist's suit against the woman, which party is likely to prevail?

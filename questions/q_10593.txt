Greenhouse Gas Emissions April 22 is Earth Day: Human's activities discharge billions metric tons of greenhouse gases into Earth's atmosphere every year. The data file  greenhousegas.txt  contains actual statistics of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (in the unit of million metric ton) from year 2000 to 2018. Five columns in the file are for [1] Year, [2] Carbon dioxide (CO2), [3] Methane (CH4), [4] Nitrous oxide (N2O) and [5] Fluorinated gases. Write a C program to read every row of data from the file greenhousegas.txt  and store the data into 5 one-dimensional arrays with appropriate data type. The program should display tabulated data with 3 decimal places. Then, the program has to automatically determine the year that had the highest amount of emission for each gas, by utilizing the function maxIndex(). Create a C function called maxIndex(). Use any repetition statement within the function definition of maxIndex() to determine the array index that holds the maximum value among all elements in the input array. The function maxIndex() accepts two arguments and returns a non-negative integer. Those two arguments of the function are:  a one-dimensional floating-point array  an integer variable that indicates the number of elements in the floating-point array.  Ex. If the input array contains, in order, {1.5, 5.7, 8.3, 4.7, 6.8, 2.1}, the function maxIndex() should return 2 since index 2 contains the maximum number among all the elements.  An example of output dialog is shown below: U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions (million metric tons of CO2 equivalents) Year  CO2        CH4       N2O       F-gases    2000  5998.070   703.011   423.310   151.006    2001  5900.437   695.650   438.522   137.866   2002  5942.652   688.418   436.646   146.744   2003  5991.960   688.031   437.144   137.977   2004  6107.618   681.719   446.697   145.635   2005  6131.893   679.562   432.633   147.683   2006  6051.051   683.954   428.714   150.670   2007  6128.430   685.670   439.933   162.422   2008  5930.540   691.692   423.646   164.251   2009  5491.036   680.198   422.461   160.211   2010  5698.056   682.336   431.424   169.797   2011  5565.294   656.270   421.856   177.113   2012  5367.569   646.830   392.263   174.013   2013  5514.029   642.458   439.175   173.889   2014  5561.719   639.011   449.265   179.021   2015  5412.432   638.483   443.821   181.635   2016  5292.268   624.245   426.067   181.501   2017  5253.606   630.304   421.259   183.065   2018  5424.882   634.457   434.529   182.782     The highest CO2 emission was in 2007The highest CH4 emission was in 2000The highest N2O emission was in 2018The highest F-gases emission was in 2018   Hint:   In the main function, call the function maxIndex() by passing an array containing data of each gas to receive the return value; and use it as an array index to locate the element in the array 'year'.

Review the paragraph and answer the question below. Aerobic Exercise vs. Strength Training There are two major types of exercise--aerobic exercise and strength training--and each has distinct benefits. Aerobic exercise includes activities such as running, biking, and swimming. When people do aerobic exercise, they breathe hard and their hearts beat fast. It also increases their endurance. Strength training involves lifting, pushing, or pulling something, usually something heavy. Pushing one's body up from the floor using one's arms, as happens when performing a push-up, is an example of this kind of exercise. Strength training burns fat and builds muscles. Which kind of exercise is better? This is a difficult question to answer. Aerobic exercise burns energy faster, so it might help a person lose more weight. Research has shown an additional benefit of this kind of exercise: It can reduce stress. On the other hand, when more of the body is muscle, the body burns more energy, so strength training can help with weight loss as well. In addition, strength training exercise makes bones stronger. Finally, this form of exercise gives muscles an attractive shape, so it may make a person look better. Both types of exercise have benefits and can help people live longer, healthier lives. For the best physical health possible, people should include a combination of both in their weekly exercise program.  What is the topic sentence? Write it below.

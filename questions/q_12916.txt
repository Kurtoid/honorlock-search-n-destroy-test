A husband and wife have a combined income of $80,000. They attended 10 performances of opera in the previous year, and this number just exactly matched their individual demands for opera. Ignoring ticket prices, if their joint income rose to $100,000 and the husband and the wife individually based their demands for opera on their joint income, how many operas could they agree to attend if the husband's income elasticity of demand for opera is 2 and the wife's income elasticity of demand for opera is 0.5?

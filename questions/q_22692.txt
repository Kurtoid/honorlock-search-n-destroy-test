This image is showing the activation pathway regulating melatonin secretion.  Specialized neurons in the retina (located at the back of the eyeball) detect changes in light.  Axons from those reginal neurons send their axons to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus.  Neurons there, then send their axons to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.  In turn those neurons send axons to the intermediolateral cell column in the spinal cord, which is where autonomic neurons are located.  These autonomic neurons send axons to the pineal gland.   Functionally classify the following neurons shown in this reflex.    melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cell - afferent neuron with soma in the suprachiasmatic nucleus - associational neuron with soma in the intermediolateral cell column - efferent

Bart operates BitBART, a complex of Internet servers through which he offers a number of BitTorrent or "torrent" sites. BitTorrent is a technical protocol for exchanging files online, enabling BitTorrent users to share very, very large files, such as motion pictures. Each of Bart's torrent sites offers users a searchable index of copyrighted songs, motion pictures, videogames, and computer programs that can be downloaded from other BitTorrent users on BitBART. A BitTorrent user who searches one of Bart's sites for a given work will be directed to a .torrent file associated with a BitTorrent copy of that work. A .torrent file consists of information on where to find that work among users in the online BitTorrent environment. In the BitTorrent system, files are not necessarily uploaded or downloaded on a one-user-to-one-user basis. Files are distributed among "seeders" and "leechers," "Seeders" are BitTorrent users who supply content; "leechers" are BitTorrent users who are searching for content to download. The .torrent file allows leechers to identify seeders who are hosting the content being sought. Using .torrent files to locate seeders, leechers can obtain all or part of the relevant content from multiple seeders. Virtually all BitTorrent users log on using pseudonyms, however, so individual users are extremely difficult to identify. Is Bart liable for copyright infringement for any unauthorized uses of copyrighted songs, motion pictures, and other content being accessed and exchanged via BitBART?

Question IIA With certain exceptions for law enforcement officers in their official capacity, Florida does not permit its residents to openly carry a firearm in public.  Given the civil unrest in our country and a growing distrust of law enforcement,  there has been pressure on lawmakers to allow gun owners who obtain a license and pass background checks to be able to openly carry a handgun in public.  You are an intern for a Congressman who has asked you to explain the constitutional right declared in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and as applicable to the state of Florida. QUESTION:   WRITE A LEGAL ANALYSIS FOR YOUR CONGRESSMAN. WOULD SUCH A LAW CONFLICT WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND THE SUPREME COURT'S INTERPRETATION?   USE CASES AND LAW DISCUSSED IN CLASS IN YOUR ANALYSIS.

Read the abstract provided below and determine the type of review:  AbstractObjectives: To locate reports of sexual health education interventions for young people, assess the methodological quality of evaluations, identify the subgroup with a methodologically sound design, and assess the evidence with respect to the effectiveness of different approaches to promoting young people's sexual health. Design: Survey of reports in English by means of electronic databases and hand searches for relevant studies conducted in the developed world since 1982. Papers were reviewed for eight methodological qualities. The evidence on effectiveness generated by studies meeting four core criteria was assessed. Judgments on effectiveness by reviewers and authors were compared. Papers: 270 papers reporting sexual health interventions. Main outcome measure: The methodological quality of evaluations. Results: 73 reports of evaluations of sexual health interventions examining the effectiveness of these interventions in changing knowledge, attitudes, or behavioural outcomes were identified, of which 65 were separate outcome evaluations. Of these studies, 45 (69%) lacked random control groups, 44 (68%) failed to present preintervention and 38 (59%) postintervention data, and 26 (40%) omitted to discuss the relevance of loss of data caused by drop outs. Only 12 (18%) of the 65 outcome evaluations were judged to be methodologically sound. Academic reviewers were more likely than authors to judge studies as unclear because of design faults. Only two of the sound evaluations recorded interventions which were effective in showing an impact on young people's sexual behaviour. Conclusions: The design of evaluations in sexual health intervention needs to be improved so that reliable evidence of the effectiveness of different approaches to promoting young people's sexual health may be generated.

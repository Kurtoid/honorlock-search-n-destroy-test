It may not be reproduced, posted or distributed without permission of Arizona State University and L. Chattin.  Construct a 95% two-sided confidence interval on the population death rate (p) from lung cancer.  The upper bound of this confidence interval is [x].  The point estimate of the death rate is [y].  We must have a sample of size n = [z] if we want to be at least 95% confident that the error in estimating p is less than 0.025, regardless of the true value of p.  Select the answers closest to yours.

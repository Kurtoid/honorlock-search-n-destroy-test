Passage Questions:   CRISPR-Cas9 technology and its application in haematological disorders Over the past two decades, advances in molecular biology and genetics have greatly extended our knowledge of haematological diseases. However, the characterization of genes of interest remains a great challenge. The optimal way to unravel the roles of particular genes is to manipulate their functions via gene deletion, insertion, or modification. Earlier genome editing technologies, such as homologous recombination (HR), have facilitated the manipulation of genes by generating knockout and knock-in cells or mouse models. However, HR-mediated targeting is a less efficient, time-consuming, and labor-intensive process, rendering its widespread application difficult. In subsequent decades, targeting of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) using engineered nucleases, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), was introduced to stimulate cellular DNA repair pathways: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). In most cases, NHEJ-mediated error-prone DNA repair generates random insertions or deletions (indels), leading to frameshift mutations. If an exogenous donor DNA template is available surrounding the DSB, then the DNA damage can be repaired via an HDR pathway, which leads to precise gene modifications or gene insertions. Although ZFNs and TALENs have resulted in more efficient and applicable site-specific genome engineering, the expansion of their applications has also been hampered by complex procedures, low specificity and high cost. The most recent development, the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9) technique, has initiated a new era of genome editing by overcoming the limitations of these earlier methods. In 2003, the function of the CRISPR system [was discovered], proposing that CRISPR is an adaptive immune system that protects microbes against specific infections. Two independent groups reported similar conclusions, and their finding was confirmed by experiments showing that CRISPR provides acquired immunity against viruses in prokaryotes. During the past 4 years, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been overwhelmingly adopted as a powerful tool in biological research, ranging from the modification of plants to the creation of animal models and the alleviation of human diseases including haematological diseases. Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA) is a rare inherited pure erythroid aplasia that only affects RBCs with decreased erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow. The main cause of DBA is the mutation of ribosomal protein genes, which leads to ribosomal stress and TP53 (p53) activation. In addition to bone marrow transplantation, glucocorticoid hormones as well as other supplementary therapies have been used to improve RBC production in DBA; however, many side effects and unresponsive cases have been reported. Recently, one research group successfully rescued haematological defects in a zebrafish DBA model by inactivating tp53 (p53) in erythrocytes via a CRISPR-Cas9-based vector system. This finding exemplifies the effective use of a CRISPR-Cas9 in vivo genetic model and its further development in model organisms other than zebrafish.

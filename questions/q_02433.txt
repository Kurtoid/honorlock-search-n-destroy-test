Once a white blood cell surface receptor has been activated by a non-self cell or molecule, it can RESPOND in several different ways:  White blood cells can proliferate and divide rapidly to create more white blood cells to attack the invader. White blood cells secrete signaling proteins (ligands), in this case, called "cytokines", that prompt other white blood cells to respond to the infection. The white blood cells can turn into cells that can kill or eliminate the microbe. Trigger inflammation - induce fever in the local area or the whole body  To initiate these changes in immunological cells, a certain SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION pathway has to be initiated by antigen binding. Listed below are the players in the signal transduction pathway for activating blood cells.  Components:                       Arachidonic acidCa2+ ion channel receptorCa2+ ionsCa2+ pump  Calcium-dependent effector enzymesDAG (Diacylglycerol)G-protein linked receptorG-proteinGDP-bound formG-proteinGTP-bound form   IP3 (Inositol triphosphate)Phospholipase CPhospholipase APIP2 (Phosphatidylinositol bis-phosphate)     Pay attention to the components with bold fonts only. The ultimate response of your body is to activate white blood cells to destroy the invading microbes by the three mechanisms listed earlier. However, a related part of the response to a serious infection is the onset of a fever. A fever is something your body does to itself (on purpose), not something the microbe does to you. A fever is triggered by cytokines secreted by the activated white blood cell. One way this happens is by enhancing the breakdown of DAG into molecules called prostaglandins. DAG is altered by an enzyme called Phospholipase A to produce arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid can then be converted (via the cyclooxygenase pathway, don't worry about the specifics of this pathway) to produce prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are released into the bloodstream by the white blood cells, and SIGNAL the hypothalamus to secrete epinephrine (aka. adrenaline) to increase your heart rate. A sustained increased heart rate results in increased blood flow. Increased blood flow and increased metabolic activity (including the production of waste heat) cause over-all body temperature to rise, resulting in fever-level warmth. When you have a fever, one recommendation often made to help you feel better is to take aspirin to reduce the fever. The molecular mechanism of aspirin is to block the cyclooxygenase pathway. Importantly, taking aspirin does not result in a reduced ability to fight off the infection. Questions about this overall case: What type of signaling is done by chemokines secreted by white blood cells to breakdown the DAG molecule and produce prostaglandins

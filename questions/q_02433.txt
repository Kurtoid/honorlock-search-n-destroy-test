The Precision Scientific Instrument Company manufactures thermometers that are supposed to give readings of 0degC at the freezing point of water. Tests on a large sample of these thermometers reveal that at the freezing point of water, some give readings below  0degC  (denoted by negative numbers) and some give readings above  0degC  (denoted by positive numbers). Assume that the mean reading is  0degC  and the standard deviation of the readings is 1degC. Also assume that the frequency distribution of errors closely resembles the normal distribution. A thermometer is randomly selected and tested. Use technology to find the temperature reading corresponding to the given information.Find P40, the 40th percentile.

3) (25 pts) Iron is body centered cubic (BCC) material, which has the favorable slip system {110}.  The critical resolved shear stress is 27.5 MPa. (a) An engineer is doing tensile test on a single crystal iron.  The stress of 35 MPa is applied along [001] direction. (a-1) please calculate the resolved shear stress of the slip along    (a-2) determine whether the dislocation slip will take place.   (b) If this engineer performs the tensile test along [001] direction on single crystal iron, (b-1) draw the general look of the stress-strain curve; (b-2) explain the mechanistic causes of the different stages; (b-3) explain how temperature affects these stages; (b-4) explain how stacking fault energy affects these stages; (b-5) If multiple slip systems were activated, how does the stress-strain curve look like?
La. = bony landmark. The structure labelled with the number "8 (la.)" is called the _______
11. A 20-kg block is connected to tr 30-kg block by a string that passes over a frictionless pulley. The 30-kg block is connected to a spring of negligible mass with a force constant 250 N/m as in the figure below. The spring is unstretched as shown in the figure, and the incline is smooth. The 20-kg block is pulled a distance of 20 cm down the incline so that the 30-kg block is 40 cm above the floor and is then released from rest. Find the speed of each block when the 30-kg block is 20 cm above the floor (that is when the string is unstretched).

You are a scientist in a biotech company that produces custom engineered tissues for patients. Your current project is to develop a bone replacement for a 30-year-old patient who lost part of his pelvis through cancer. At the team meeting, you propose using adipose-derived stem cells isolated from the patient for this project in combination with a scaffold made from the synthetic polymer poly-l-lactic acid.   1. To ensure that the fabricated scaffold does not degrade quickly, your team performs standard accelerated hydrolysis studies. What 2 methods will you recommend they use to monitor degradation? (4 points) 2. After the study, your team discovers that the polymer degrades very slowly, and not appropriate for bone engineering. Give 2 recommended changes to the polymer (poly-l-lactic acid) to increase the rate of degradation. (6 points)
Read the passage about Sarah and then answer the questions in complete sentences.  Copy/Paste the questions in the answer space and then write your answer. Ana y Jose cenaron en un restaurante nuevo que esta cerca de la casa de Ana. Jose le pidio el menu al camarero. El camarero les dijo las especialidades del dia: sopa de cebolla, ensalada de lechuga y tomate, y jamon con pure de papas. Ana pidio la sopa y el jamon. A Jose no le gusta la carne de cerdo. Prefiere la carne de res. No le gusta la cebolla, pero le encantan los champinones. El camarero le recomendo los champinones con aceite y ajo, y la hamburguesa con queso. La cena estuvo (was) excelente.    ?Donde cenaron Ana y Jose?    ?Cuales son las especialidades de la casa?   ?Quien pidio el jamon y la sopa?   ?Que le recomendo el camarero a Jose?   ?Como estuvo la cena?   a   e    i    o    u   n

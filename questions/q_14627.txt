Required:  Use the Canvas table function (use the formatting below as a guide) to prepare the necessary journal entry(ies) required in the Capital Projects Fund to record the following transactions related to the construction of a building by Saffron City.  Saffron City adopts a formal budget and uses encumbrance accounting.  The City adopts a capital budget at the beginning of the year.  To finance the construction of the building, the City anticipates receipt of a transfer $3 million from its General Fund, sale of $2 million of general obligation bonds, and receipt of a state grant of $1 million. It appropriates $6 million for construction. The City General Fund transfers $3 million to the Capital Projects Fund for the new construction project. The state approves the City's application for a $1 million construction grant and simultaneously sends a check to the City. The grant is expenditure driven and thus requires that Saffron City incur qualifying expenditures. Saffron City awards a construction contract in the amount of $5.4 million for the construction of the building. The City issues $2 million face value of general obligation bonds to help finance the construction and received proceeds of $2.5 million.  The bond covenant states that any bond premiums must be used for debt service payments accounted for in the City's Debt Service Fund.  The City pays $15,000 in bond issue costs associated with these bonds. The contractor sends a progress billing to Saffron City in the amount of $3.2 million. The bill is approved by the City's engineers and a payable for the construction costs is prepared, less a 10% retainage pending completion of the building and final approval by the City. For purposes of the state construction grant, Saffron City assigns the first $1 million of the billing to be the state's share of the cost. The payable for construction costs in f., above, is paid. The contractor completes construction and sends Saffron City a bill for the remaining $2.2 million. The City's engineers inspect the building and spent $40,000 to hire another contractor to remedy any defects identified. After all work is completed to correct the defects and a final inspection is made, the City approves and pays the final payment on the construction contract.  Be sure to label each entry using the lettering above (A-J).

Statutory Provision and Case Excerpt for Question 22   Statutory Provision Health Code SS 244.14. Dogs to be restrained. A person who owns, possesses or controls a dog shall not permit it to be in any public place or in any open area abutting on a public place unless the dog is effectively restrained by a leash or chain not more than six feet long.   Case Excerpt In September 2005, the plaintiff sued the defendant and the owner of the house for personal injuries as a result of her encounter with the dog. She alleged a first cause of action based on the defendants' supposed knowledge of the dog's "prior history of vicious propensities"; and a second cause of action for negligence, essentially premised on the local leash law, section 244.14 of the City Health Code.    When harm is caused by a domestic animal, its owner's liability is determined solely by application of the rule of strict liability for harm caused by a domestic animal whose owner knows or should have known of the animal's vicious propensities. Just last year we unanimously affirmed an appellate level decision rejecting the notion that a negligence cause of action survives in such a case. Here, the defendant's violation of the local leash law is irrelevant because such a violation is only some evidence of negligence, and negligence is no longer a basis for imposing liability, given our decision last year.      Which of the following statements best summarizes the relationship between the statutory provision and the case excerpt?

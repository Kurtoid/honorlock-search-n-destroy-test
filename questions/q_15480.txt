QUESTION 5 A 0,5 kg block is joined to a 0,3 kg block by means of a light string. The 0,3 kg block hangs vertically as the string is passed over a frictionless pulley. A horizontal force of 6 N is applied to the 0,5 kg block which slides along the horizontal surface as shown in the diagram below. The 0,5 kg block experiences a frictional force of 2 N. Right click on the blue button, to open the diagram in a new tab.       5.1   State Newton's Second Law of motion.   (3)     5.2   Draw two labelled free body diagrams to show:  The horizontal forces acting on the 0,5 kg block and the vertical forces acting on the 0,3 kg block.   (4)     5.3   Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration of the system.   (3)     5.4   Calculate the magnitude of the tension T in the string.   (2)     5.5   What would the magnitude of the applied force need to be for the system to move at constant velocity?   (3)             [15]

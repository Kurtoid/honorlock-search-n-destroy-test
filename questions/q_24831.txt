Raymond is a 33-year-old Asian-American male who works as a reference librarian in the township library. At the beginning of the intake interview, Ray stated that he would get nervous about everything, particularly things at work. He said that he gets more anxious than other people do. When asked to give an example, Ray said that he was up for a promotion that he didn't want, because it would involve having to lead trainings and be the focus of other people's attention. Ray described feeling very self-conscious when he works the reference desk, and is constantly worried about what others may think of him. Upon further questioning, Ray stated he was fearful of situations such as eating in public, initiating conversations with others, and speaking up to his boss, and that he avoids interacting with most people except his parents. In most of these situations, Ray said that his fear and avoidance is related to his worry that he will say the wrong thing, not know what to do, or that others will judge him.  Ray said that growing up, he was always shy, and kept to himself most of the time. He does not have any siblings, but says that he has close relationships with his parents who live nearby. He denied having close friends, he is not currently in a romantic relationship, and denied ever having a serious girlfriend because he was too shy to ask someone out. Ray denied using drugs and alcohol regularly, but said he may have a drink or two before going into a social situation to "calm his nerves." Ray stated that he's been so anxious lately that he has been getting 3 or 4 migraines a week.

If the difference in energy between the two chair conformations of trans-cyclohexane-1,2-dithiol is 1.99 kcal/mol and the DGdeg (eq to ax) for an SH group is 1.20 kcal/mol, what is the energetic penalty of the SH/SH gauche interaction? Report your answer to two decimal places in kcal/mol and do not include the units or the algebraic sign.
ISIQEPHU B: UKUFINGQA UMBUZO 2  Fundisisa lesi siqeshana esingezansi bese usifingqa ngamaphuzu ayi-7, ubhale ngezinto ezenza abantu bangakwazi ukonga imali.     IMIYALELO: 1.    Bhala ngemisho ephelele, amaphuzu angu-50 kuya-60. 2.    Imisho yakho mayibe nezinombolo kusukela kweyoku-1 kuya kweye-7. 3.    Bhala iphuzu elilodwa emshweni ngamunye. 4.    Ekugcineni kwamaphuzu wonke owabhalile, bhala inani lamagama owasebenzisile.             TEXT B         UKONGA  IMALI     1   Uyakwazi yini ukugcina imali? Lona umbuzo okufanele wonke umuntu azibuze wona ngoba imali ibalulekile kakhulu. Ukwenza ibhajethi kuyasiza ngoba uyakwazi ukubona ukuthi unemali engakanani ongayisebenzisa.Kungabe sonke siyakwazi ukunamathela ebhajethini esiyenzile?     2   Abaluleki bezezimali baveza ukuthi abantu abakwazi ukuhlela indlela yokusebenzisa imali. Kukhona abantu abenza izikweletu ezingaphezu kwemali abayiholayo noma abanayo. Iningi labantu ligcina selinegama elibi, kuvaleke namathuba okuthola usizo lwemali emabhange nakwezinye izindawo ezibolekisa ngemali.     3   Ukuzifaka ezikweletini ezingenaso isidingo kuyingozi. Kukhona abantu abahlela ukwenza imicimbi ngemali abangenayo kodwa abasazoyiboleka. Lemali abayibolekayo iba nenzalo (interest) eningi okwenza kube nzima ukuyikhokha. Kuhle ukulinda ungazifaki ezindlekweni (expenses) ezingenasidingo.     4   Kunabantu abanezinhliziyo ezingaphandle, abafuna ukuba nayo yonke into abayibona kwabanye. Bathenga izinto abangazidingi ngenxa yomona wokuthi abafuni ukudlulwa ngabanye. Lokhu kuyingozi ngoba awulazi iphakethe lalowo muntu ozifanisa naye.     5   Izindleko/izidingo zethu ziyakhuphuka zonke izinsuku. Kubalulekile ukubeka imali ukuze ikusize ukubhekana nesimo sokukhula kwezindleko zakho. Abantu uma bebona imali abanayo iseningi bayisebenzisa yonke kungabi namali abayongayo/abayibekayo. Ukucabangela ikusasa nokulandela uhlelo lokonga imali kuyasiza ukubhekana nesikhathi esinzima.     6   Wonke umuntu uyakuthanda ukuzimela abe nebhizinisi lakhe. Ibhizinisi lidinga ulwazi. Ukuzibambela kwezezimali ebhizinisini nokungaqashi umuntu onolwazi kungenza ukuthi inzuzo yakho ingakhuli. Osomabhizinisi kufanele nabo bafane nabasebenzi babo bazifake ohlelweni lomholo. Lokhu kuzobasiza ukubona imali engenayo nephumayo. Ucwaningo luveza ukuthi abantu abaphila ngezikweletu bangama-80%. Umuntu onganaki ukukhokha izikweletu zakhe uyazibulala ngoba ugcina esekhokha inzalo efakiwe. Ukungabheki izipesheli uma uthenga kuqeda imali. Asiqiniseke ukuthi senza izinto ezibalulekile kuqala ngemali.         IsiZulu Esicwengiweyo ibhanga 11         Right click on button below to open TEXT B in a new page.

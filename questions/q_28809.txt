While CM is on rotation in Dr. Dolence's laboratory, he synthesizes a new compound (Manningpam). He believes that it may have anxiolytic properties. Consequently, he initiates a research collaboration with Dr. Brown to assess the anxiolytic viability of his compound. Dr. Brown decides to utilize Sprague Dawley rats and the elevated plus-maze to establish a dose-response for Manningpam and to assess the anxiolytic effect of Manningpam. Dr. Brown  also decides to measure general locomotor activity utilizing an open field behavioral assay to ensure that general activity is not perturbed. Based upon the data presented below what logical conclusions can you draw regarding the anxiolytic profile of this compound?

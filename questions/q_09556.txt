This is the same fact pattern as that above - Question 2 part D. Clint noticed that the Schedule K-1 he just received from ABC Partnership included a $20,000 ordinary business loss allocation. His tax basis in ABC at the beginning of ABC's most recent tax year was $10,000. Comparing the Schedule K-1 he recently received from ABC with the Schedule K-1 he received from ABC last year, Clint noted that his share of ABC partnership debt changes as follows: recourse debt increased from $0 to $2,000, qualified nonrecourse debt increased from $0 to $3,000, and  nonrecourse debt increased from $0 to $3,000. Finally, the Schedule K-1 Clint received from ABC reflected a $1,000 cash contribution he made to ABC during the year. Clint is not a material participant in ABC Partnership, and he received $10,000 of passive income from another investment during the same year he received the loss allocation from ABC. D. How much of the $20,000 loss from ABC can Clint deduct currently, and how much of the loss is suspended because of the excess business loss limitation (ignore prior 3 loss limitation rules)? If one is not applicable, enter N/A. Amount deducted currently = [A] Amount suspended = [B]

Cell phones emit electromagnetic radiation that may be linked to brain cancer. In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) featured a study published in the Journal of National Cancer Institute that examined cell phone usage and rates of brain cancer in children and adolescents. This study, along with many others, suggests there is no link between increased cancer risk and cell phone use in our youth. Yet, there are other studies that indicate there might be an increased risk of cancer.As part of ongoing research, scientists are interested in knowing if, overall, those who use cell phones are at greater risk for brain cancer than those who do not use cell phones. Scientists develop a hypothesis about cell phone use and cancer. Identify the hypothesis from the choices below.

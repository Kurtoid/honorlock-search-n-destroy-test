a) Write down the circulation form of Green's Theorem for the vector field F-={"version":"1.1","math":"F-=<fx,y, gx,y>"}. Give a brief description of any regions or curves in the theorem. b) Suppose you want to evaluate the line integral [?]C* dr-{"version":"1.1","math":"[?]C<sin y, x>* dr-"} where C is the triangle with vertices (0,0) , (p/2, 0), (p/2,p/2){"version":"1.1","math":"(0,0) , (p/2, 0), (p/2,p/2)"} oriented counterclockwise.

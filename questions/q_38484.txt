Indirect Approach Bad News Letter (word count at least 200 words so paragraphs 2 and 3 should be very detailed) Use the four-paragraph method for indirect bad news messages: 1) buffer, 2) reasons, 3) more reasons, then state bad news as either passive voice sentence or subordinate clause, 4) positive alternative, then contact info and polite closing sentence You are a part-time accountant. You provide Abby Smith, the owner of a small local retail company, with quarterly reports summarizing her income and expenses. You help her determine a budget and compare it to actual data to help make important decisions such as ordering merchandise and providing raises. After two years of continual losses in sales, you believe Abby must reduce her payroll. She has consistently refused to consider this suggestion in the past, stating that her employees are like family, and she cannot reduce their wages or fire anyone. She'd rather go out of business.  At this point, the data tells you that she will have to close her doors if she does not reduce payroll.  Eight people are on the payroll. Sales continue to decline. Even though she feels that her employees are like family, she cannot continue her business without reducing her payroll. She will need to reduce the wages of all eight employees or lay off three of them. Write a letter to Abby delivering the bad news. Make up addresses and any necessary details. Do not use the Tab key on your keyboard. To prevent accidental submissions, I've added a question at the end. If you accidentally hit the Tab key, you can move back to finish writing the message.

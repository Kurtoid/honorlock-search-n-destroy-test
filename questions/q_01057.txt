The database must first be saved to the Documents or My Documents folder, not a sub-folder, and named Exam3-Lastname-Firstname, where Lastname is replaced with your Lastname and Firstname is replaced with your Firstname. For example, Joseph Walkowicz would save the database as Exam3-Walkowicz-Joseph (the file extension .accdb will be added automatically).   When finished, get out of Access, (only those working on non-networked laptops, copy your one file to the Instructor's flash drive), and then turn in this Exam.   The instructions are as follows:  Create the Database using the name from above. Create the Table using the name Inventory. Add the 3 records, found below, after creating the Table structure. Add 1 more record (fill in all fields) on your own using your last name in the Item Description.

All Item Numbers consist of 2 uppercase letters, a dash, and then 4 numbers.  The dash should be embedded with the data when saved.   The Item Number is a unique number for the inventory. The Item Number cannot be left blank. The Description can be up to 30 characters long. The Description will always be in lower case. The Description is a mixture of letters, numbers, dashes, and spaces. The Description cannot be left blank. The Quantity on Hand is always entered as a whole number; e.g., 3, 8, 22, 385, etc. The Quantity on Hand is always displayed with one decimal place. The Quantity on Hand is between 0 and 400, inclusive. The Quantity on Hand cannot be left blank. The Cost can be entered with up to 2 decimal digits. The Cost is always displayed with 2 decimal places. The Cost is not displayed with a currency symbol. The Cost is always greater than 0. The Cost cannot be left blank. Create a Form, named Inventory Input, for this Table to be used for inputting records. The form should look like the one from class, vertical alignment of the fields, one record per screen. Enlarge the Form so that the whole screen may be used but not so big that either horizontal or vertical scroll bars appear. Change the Main Title from Inventory Input to the name of the company found in "c" below:  Centered 24 point font Use your last name followed by the word Hardware. For example, Gordon Carruth would use the title Carruth Hardware.   Add a Subtitle:  Centered 14 point font Place under the Main Title and name it: Add Inventory   Center all the fields on the Form. They should all line up on the form like what we did in class. Add a message to the right of the Item Number that explains how to enter the information into that field. Adjust the sizes of the boxes on screen so that they not only will show all information but also so that they do not take up space beyond what is needed. Right align the text in the boxes to the left of the fields:  Make sure a colon is at the end of each of these labels.   Left align the information displayed in all the fields where the data is typed in by the user. Add a button to the bottom-left of the Form:  To ADD a new record (data) to the table. When the user clicks on this button, the user should be taken to a new blank form so that they may start typing a new record without scrolling through any previously entered records.   Add a second button to the bottom-right of the Form:  To Close the Form. When the user clicks on this button, the user should not be prompted to save, saving should happen automatically.

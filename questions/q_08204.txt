The shown beam section is subjected to a vertical shear = 50 kip. The Moment of Inertia (I) for the W-shape is = 394 in4.  Determine the First Moment of Area (Q) at a section cutting through the shown point "a" in the beam flange to separate this part (from point a to edge of the beam section).  Q = A*distance,  Shear Stress t = VQ/It,  F = shear flow (q) * Spacing

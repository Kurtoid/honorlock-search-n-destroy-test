A researcher wishes to see whether there is a relationship between the caloric contents and the sodium contents (in milligrams) of 10 beef hot dogs.  She selects five brands of hot dogs, determined the caloric contents and the sodium contents (in milligrams) of each brand.  The data is listed in the table below.      Caloric Content, x Sodium content (mg)   150 380   170 470   120 340   120 360   90 300    Compute the value of the correlation coefficient (you may use your calculator).  Round the value to 4 decimal places.   Test the correlation coefficient for significance. Be sure to include your null and alternative hypotheses (including symbols - use the insert equation editor to do so),   If using the t-test: your t-critical value, your calculated t-test statistic, decision rule, decision, and conclusion.  The level of significance alpha, a = 0.05. If testing using table I, the statistically significant/critical value correlation coefficient, your calculated correlation coefficient, decision rule, decision, and conclusion.  The level of significance alpha, a = 0.05.   If applicable, find & interpret the coefficient of determination, R2. If applicable, find the linear regression equation. If not applicable, explain why it is not. If applicable, find the predicted sodium content if the caloric content is 160 calories. If not applicable, explain why it is not. If applicable, find the predicted sodium content if the caloric content is 200 calories. If not applicable, explain why it is not.

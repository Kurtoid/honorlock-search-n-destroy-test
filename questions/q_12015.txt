Write the article and quote elements taken from these three books (each one needs to be quoted (in general)). Imagine your reader doesn't know much about the genre or think it is not very serious/important/valuable. Try to reach a conclusion of why you think the genre is so popular today? Be as much completed as possible to get full points.   (Length = the equivalent to 4 US Letter pages (or half a Blue/Green book) - That is about between 120-140 lines here on Canvas)

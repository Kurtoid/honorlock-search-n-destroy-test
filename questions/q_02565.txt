Find the probability
1) Your research project involves a set of three Arabidopsis genes, which TAIR lists as 'unknown function'. Two of these (ABC1 and ABC2) are 90% identical at the protein level, while the third (ABC3) is 40% identical to the other two at the DNA level and has 65% protein identity. You obtain homozygous t-DNA knockout single mutants for abc1 and abc2, and they look the same as wild-type under all conditions that you grow the plants. Suggest a hypothesis for the lack of a mutant phenotype (5 points) 2) Given the response to the last question, you decide to try other approaches to finding a whole plant phenotype associated with altered expression of each member of this gene family. What functional genomic approaches that do not involve t-DNA or transposon mutants would you choose? Indicate whether the approach allows you to distinguish a specific function for each gene (5 points) 3) Can you hypothesize to which cell organelle ABC1, 2 and 3 proteins are targeted? IF yes, describe how you would test your hypothesis? Describe the anticipated results if your hypothesis is correct (5 points) 4) The centromere of eukaryotic chromosomes is essential for the faithful segregation and inheritance of genetic information. It contains highly repetitive DNA. They identified a repetitive sequence called pAL1 satellite repeat in Arabidopsis genome. Describe a cytological method to understand the distribution and copy number variation of the pAL1 satellite repeat in Arabidopsis centromeres (5 points)
PREDATION  The Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Model allows us to make predictions the of the prey and predator populations.  Question 6. Use Figure 10 to answer the following questions.    A. The isocline that intersects the y-axis at r/a is for predators or prey? B. If the populations start at the location of the black star, is the predator population growing or declining? C. If the populations start at the location of the black star, is the prey population growing or declining? D. f the populations start at the location of the black star, which quadrant will the population enter next? Be sure to address all 4 parts of the question. One word answers per question are sufficient.

SECTION 3-C - Analysis (30 minutes)Both the "Substantive Due Process" and Equal Protection Clause Rights make it harder for legislatures to enacts certain types of laws - and to do so even though legislators are subject to democratic procedures, that assure they are accountable to majorities of voters. Substantive Due Process does so by giving individual certain "fundamental rights" - and generally subjecting government to some form of heightened scrutiny when government regulates realms of human activity covered by those fundamental rights. Equal Protection Clause does so, in part, by defining certain types of classifications as "suspect" or "quasi-suspect" and subjecting government officials to heightened scrutiny when it uses such classifications. Please write an essay briefly describing: (1) The logic for each of these constitutional limitations on government. Why do the Supreme Court and other courts - after Griswold v. Connecticut - define certain realms of human conduct as subjects of "fundamental rights" under the Due Process Clause and treat them as, in many ways, off-limits to government regulation? Why do they treat certain classifications as "suspect" or "quasi-suspect" under the Equal Protection Clause? (2) How courts address situations where they are being asked to recognize a fundamental due process right they haven't recognized before, or treat - as suspect or quasi-suspect - a classification they haven't (so far) categorized as such under the Equal Protection Clause? What doctrinal or other tests do they use to address claims of this kind by litigants (for recognizing new fundamental rights or suspect or quasi-suspect classifications) - and in what respects (if any) do these tests follow from the logic of Due Process Clause or Equal Protection clause limitations on government power.

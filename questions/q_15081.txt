Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how many hours it has traveled. It should then use a loop to display the total distance traveled at the end of each hour of that period of time. (15 points) Do not hard-code the result values in your program. They must be calculated by using mathematical expressions based on the speed and the number of hours that the user inputs. Here is the example of the output:

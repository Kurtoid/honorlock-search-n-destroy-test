2:00 PM You are about to get your FIRST break of the day. As you are about to take your break, Dr. Bacillian calls you over for your experience in infection control in microbiology. He presents you with a gram stain of a slide made from a patient with odorous vaginal discharge.  You look at the slide under the 100x objective lens and you do NOT see anything on it. You ask Dr. Bacillian to tell you how the gram stain procedure was done so you can figure out what is wrong. Dr. Bacillian lists the steps as 1) made smear from the vaginal discharge, 2) air dried it, 3) starting adding the gram stain reagents in the proper order. Assume proper water washing, aseptic techniques were used, and gram staining was done.   What important step was deleted from the procedure? (2 pts)   Name 1 reason why this step is so important. (1 pt)

Assume the following exothermic reaction system is at equilibrium: X (g) + R (g)  = 2 Q (g) + A (s) When this equilibrium is perturbed by a stress, the system will respond in order to establish a new position of equilibrium.  Predict the specified consequence of each stress by selecting increase, decrease, or no change in the column labeled 'Effect'.     Stress Effect   When X is added to the vessel, the amount of R will [A]   When R is removed from the vessel, the amount of Q will [B]   When the volume of the vessel is doubled, the amount of Q will [C]   When A is added to the vessel, the amount of X will [D]   When the temperature is raised, the amount of R will [E]

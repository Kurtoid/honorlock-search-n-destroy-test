The Bubba-Dump shrimp processing plant generates 0.012 m3/sec of wastewater each day. The wastewater is treated in an active sludge plant. The average BOD5 of the raw wastewater before primary settling is 1,400 mg/L and the soluble BOD5 after primary settling is 966 mg/L. The microbial concentration entering the aeration tank is 80% of the combined inert and volatile portions of the mixed-liquid suspended solids of 2,500 mg/L. The aeration tank has effective liquid dimensions of 8.0 m by 8.0m long by 5.0 m deep. Find the food to microorganism ratio in the system (g BOD5/g MLVSS-day).

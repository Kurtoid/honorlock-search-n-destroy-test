Short Answer 2 Erika conducts a marketing study that examines the effect of packaging color on purchasing preferences.  She presents participants with a new brand of laundry detergent, and varies the color of the container: participants see either a brown, red, green or blue container.  Erika then asks participants to rate the likelihood that they would purchase the new brand of detergent, on a scale of 1 - 20 (higher scores indicate greater willingness to buy).  Erika hypothesizes that participants will be significantly more willing to buy the detergent in the green container compared to all of the other container colors, because the detergent is described as one that is eco-friendly and will not harm the environment.  Erika analyzes her data using a oneway between-subjects ANOVA, and finds an F-value that is significant (that is, she decides to reject the null hypothesis).    Based on her F-value, can Erika conclude that her hypothesis is supported?  Explain why or why not.

For a good first day at work
Begin Now(!) Following the Instructions (below)  Record the script you prepared and practiced into the text box for this question.  As stated in the rules in the instructor prep lesson prior to this test, you are allowed to have the printed script on a single sheet of paper in front of you on your desk or table.   Open Record/Upload Media or your alternate video recorder. Pan the camera around the room and desk to show that both the room and desk are empty. Show and video-record your photo ID. Put down your ID. Do not hold your ID in front to your face while speaking, The only way I have of knowing it is you completing the oral work is to see  both your Photo ID and then to see you speaking on the same recording (this procedure is called course authentication). Record with good oral expression (Record with feeling and friendly facial expressions); you are telling a story about "yourself" and you want to be certain that the listeners want to listen to you or even meet you. Your fluency (no hesitations and restarts) and "feeling" (good oral expression) will earn you points!  Your oral narration will tell me if you truly understand what you are saying. Take part of your set-up time to read the "Scene"; it will tell you exactly what I am looking for! When finished, follow the instructions at the bottom of this question.  Escena (Scene)   !Felicitaciones! You have been chosen to represent the college in a national, televised, speaking contest!   You are pretending to be the person in the paragraph, and you are talking via online video to an online voting audience about a day with your family and friends.   First prize is two years of full scholarship (including room and board), and a million-dollar scholarship endowment to the college!   Of course, you want to win the contest, and to do so you recognize that you must have such great pronunciation, fluency of speech, and oral expression, that the entire audience will want to vote for you - even the family and friends of your competitors!   If you are female, use your own name (instead of Pedro).   If you are male, use your own name (instead of Pedro).  !Buena suerte!  Step1: Oral Presentation  To begin recite the title of your story. Then video record your story exactly as it appears below.   If you are female, use "Ana" as your name. If you are male, use Pedro as your name.   Do not forget to end you presentation by saying goodbye using the language provided below the narrative.  Titulo (Title): !Un dia con familia y amigos!  !Hola! Me llamo (Pedro). El domingo pasado, a la una de la tarde, asisti a una reunion de estudiantes en el gimnasio de la universidad. Mi hermana, Alicia, y mi hermano mayor, Diego, tambien asistieron a la reunion. Diego llego a la reunion a la una y media. Pero mi hermana no llego hasta las dos. En la reunion escuchamos una presentacion de Juan Castro de Vega, el nuevo presidente estudiantil. Fue una presentacion maravillosa y llena de muchas grandes ideas. Step 2: How to End your Presentation  End your presentation by saying: Gracias a todos. Y, !nos vemos!  Step 3:  How to Correct before Submitting:  Before saving, listen to be sure you have good volume and you have a good, error-free, rendition;  If not satisfied, re-record as much as you wish. Save/Upload/Submit (whichever is appropriate for the recorder you are using), your final recording to this question. If you are using the Canvas Recorder, and you accidentally save or submit before you have finished, you may have to refresh the page to use the Canvas Recorder again. (But, since this is a one-attempt exam, if the refreshing action keeps you from accessing the question again, you will have to keep the recording you saved.) If you do end up with more than one recording in the text area, label the recording to grade as "Final" so I will know which one you want me to listen to and grade!

2.2   Read the following article on the effect loss of frog and amphibian populations increased malaria outbreaks and answer the questions that follow:   The global collapse of frogs and other amphibians due to the amphibian chytrid fungus increased malaria outbreaks in Costa Rica and Panama during the 1990s and 2000s, according to new research.   The findings provide the first evidence that amphibian population declines have directly affected human health and show how preserving biodiversity can benefit humans as well as local ecosystems.   The global spread of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, an extremely virulent fungal pathogen known as amphibian chytrid fungus, has been responsible for massive worldwide die-offs of amphibians since the 1980s. A 2019 study found the fungal disease has played a role in the decline of over 500 amphibian species over the past five decades and presumably caused extinctions of 90 species. The authors of that study referred to the die-offs as "the greatest recorded loss of biodiversity attributable to a disease."   Chytrid fungal disease travelled across Costa Rica and Panama from the early 1980s through the 2000s. Both countries experienced large increases in malaria cases following this rolling collapse of amphibian populations.   In the new study, researchers investigated whether these malaria outbreaks were connected to the amphibian declines because amphibians eat mosquitoes that transmit the disease. They compared the timing and spatial extent of amphibian die-offs with malaria cases in Costa Rica and Panama at the county level from 1976 to 2016.   The researchers found a significant increase in malaria cases in these countries that started immediately after the amphibian die-offs began and peaked 5 to 6 years after. In 1980, there were fewer than 1,000 cases of malaria in the two countries, but cases began to rise in 1990 and peaked at about 7,000 in Costa Rica in the mid-1990s and 5,000 in Panama in the mid-2000s.   Malaria cases went back down after this peak, and the researchers suspect this is due to local public health interventions like spraying of insecticides.   The results show some of the first evidence that species extinctions and biodiversity loss can directly affect human health, according to the researchers.   Other environmental factors like deforestation also played a role in worsening the outbreaks, but no other factor had as much of an impact on malaria cases as the amphibian declines, according to the study.

Solve the problem.A poll is conducted in a U.S. city to determine voting preferences prior to a presidential election. The following probabilities were obtained from the relative frequencies: P(D) = 0.51, P(M [?] D) = 0.22, P(M [?] D) = 0.77 where M represents male and D represents a person who plans to vote Democrat.Find P(M [?] D').
Convert the augmented matrix into a system of linear equations. Use x and y as your variables.
Use the following map to answer the questions that follow. Canvas will randomly select three of the five numbered station models. For each of these three station models selected by Canvas, indicate the observations requested. Label units! If you do not label units, you will not be able to get full credit. Each station model is worth 4 points. Note: You only need to answer this for the ONE station model per question listed below the map in BLUE. You will get three questions in a row that ask you for information for three different randomly-selected station numbers. If this is the first one you have seen, you will see two more stations in the next two questions. If this is the second one you have seen, you will see one more station in the next question. If this is the third one you have seen, this will be the last one; you do not have to answer this for every station labeled with a number.    Indicate the following observations for Location / Station Model 1: Temperature, Dew Point, Pressure, Wind Direction and Speed, and Cloud Cover Be sure to indicate which answer is which variable in your answer and don't forget to label units!

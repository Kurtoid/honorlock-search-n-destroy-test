Two solutions, initially at 24.60degC, are mixed in a coffee cup calorimeter. When a 100.0 mL volume of 0.100 M AgNO3 solution is mixed with a 100.0 mL sample of 0.200 M NaCl solution, the temperature in the calorimeter rises to 25.30degC. Determine the ^ Hdegrxn for the reaction as written below. Assume that the density and heat capacity of the solutions is the same as that of water. The specific heat capacity of water = 4.18 J/gdegC.     NaCl(aq) + AgNO3(aq) - AgCl(s) + NaNO3(aq) ^ Hdegrxn = ?

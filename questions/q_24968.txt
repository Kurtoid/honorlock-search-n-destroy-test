The keratinocytes of the stratum basale consist of a single layer of cuboidal to low columnar cells with a basophilic cytoplasm and large nuclei.
A 65-year old male presents with the following complaints for about 6 months: difficulty starting and stopping a stream of urine, hesitancy, dribbling, weakening force or size of stream and a sensation of a full bladder after urinating. He reports his symptoms are worsening and causing him to wake up 2-3 times per night. His digital rectal exam reveals a prostate gland that is non-tender, firm, smooth and rubbery. Symmetrical enlargement is found with obliteration of the midline median sulcus. The symptoms are consistent with which urological condition?
Indiana Co. began a construction project in 2018 with a contract price of $150 million to be received when the project is completed in 2020. During 2018, Indiana incurred $36 million of costs and estimates an additional $84 million of costs to complete the project.

As a biomedical engineer you are developing a reactor assembly, which produces alcohol for hand sanitizers. The initial system operates under steady-state conditions and it produces alcohol (ethanol, C2H5OH) from glucose (C6H12O6) according to the following reaction: C6H12O6 -  2 C2H5OH + 2 CO2 A diagram of this assembly is depicted below:       In order to increase the efficiency of this system you decide to make the following modifications (reactor assembly 2):  Some of the glucose from the exit stream is isolated through a crystallization process and mixed with the fresh feed of 2.0 kg before it enters the reactor. The gross feed, i.e. the total mass of glucose, which is fed directly into the reactor-subunit, is 19.0 kg. The single pass conversion of this subunit is the same as the conversion of glucose in reactor assembly 1.   a) Calculate the % increase of the overall conversion of glucose, which is achieved through the modification from reactor assembly 1 to assembly 2.  b) Calculate the mass-fractions of ethanol and in the product stream of reactor assembly 2. Calculations must be supported by a degree of freedom analysis.

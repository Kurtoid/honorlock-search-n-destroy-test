For this, what is the proper second and third argument values (X and Y) for the sem_init?  sem_t m;sem_init(&m, X, Y); // initialize semaphore msem_wait(&m)// * critical section here *...sem_post(&m)
Use the equation below to solve the following problem.    Calculate the number of grams of BaCl2 in 250 mL of a 0.300 M solution. To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem.  Be sure to include the answer. Or, solve the problem on your own paper and upload the picture into the Unit 3 Exam pictures dropbox immediately after submitting the exam.
A patient is coming to physical therapy with complaints of dizziness.  She reports her dizziness lasts for a short time (45 seconds) and is usually brought on when she rolls over in bed or reaches into her closet.  It also occurs when she bends down to pick up objects from the floor.  Her VOR appears to be functioning normally.  She demonstrates a positive Hallpike-Dix test.  Her balance is WNL with eyes open and eyes closed.  Her baseline vital signs are WNL.  What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?
A random sample of n = 50 individuals participated in a college success program that assessed student success. Each individual student completed 5 different assessments of student success (after 1st semester, 2nd semester, 3rd semester, 4th semester, and 5th semester). The data were analyzed to determine whether student grades improved or worsened over time. Some of the results are presented in the following summary table.  a. Complete the table by filling in the missing values.    Source SS df MS     F = [F-ratio]   Between Groups [SS_BG] [df_BG] 7   Within Groups [SS_WG] [df_WG]          Between Subjects 96 [df_BS]          Error [SS_error] [df_error] 2   Total 516 [df_total]       b. If the critical value is 3.44 for an alpha of 0.05, state your decision about the null hypothesis and interpret these results.

Case study #2 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is an enveloped retrovirus that has humans as its only reservoir. The spikes on HIV specifically bind to CD4 molecules of specific leukocytes and lymphocytes. After the viral genetic material is reverse transcribed by an enzyme known for its high error rate and poor proofreading, it is integrated into the host cell's chromosome. The virus then enters a period of latency. When activated, viral proteins are made using the same machinery and mechanisms as typical host cell proteins. Rapid viral replication results in the death of the host cell. A person with HIV has progressed to clinical AIDS when CD4 cells fall below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. (The CD4 count of a healthy adult/adolescent ranges from 500 cells/mm3 to 1,200 cells/mm3.)

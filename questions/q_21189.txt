Is the following experiment internally valid? If not, then identify the source(s) of threat. This study investigated two levels of drugs for treating excessive drinking. Outpatients at a community alcoholism clinic were randomly selected and assigned to one of two groups: (1) Drug A1 (Traditional) or (2) Drug A2 (Experimental). Patients in both groups received five structured sessions devoted to education about alcoholism through films and discussion of printed materials. In addition, the intervention for the patients in the Drug A2 group emphasized the importance of taking the drug at a set time, place, in the presence of another person, and they practiced this role-playing procedure in five sessions. Six months after the intervention sessions, patients in the traditional group reported being sober 15 of the previous 30 days while patients in the experimental group reported being sober 25 of the previous 30 days. Even though the experimental drug caused excessive regurgitation after ingesting, the authors concluded that the experimental drug (A2) was more effective in deterring alcohol consumption than the traditional drug (A1).      If this experiment is internally valid, then type yes as your answer.          If this experiment is not internally valid, then type the threat as your answer.

Novicon Solutions is affected by the following contingencies at the end of 2020:  It appears reasonably possible that Novicon will be awarded between $50,000 and $150,000 in a lawsuit against a competitor for patent infringement. It is probable that Novicon will be required to pay damages between $4,000,000 and $8,000,000 to an employee who sued the company for unethical behavior. Novicon's legal team believes that there is a remote possibility that the company will be required to pay between $500,000 and $1,500,000 in a lawsuit by a former vendor. The best estimate for the loss is $1,250,000. It is reasonably possible that Novicon will have to pay $750,000 to recall and fix products sold during the previous fiscal year.  What total amount should Novicon accrue for loss and gain contingencies in 2020?

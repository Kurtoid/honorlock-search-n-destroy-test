Mrs M. is a 64 year old Cuban-American who has a long hx of T2DM, peripheral vascular disease, retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, HTN, and former MI.  She is   5'3" and weighs 252 lbs.  She lives with her son, who is also obese, and does not understand the importance of diet.  Because of her problems, her son feels sorry for her and goes along with whatever she wants.  This solicitousness is usually centered around eating.  Her son works as a short-order cook and enjoys making dishes for her that she likes.  They live in Miami, where there is a large Cuban population and where many Cuban foods are available.  Some of the foods Mrs. M and her son eat on a daily basis are fried plantains, dried black beans, and chick peas.  Rice is always eaten with legumes.  Yams (yucca) are eaten more often than white potatoes, but French fries are consumed often.  Chicken and pork are more frequent choices than beef.  Their favorite vegetables include fried eggplant, beets and greens.  The vegetables are cooked with salt pork, ham or lard.  Mrs. M and her son drink several cups of strong coffee per day with sugar.  Sugar is also used in cooking; for instance, the plantains are fried in a skillet with a little oil and then sprinkled with sugar.  They even add sugar to yams.  Very little fruit is eaten, although they do drink orange juice on a regular basis.  They also eat many foods not common to the Cuban culture. Mrs. M's eye sight is poor, but she is not blind.  She enjoys watching her son bowl at the local bowling alley 2-3 times per week.  Whenever her son takes her to the bowling alley he buys her a cheeseburger, French fries, and a large soda.  She knows it is not good for her, but she does it anyway.  Sometimes she will drink a couple of beers while watching her son bowl. Mrs. M's kidney function is not seriously abnormal but it has been affected by her weight and hypertension.  Nephritic syndrome with the concurrent proteinuria and edema is slight, but her nephrologists is concerned it will become much worse is she does not start following her meal plan.  Mrs. M had a slight MI one year ago secondary to atherosclerosis.  Angioplasty was successful, and again she was warned she needed to change her meal plan or she could soon have more severe blockages.  A cardiologist explained to her that she would eventually require open-heart surgery if she did not lose weight and follow her meal plan.  All the emphasis on her meal plan was ignored.  After her MI, Mrs. M gained 40 lbs. due to the decreased activity.  She has agreed to see the RD again to try another meal plan. Mrs. M's labs were as follows: Glu       203 mg/dl         (70-110 mg/dl)           Na        144 mEq/L       (136-145) BUN    27 mg.dl           (6-20 mg/dl)                 K         3.1 mEq/L        (3.5-5.2) Cr        1.2 mg/dl          (0.6-1.1 mg/dl)             Cl         98 mEq/L         (96-106) Ca        9.1 mg.dl          (8.8-10.0 mg/dl)           Mg       1.9 mEq/L        (1.8-2.6) Ser alb 3.7 g/dl             (3.5-4.8 g/dl)                P          4.4 mg/dl          (2.7-4.5)    Determine Mrs. M's Calorie needs by calculating her BEE times stress and activity factors.

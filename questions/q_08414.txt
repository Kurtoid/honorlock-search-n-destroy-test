These questions are based on concepts from the discussion paper and from the lectures. Actin from rabbit muscle and Acanthamoeba are very similar sharing more than 95% sequence identity and the two can co-polymerize (form a microfilaments where the monomers incorporated randomly).   In a study, actin was isolated from either rabbit muscle or Acanthamoeba (an amoeba often used to study the biochemistry of the actin cytoskeleton). The actin was labeled with pyrene, a molecule that has low fluorescence when the actin is unpolymerized but fluoresces brightly when in the is polymerized. The actin was placed in a buffer and allowed to reach stead state; the critical concentration of both was 0.2 uM.   A soluble extract (all the soluble proteins) of Acanthamoeba was prepared in the same buffer as the isolated actins. The actin in the extract was present at a concentration of 50 uM. Approximately 20% (10 uM) of the actin in the extract was polymerized at steady state at room temperature. The unpolymerized actin in the extract was therefore at a concentration much higher than the critical concentration.   1.2 uM of polymerized Acanthamoeba actin was added to the Acanthamoeba extract; it remained completely polymerized with no depolymerization detected for up to 30 minutes. In contrast, when 1.2 uM of polymerized muscle -actin was added, it completely depolymerized with 20 seconds.   Co-polymers containing 10%, 50% or 90% muscle actin were prepared (tagged with either pyrene muscle actin or pyrene Acanthamoeba actin) and 1.2 uM of the copolymers were added to extracts.  In a series of experiments, it was found that after 20 seconds 100% of the muscle actin depolymerized in each case (see Table below). In contrast, in co-polymers in which 10% was muscle actin there was no detectable depolymerization of Acanthamoeba actin. When 50% was muscle actin, 6% of the Acanthamoeba actin depolymerized, and when 90% of the actin was muscle actin, 92% of the Acanthamoeba actin depolymerized.       Percent muscle actin in copolymer   Amount of muscle actin depolymerized when copolymer was added to  extract   Amount amoeba actin depolymerized when copolymer was added to extract     10%   100%   0%     50%   100%   6%     90%   100%   92%       Q3A (5 points): Suggest a mechanism to explain how muscle actin was depolymerized in the extracts even though the unpolymerized actin concentrations were well above the critical concentration.     Q3B (5 points): Suggest an explanation for why Acanthamoeba actin remained polymerized, until it was in copolymers that were mostly muscle actin.

A tiny wrasse fish primarily eats plankton. In this particular area, the water contains some mercury pollution from fallout from a nearby coal fired power plant. The mercury is found in tiny amounts in the plankton. As the wrasse eats more and more plankton over time, the amount of mercury in the wrasse increases because mercury is not processed by the liver, so it gets stored in the fish's fat tissue. The same thing happens to all of the other wrasse fishes who live in the same area. One day the wrasse is eaten by a young grouper fish. The grouper eats a lot of wrasses until finally the grouper is eaten by a shark. If we were to catch and autopsy the shark, we would find that the shark had large amounts of mercury in his fat tissue even though he did not consume any of the mercury containing plankton. Question: What happened to the wrasse fish is an example of _______; while what happened to the shark was an example of___________

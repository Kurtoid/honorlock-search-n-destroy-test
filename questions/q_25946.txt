Write an equation that can be used to compute the digital encoding d of analog signals using the variables V (input voltage), Vmax (maximum voltage), Vmin (minimum voltage), D (number of bits in digital encoding). Explain intuitively why your equation is correct. Apply that equation to convert a 7 V analog signal (assume that the analog input signal ranges from 0 to 9 V) to produce the digital value using an 8-bit encoding.

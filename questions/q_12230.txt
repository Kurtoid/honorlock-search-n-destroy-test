PREDATION  Question 4. Department of Natural Resource managers, biologists, and foresters in many states work together to successfully manage game populations by determining the number of deer, bear or other animals that can be harvested each year.

Seed masting is when plants produce seeds in synchrony (all at once and together) as a defense.

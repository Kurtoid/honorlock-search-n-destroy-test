Your friend works at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has discovered a brand-new virus that has recently been introduced into the human population. She has just developed a new assay that allows her to detect the virus by using PCR products made from the blood of infected patients. The assay uses primers in the PCR assay that hybridize to sequences in the viral genome.  Your friend is distraught because of the result she obtained (see Figure 10-28) when she looked at PCR products made using the blood of three patients suffering from the viral disease, using her own blood, and using a leaf from her petunia plant.  You advise your friend not to panic, as you believe she is missing an important control. Which one of the choices listed below is the best control for clarifying the results of her assay? Explain your answer. Figure 10-28

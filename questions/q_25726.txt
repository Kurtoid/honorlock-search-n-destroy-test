Case study #5 Listeria monocytogenes is a chemoheterotrophic facultative anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium that can act as a human pathogen or as a saprobe, depending on its environment. This bacillus-shaped cell is motile, moving with peritrichous flagella. This bacterium has a high salt tolerance and can multiply readily at 4 oC (refrigerator temperatures). L. monocytogenes is part of the normal gut microbiota of many farm animals, including cows. Deli meats, hot dogs, and unpasteurized cheese and milk are likely sources of this pathogen. Many antibiotics can be used to treat infection with L. monocytogenes, including drugs that target peptidoglycan biosynthesis, the small ribosomal subunit of bacteria, and folic acid biosynthesis.   What term(s) in the case study description supports your answer for what L. monocytogenes uses as a source of carbon and energy (what term(s) supports your answer to the previous question)?

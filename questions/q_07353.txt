Q 1[10 points]. The following data are diameters (in cm) of two types of pine trees.   Type I: 37.1  37.8  38.8  41.1  34.8  34.0  33.6  35.1  35.0  36.3  33.2  38.7 Type II: 32.4  40.8  31.8  27.1  36.6  25.0  28.7   28.3  30.9  27.6  33.2  Exam the data graphically using side by side boxplots and discuss your findings. What are the appropriate null and alternate hypothesis to compare the two types of trees? Perform the hypothesis tests that you listed in (b). Report test statistics & p-value. Summarize your conclusion Find and interpret 95%  confidence interval for the difference between the two means List and verify the assumptions required for (c )and (d).    Q2[5 points].  A student hypothesizes that freshman, sophomore, junior and senior college students have different attitude towards obtaining arts degrees. Based on his prior knowledge, he expects that the effect size is about 0.30.  For a power of 0.80 at significance level 0.05, what should be the total sample size. For a higher power 0.90, but same significance level What would be the required sample size?    Q3[15 points]. Use PimaIndiansDiabetes data in library(mlbench). Divide the data set into train and test data (random selection, 80%: 20%). The goal here is to model and predict if a given sample is diabetes Class 'positive (pos)' or 'negative (neg)'. A. Fit a logistic regression model for the above purpose.  Interpret your results. Use the model to predict both using training data and test data. Prepare confusion matrix and compare training accuracy and testing accuracy. B. Use Linear Discriminant Analysis for classification. Use the model to predict both using training data and test data.  Prepare confusion matrix and compare training accuracy and testing accuracy. C. Which method gives you better results. Explain. Q4[10 points]. Use the moth-trap data Click here to get the data We would like to see whether there is any  Factor A - 'location effect' on the  number of moths  Factor B - 'Type of Lure' effect  on the  number of moths and  Interaction effect on the  number of moths.   Perform required analysis and  report your results with necessary tables.  Verify any assumptions that are needed for the analysis you did. .

Read the following scenario and answer the question below.  Despite the high cost of the technology to design genetically modified (GM) crops, American companies have invested in their development. The first genetically engineered crop was the Flavr Savr tomato, which was created by reversing the function of a normal tomato gene. It was approved by the FDA for sale in the United States in 1994. Its grower, the Calgene Corporation, maintained that it would ripen longer on the vine, taste and ship better, and last longer on supermarket shelves compared to conventional tomatoes. It is no longer marketed because of technical problems and public safety concerns. Today, most engineered crops are modified for insect and herbicide resistance. In 1997, Monsanto Company first marketed GM corn. This Bt corn was engineered using genes from the Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria that made the corn resistant to some pests. In 1999, environmentalists were alarmed when it was reported that pollen from Bt corn could kill monarch butterfly larvae if corn pollen drifted onto milkweed plants that monarchs fed upon. Consumers feared the unknown and were concerned about potential food allergies. Presently, corn, along with soybeans, cotton, and canola dominate the GM food market. These crops are grown and distributed mostly in the United States, Argentina, Canada, Brazil, and China. They are used mostly for animal feed, clothing, or to make oil or other ingredients for processed food, which has helped them gain public acceptance. Although GM crops such as strawberries, potatoes, and lettuce have all been marketed in the United States, GM food field trials involving biotech fruits and vegetables have dropped significantly during the past several years, and the pace of new product introductions has fallen sharply. This narrow range of crops could mean that biotechnology may not realize its full potential in the future. Which of the following was a positive environmental aspect of the Flavr Savr tomato?

Five dialysis bags, constructed of a type of membrane that is permeable to water and impermeable to sucrose, were filled with various concentrations of sucrose and then placed in separate beakers containing an initial concentration of 0.6 M sucrose solution. At 10-minute intervals, the bags were massed (weighed), and the percent change in mass of each bag was graphed.    Which line or lines in the graph represent(s) bags that contain a solution that is hypertonic at 50 minutes?

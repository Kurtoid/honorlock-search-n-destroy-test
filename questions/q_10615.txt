11. (10 points, 8 minutes) (a) (2 points) In a 32-bit architecture (each memory word is 32-bits), how many memory words are needed to store an IP-address of the form a.b.c.d (where each of a, b, c, and d are decimal values between 0 and 255)?  Explain your answer. (b) The picture below shows the evolution of the link state algorithm for Node A.    The first row in the table is the initial knowledge that Node A has about its direct connectivity to its neighbors.  The notation 1/AC means it takes 1 unit of time for A to communicate to C. (i) (2 points) Explain how the elements of second row (iteration count = 1) get populated. (ii) (2 points) What is the invariant in the link state algorithm?   (c) The picture below shows the distance vector algorithm in action for Node E.  Each row in the table shows the cost and the route for reaching a particular node from E.  The notation 4(ECA) means it takes 4 units of time to reach node A from E through node C.    (i) (2 points) Explain the algorithmic action for E to choose the best route to choose for sending messages to D. (ii) (2 points) Once the routes have been determined, what causes node E to run the algorithm again?

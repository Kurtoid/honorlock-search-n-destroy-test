Imagine a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains information about a person who used to work for UMD. Each dictionary has the keys "name", "start", and "end". The value of "name" is a string; the value of "start" is the year the person started working at UMD, expressed as a four-digit integer; and the value of "end" is the year the person stopped working at UMD, expressed as a four-digit integer. Here is an example of a list of dictionaries matching this description: [ { "name": "Beverly Green", "start": 1979, "end": 2011 }, { "name": "Reginald Young", "start": 1984, "end": 2019 }, { "name": "Alice Lee", "start": 1993, "end": 1999 }] Write a function that takes a list of dictionaries like the one above as an argument. The function should return a list of names from the dictionaries, sorted in decreasing order of the person's years of service at UMD. For the example list above, the function would return ["Reginald Young", "Beverly Green", "Alice Lee"] because Mr. Young has 35 years of service (2019-1984), Ms. Green has 32 years of service (2011-1979), and Ms. Lee has 6 years of service (1999-1993). For full points, your solution should include a list comprehension and a lambda expression.

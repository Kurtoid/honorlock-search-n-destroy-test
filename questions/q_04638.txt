Q. 1 (40 pts) The basic operations of a fruit selling company is the following:  Production cost and restrictions: Each month the cost of production (harvesting and boxing) per unit fruit is ct for the next 5 months t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. At most ft units of fruits can be produced in month t for t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.     Demand: The demand for fruit in the next 5 months is dt for t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We must (at least) meet this demand, but can sell more than the demand. In month t, the selling price of the fruits for the first dt units is pt per unit fruit and the selling price of fruits sold beyond demand dt is 0.5pt per unit fruit.      Inventory and fruit juice: The company has inventory capacity of storing fruits. The cost of storing fruits is vt per unit fruit from month t to t + 1. All inventory left at the end of month 5 should be converted into juice and sold at j per unit. Each unit of fruit yields 0.7 units of juice.

Explain why an induction motor is operated with constant volts/hertz below the rated frequency and at constant voltage above the rated frequency. Explain why the induction motor cannot sustain "constant kVA" operation above its rated speed/frequency up to its mechanical limit. What is it that limits the constant kVA range? Which parameter of the machine would you choose to change to increase the constant kVA region. Explain. (X1+X2 counts as a single parameter) Why is it that the current can remain at the rated value in the constant kVA region. Why is the slip at peak torque very small for a motor operated with a constant current source?

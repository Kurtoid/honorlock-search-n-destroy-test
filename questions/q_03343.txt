(For graduate students enrolled in EGM5444) A rocket of mass M and moment of inertia I is constrained to move in a horizontal plane. Its thrust is directed such that its velocity is always directed toward a target which moves along the x-axis according to xtarget = a sin wt. A torque T about the center of mass controls the orientation of the craft. Ignore the physical dimensions of the rocket.  Find the constraint equation on the velocity in terms of the generalized coordinates x, y, and f. Find the coefficients of the Lagrange multiplier(s) for this constraint. Find the generalized forces associated with the coordinates x, y, and f for the force F and torque T. Find the equations of motion. If the orientation of the rocket is also directed straight at the target, what is the constraint equation? Without doing all the math, what steps need to be taken to apply the constraint equation to the Lagrange equations?

PP&E Leasing acquires equipment and leases it to customers under long-term sales-type leases. PP&E earns interest under these arrangements at a 6% annual rate. PP&E purchased a machine and then leased it for $300,000 under an arrangement that specified annual payments to be received for five years, beginning at the commencement of the lease. The lessee had the option to purchase the machine at the end of the lease term for $50,000 when it was expected to have a market value of $80,000. Calculate the amount of the annual lease payments. (Round your answer to the nearest whole dollar amount.)

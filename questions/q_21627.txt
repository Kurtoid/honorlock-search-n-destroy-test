Blanks #1 through #5: Complete hydrolysis of the lipid below gives which five molecules? List one molecule per blank. Describe specific fatty acids by their delta nomenclature (e.g. 18:2 delta 4, 7 fatty acid).   Blank #6: The unsaturated fatty acid is an omega        fatty acid Blank #7: Is this lipid likely to be part of the inner or outer leaflet of the plasma membrane?   In response to certain hormonal signals, phospholipase A2 hydrolyzes the unsaturated fatty acid (arachidonic acid) from the lipid above. Arachidonic acid then serves as a precursor to various eicosanoids. These include prostaglandins (such as PGE2, PGI2), thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and leukotriene A (see the diagram below).   Blank #8: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAID's) such as aspirin or ibuprofen reduce pain and inflammation, cause bleeding, but have no effect on smooth muscle contraction.

Probability is the likelihood that an event will happen and can be expressed in terms of percent. For example, in Fire Science, if there is a 40 percent chance of a spot fire starting, that means that out of 100 glowing embers that fly off, 40 embers will likely start spot fires, and 60 will not. The probability of ignition is [x]%. How many glowing firebrands landed on receptive fuel if there were 120 ignitions? Round your answer to the nearest ignition.

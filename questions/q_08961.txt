PTT every 6 hours until two (2) consecutive PTTs are therapeutic (46 to 70). Then change PTT to every 24 hours.  Stop Heparin infusion if platelet count is less than 100,000 or platelet count drops by 50% pre-Heparin level, and notify healthcare provider.   STEPS IN CALCULATING HEPARIN DOSAGE (INITIAL DOSAGE)  Change weight in pounds to kilograms.  Calculate IV Bolus Heparin at 80 units/kg (80 units per kg).

17. Of the four types of listening, which one means "listening for the artistry of a message"?
In the figure above, a solid disk of moment of inertia Id=0.0100 kg*m2 and radius R=10.0 cm, is rotating at 210 rev/min on a frictionless shaft. A hoop of moment of inertia Ih, inner radius R2=6.00 cm and outer radius R1=8.00 cm is initially at rest. It drops freely down onto the disk, and frictional forces bring the hoop and the disk to a common rotational speed of 70.0 rev/min.  What is the moment of inertia of the hoop, Ih?

One economist, writing about the twenty-five years following World War II, put it simply by saying that this was a 'quarter century of sustained growth at the highest rates in recorded history.' Former Prime Minister Edward Heath of Great Britain agreed, observing that the United States at the time was enjoying 'the greatest prosperity the world has ever known.'" James T.

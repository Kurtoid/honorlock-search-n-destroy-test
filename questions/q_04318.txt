You need to control the number of people who can be in a bar at the same time. Groups of people can always leave the bar, but a group cannot enter the bar if they would make the number of people in the bar exceed the maximum of 100 occupants (variable: int maxOcc). Write a method that, given the sizes of the groups that arrive (variable: int groupSize), determines whether the groups can enter the bar.  If the group can enter the bar, print a message saying, "Welcome!", and end the program. If the group is too large but the bar is not at full capacity (i.e., there are not 100 people in the bar but letting the group in would then exceed the maximum capacity), print a message saying, "The bar is very popular. Please wait." and,  if the group has waited less than 3 times, check the bar capacity again to see if there is room for the group (end the program should the group go through 3 checks without getting in the bar).   As soon as the bar holds the maximum number of people, report that the bar is full and print a message saying "Sorry, the bar is completely full" and end the program.  Write your method in Java. Your method must receive the int variable groupSize as a parameter, int maxOcc already exists as an instance variable in the class, and any libraries are already imported.  Do NOT concern yourself with any code regarding people leaving the bar. Just assume that is taken care of. (20pts) Your  method:

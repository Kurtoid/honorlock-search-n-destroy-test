Your client is considering the construction of a transfer station.  Currently they haul 1200 tons of waste per day (on average) in 24 yd3 garbage trucks to a landfill.  If this build a transfer station, they could haul their waste in 100 yd3 transfer trailers.  The density of waste in a garbage truck is 600 lb/yd3 on average, while the density of waste in a transfer trailer will be 800 lb/yd3.   The fuel efficiency of the current garbage trucks is 8 miles per gallon and the fuel efficiency of a transfer trailer hauled by a semi-truck is 5 miles per gallon; the cost of fuel is $2.75/gallon.  The non-fuel cost associated with a garbage truck is $0.75/mile and the non-fuel cost associated with a transfer trailer is $1.40/mile. The daily cost to build/operate a transfer station is $4,200/day. B) If the cost of fuel were to double, what is the break-even distance (one way)?

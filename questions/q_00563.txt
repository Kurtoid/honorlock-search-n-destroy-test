In Spanish describe how your daily routine changes when you get sick.  Talk about how your life is affected when you don't feel good. Use as many reflexive verbs as possible.  Some things to consider (do not just answer these questions in a list though):   Are your sleeping patterns different when you're sick?  Do you go to the doctor or do you just try to manage the illness on your own? Do you eat different foods when you are sick? Does someone take care of you?  How does being sick affect your hygiene habits?   Useful vocabulary (you don't HAVE to use these):  normalmente - normally usualmente - usually cuando - when (if not being used as a question) la sopa - soup el agua - water comodo(a) - comfortable si - if (notice there is no accent like there is for the word "yes")  Reminder: You are NOT ALLOWED to use online translators of any type. If the use of a translator is suspected it will be dealt with as an academic dishonesty case which will result in a zero. If you need an accented letter or other special character in your answer, copy and paste the character you need from this list into the answer box: a e i o u u n A E I O U ! ?

Finding all decoded strings from a given input string that only consists of digit letters.  Implement a void function decodeWays function that decodes an input string, which consists of '0','1',..,'9', in all permissible ways.  [14 points]  The decodeWays has the following two parameters;   s: input string which consists of '0','1',..,'9'  and the first letter of s is not '0'  answer: an empty list   The decodeWays is a void function;  However, as a side-effect from the function, the answer must be filled with all the possible decoded strings in permissible ways in lexicographic order.      Explain the run-time and run-space complexity of the algorithm that you used for the implementation. [6 points]    Description    A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following: mapping:  'A' -> 1 'B' -> 2 ... 'Z' -> 26   Given a non-empty string containing only digits, find all the possible decoded strings.        Input Format    A string of digits.  Example input 1: s: "12"answer: [] Example input 2: s: "226"answer: []         Output    answer[] list which being filled with all permissible decoded strings.  For Example input "12": answer: ["AB", "L"] For Example input "226": answer: ["BBF", "BZ", "VF"]

Consider the functions f(x) = 2x and g(x) = 2x + 7x2. In the following questions, you may use the fact that x2 <= 2x for all x >= 4. (a) (3 points.) Is f(x) in O(g(x))? You must prove or disprove your claim using the definition of big-O shown in the class videos (that is, you must use the definition with witnesses C and k, no calculus). (b) (5 points.) Is g(x) in O(f(x))? You must prove or disprove your claim using the definition of big-O shown in the class videos (that is, you must use the definition with witnesses C and k, no calculus). (c) (2 points.) Use your answers to parts (a) and (b) to state whether f(x) is Th(g(x)).

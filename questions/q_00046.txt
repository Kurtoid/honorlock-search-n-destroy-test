Question 18 - 20 refers to the excerpt below. "I am forty-nine years old. It took me years of considerable anguish to get where I am. . . . I was nurtured in the Depression; I lost four years to war; I have had one coronary; I am a 'liberal,' a square and a professor of history. "As such, I am supposed to have 'liaison' with the young. But the fact is that I am fed up with hippies, Yippies, militants and nonsense. . . . "Every generation makes mistakes, always has and always will. We have made our share. But my generation has made America the most affluent country on earth; it has tackled, head-on, a racial problem which no nation on earth in the history of mankind had dared to do. It has publicly declared war on poverty and it has gone to the moon; it has desegregated schools and abolished polio. . . . "I assert that we are [in] trouble with this younger generation not because we have failed our country, not because of affluence or stupidity, . . . not because we are middle-class materialists, but simply because we have failed to keep that generation in its place. . . . "To the extent that we now rely on the police, mace, the National Guard, tear gas, steel fences and a wringing of hands, we will fail. What we need is a reappraisal of our own middle-class selves, our worth and our hard-won progress. We need to use disdain, not mace; we need to reassess a weapon we came by the hard way--firm authority as parents, teachers, businessmen, workers and politicians."

TransWorld Communications Inc., a large telecommunications company, is evaluating the possible acquisition of Georgia Cable Company (GCC), a regional cable company. TransWorld's analysts project the following post-merger data for GCC (in thousands of dollars):             2009   2010   2011   2012     FCF       $  61.4   $  69.7   $  71.7   $  74.8     Tax rate after merger   35%                     Capital structure after merger   50% Debt                     Beta before merger   1.4                     Tax rate before merger   20%                     Capital structure before merger   40% Debt                     Risk-free rate   8%                     Market risk premium   4%                     Terminal growth rate of cash flow available to TransWorld   7%                     If the acquisition is made, it will occur on January 1, 2009. All cash flows shown in the income statements are assumed to occur at the end of the year. GCC currently has a capital structure of 40% debt, but TransWorld would increase that to 50% if the acquisition were made. GCC, if independent, would pay taxes at 20%; but its income would be taxed at 35% if it were consolidated. GCC's current market-determined beta is 1.40, and itsinvestment bankers think that its beta would rise, if the debt ratio were increased to 50%. The risk-free rate is 8%, and the market risk premium is 4%. Please answer the following two questions: (1) What is the proper discount rate for valuing this acquisition?

Use the following information for questions 21 through 24. Clothes, Inc., has an average annual demand for medium polo shirts of 18,000 units. The cost of placing an order is $90 and the cost of carrying one unit in inventory for one year is $25. The stockout cost is $5 per unit. We assume there are 360 days per year. Demand for every 6 days may vary with the following probability distribution:                                                                             Demand for 6 days:   240 units   300 units   360 units     Probability (sums to 1.00):   0.15   0.7   0.15

Force on moving charges: A uniform magnetic field of magnitude 0.80 T in the negative z direction is present in a region of space, as shown in the figure. A uniform electric field is also present and is set at 76,000 V/m in the +y direction. An electron is projected with an initial velocity v0 = 9.5 x 104 m/s in the +x direction. The y component of the initial force on the electron is closest to which of the following quantities? (e = 1.60 x 10-19 C)

The amount of money collected by a snack bar at a large university has been recorded daily for the past 5 years. Records indicate that the mean daily amount collected is $3900 and the standard deviation is $600. The distribution is skewed to the right due to several high volume days (like football game days). Suppose that 100 days were randomly selected from the five years and the average amount collected from those days was recorded. Which of the following describes the sampling distribution of the sample mean?

His tax basis in ABC at the beginning of ABC's most recent tax year was $10,000. Comparing the Schedule K-1 he recently received from ABC with the Schedule K-1 he received from ABC last year, Clint noted that his share of ABC partnership debt changes as follows: recourse debt increased from $0 to $2,000, qualified nonrecourse debt increased from $0 to $3,000, and  nonrecourse debt increased from $0 to $3,000. Finally, the Schedule K-1 Clint received from ABC reflected a $1,000 cash contribution he made to ABC during the year.

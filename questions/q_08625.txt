2.  Write out the pathway of glycolysis, as it occurs in a muscle cell. Begin with fructose (drawn for you) and end with lactate.  Write enzyme names below the arrows.  Write coreactants/byproducts above the arrows, when needed.  Do NOT name the structures.  (If you forgot the structures but remember the names, then you may substitute names for structures for a 5 point deduction.)  Please use one page of paper for this one and start following questions on different papers.  (20 pts)

In his transformation experiments, what did Griffith observe? A) Mixing a heat-killed pathogenic strain of bacteria with a living nonpathogenic strain can convert some of the living cells into the pathogenic form. B) Mixing a heat-killed nonpathogenic strain of bacteria with a living pathogenic strain makes the pathogenic strain nonpathogenic. C) Infecting mice with nonpathogenic strains of bacteria makes them resistant to pathogenic strains. D) Mice infected with a pathogenic strain of bacteria can spread the infection to other mice.

A botanist discovers a new species of plant in a tropical rain forest.  After observing its anatomy and life cycle, the following characteristics are noted:  flagellated sperm, xylem, megaphyllous leaves, separate gametophyte and sporophyte generations, and no seeds.

Coloration in the peppered moth (Biston betularia) is determined by a single gene with two alleles showing complete dominance. Dark moths are homozygous dominant or heterozygous for the gene, light moths are homozygous recessive. In a sample of 100 moths, you determine that 64 of the moths are dark. According to the Hardy-Weinberg rule, the expected frequency of the dominant allele is ________.

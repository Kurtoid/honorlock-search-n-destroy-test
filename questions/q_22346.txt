(25 pts) At one time, it was proposed that a total dislocation in a face centered cubic (FCC) can be decomposed into two asymmetric partial dislocations.  Points A, B, and C are the lattice points on the slip plane.  d lies in the center of line BC.   (a) If AB, BC, and AC represent the Burgers vectors of three total dislocations in this plane, please identify AB, BC, and AC with their proper Burgers vector expressed in the vector notation.  Note Burgers vector notation represents both direction and magnitude. (b) If Ad, dB, and dC represent the Burgers vectors of partial dislocations in this plane, please identify Ad, dB, and dC with their proper Burgers vector expressed in the vector notation. Note Burgers vector notation represents both direction and magnitude. (c) Please demonstrate AB=Ad+dB using Burger's vector calculation. (d) Please use the vector energy calculation and notations to determine whether this dislocation decomposition AB a Ad+dB is energy favorable or not.

During steady flow conditions, you have measured the following properties for flow through a [d] cm diameter straight, horizontal pipe,  Volume of fluid collected = [V] +- [ev] litres Time over which the data was collected = [t] +- [et] s Distance between the pressure ports = [L] m Pressure drop measured = [p] +- [ep] Pa  You are given the following: rwater = 1000 kg/m3, mwater = 0.001 N.s/m2, 1 litre = 0.001 m3.  Determine the average velocity through this pipe and whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. What is the friction factor for this pipe. Use the box below to answer this part.  Show all your work on the work upload (assumptions, schematics, analysis, etc.) document. Write down units in your equations. Solve symbolically and plug in numbers at the end.

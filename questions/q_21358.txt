Which of the following best describes the speaker's tone in the quote:  "Man overbold, lo, now again the deeds of war are in thy mind and the travail thereof. Wilt thou not yield thee even to the deathless gods?" RL 9-10.4
A local car dealer advertises that all their cars cost on average $30,000.  You, as a responsible consumer and inquisitive individual, decide to test their claim.  You reviewed 40 car sales from a recent week and found the mean cost was $31,000 and had a standard deviation of $4000.   Write the claim, the null and alternative hypothesis proposed by the car dealer in symbolic form.  Claim:   Null Hypothesis:   Alternative Hypothesis:    Calculate the appropriate test statistics. Show all work to receive credit and be sure to label your calculation with the appropriate symbolism. Based on your analysis, what is your conclusion regarding the car dealers claim? Explain.

Problem 5: Finite State Machine (FSM) Write a System Verilog module (named prob5) that implements the Finite machine in this state table. Use good code organization and indentation for full credit. Your code should be efficient, with the minimum number of lines possible, and designed to compile, and synthesize without errors or warnings. Assume that this should be implemented as a standard Mealy Model. Inputs are clk, reset, x, outputs are State, and Z. Be specific about your answers to a) b) c) for full credit. (Use System Verilog, don't use datatype reg, use always_comb and always_ff as appropriate for always blocks, if needed.) Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables.  a)Write the System Verilog code for the module assignment and declarations, and use localparam to associate the state names and state values b) This is the Synchronous part of the code, for full credit do this by instantiating the D Register from problem 4). (If you can't do it that way, you can get some credit for a procedural approach.) c) This is the combinatorial part of the code, for full credit do this by instantiating the multiplexer from the problem 1) as many times as you need. (If you can't do it that way, you can get some credit for a procedural approach.) The result of parts a), b) and c) should be complete FSM code using the modules from the last problem.

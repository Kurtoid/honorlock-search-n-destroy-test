Using the T-T-T shown below and ,                   (a) Determine the microstructure of a 0.77 wt % C-steel that has the following heat treatment:                                 (i) instantly quenched to 500degC from 727degC.                                 (ii) held for 4 s.                                 (iii) quenched instantly to room temperature.

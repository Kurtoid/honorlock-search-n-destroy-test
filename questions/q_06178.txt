Birth weight  A baby is said to have a low birth-weight when they weigh less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces (2,500 grams). About 8.3% of all U.S. babies born fall into this category.  The mean birth-weight for babies born in the U.S. is about 3,500 grams. Assuming birth-weights are normally distributed, estimate the standard deviation of birth-weights given this information. Suppose the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services wants to change the definition of low birth-weight to include only the lowest 5% of birth-weights. What would be the new definition of a low birth-weight baby? Use the standard deviation you calculated.

The rigid bar shown is supported by link AB and the pinned support at C (its connection detail is shown). Pins A and B are in single shear.  All pins have a diameter of  1/2 ", member AB is 1.5" wide x  1/2 " thick, the rigid bar is 2" wide x  1/2 " thick, and the gusset plates supporting pin C are  1/4 " thick.  All of the components are made of the same material whose failure normal stress is 60 ksi, failure shear stress is 54 ksi, and failure bearing stress is 56 ksi.  Using a factor of safety of 1.8, determine the maximum force P that may be safely supported, considering only the following failure modes:  Tensile failure of link AB. Shear failure of pin C.

The Following Problem will be referenced in the Flowchart Problem and the Coding Problem PROBLEM: Speed at a given time t is equal to  (v0 * t) + 1/2(a*(t^2)), where v0 is the initial velocity and a is the acceleration.  Assume that the acceleration is 9.8.  v0 is a floating-point number and t is a whole number; define a as a constant floating-point number.  Write a program that asks the user for the initial velocity of an object and the elapsed time time t and calculates the speed.          Define your variables  Ask the user to enter the initial velocity v0 and time.   If time is 0 or less, output the message "Invalid Time" and end the program.  If v0 is less than 0, output the message "Invalid Initial Velocity" and end the program.  Otherwise, do the following:   Compute the speed using the formula: s = (v0*t) + 1/2(a*(t^2)) (obviously you need to convert this to C++ code and that may take several separate statements)    Display the result to the screen using 2 columns: a label  in the first column and in the second printing the number using exactly 4 decimal places. (use setw to define the columns)     Using the conventions discussed in class, create a flowchart to model the solution to the problem (use diagrams.net).  Download the flowchart to your computer as a pdf and then submit that flowchart file below.

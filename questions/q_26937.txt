When a displaced air parcel tends to return to its point of origin, the atmosphere is generally said to be:
A distribution of point charges is placed on the coordinate system shown below. The axis is marked in meters. Assume the potential infinitely far from the origin is zero.   a) Calculate the electric potential due to the distribution of charges at point P, which is located at the origin. b) Find the electric potential at r= 8mi+4mj (8m, 4m) labeled as P' in the figure. c) A charge qc = -1.965x10-3 C is placed at the origin and is moved infinitely far away. What is the change in potential energy for qc. d) First of all, qc is removed from the origin. Then a charge of qd=8.65x10-7 C is placed at P'. What is the change in potential energy in moving this charge to the origin? part a) V1 =-3.182 x107 V V2 =1.659x107 V V3 =5.529 x106 V 6. Find the net electric potential at the origin. Write your answer in scientific notation, and enter the coefficient, rounding to 3 decimal places. Do not include units, and put a minus sign if negative. VP =         x106 V

Which of the following events is considered the climax of "A Good Man is Hard to Find"?
Here are the authors conclusions from the Cochrane Review, "Acupuncture for preventing migraine attacks" the team reviewed 22 trials with 4985 people, published up to January 2016.  https://www.cochrane.org/CD001218/SYMPT_acupuncture-preventing-migraine-attacks  The available evidence suggests that adding acupuncture to symptomatic treatment of attacks reduces the frequency of headaches. Contrary to the previous findings, the updated evidence also suggests that there is an effect over sham (fake acupuncture procedures), but this effect is small. The available trials also suggest that acupuncture may be at least similarly effective as treatment with prophylactic drugs. Acupuncture can be considered a treatment option for patients willing to undergo this treatment. As for other migraine treatments, long-term studies, more than one year in duration, are lacking. How would you describe the strength of this evidence?

A turbine, with a diameter of   [D] m, is shown to the right. It rotates about its center and P is a point located on the tip of a fan blade. The turbine rotates at a constant rate. If a sensor reports that the acceleration at point P is [arad] m/s2, determine the linear speed of point P.

Write a JavaFX GUI program with file name LastnameFirstnameExam5.java that meets the following requirements and adheres to the layout included sketch.  Must set the title of the window to be "1331 Exam 5 - YOURNAME", where YOURNAME is replaced with your first and last name. Must include some non-editable text at the top to the window (not the title) with a short phrase of your choosing. Change the text font to either Georgia, Papyrus, Courier New, or Comic Sans MS; it cannot be the default font. Font size should be 12. Must include a plain Button.  The button must toggle the color of the short phrase between Color.BLACK and your favorite color.  Make sure this color is still visible in the UI (i.e. the color should be dark enough to be seen). You must set the button text to something of your choosing.   Must include one of the following shapes:  Circle, Rectangle, Polygon, Ellipse, or Arc. The shape can be a color of your choosing, but make sure this color is still visible in the UI (i.e. the color should be dark enough to be seen). Must include a select one-of-many button group to control the alignment of the shape displayed. There should be 3 alignment options for Top, Center, and Bottom.  Hint: StackPane has a setAlignment method. You may place this group beside or below the shape.  In order to actually see the alignment change you will need to ensure that your window/stage is large enough. So, you need to set the size of your stage to be large enough to see the change proportional to the the size of your shape. A good ratio is to make the window 3 times the width and height of the Shape. To do this you can use the following methods: stage.setMinWidth(X); and stage.setMinHeight(Y);   Must use a Slider UI control that will control the opacity of the shape.  The Slider's major tick labels should be displayed (setShowTickLabels) The Slider should have a minimum value of 0.0, maximum value of 1.0, and initial value of 1.0 Hint: Opacity is specified as a value between 0.0 (completely transparent) and 1.0 (completely opaque). Another Hint: Look closely at Slider's constructors to find one that allows for configuration of the min/max/init values on creation of the Slider to make your life easier. Yet Another Hint: There are several ways to implement the event handling, we recommend using the setOnMouseReleased method that is available to any Node   You must use at least one of the following children of Pane to control the layout of the Nodes: BorderPane, GridPane, HBox, or VBox. You must implement your event handling at least two of the three ways we taught: named inner class, anonymous inner class, and lambda expression.  For example, at least one handler as an anonymous inner class and at least one handler as a lambda expression. Failure to implement handlers in two different ways will result in the loss of points.   Points may be deducted if your layout deviates greatly from the one shown below. However, you do not need to have a border around the pane containing your shape nor around the shape itself. You may place the one-of-many button group below or beside the Shape.  YOUR SHOULD ONLY SUBMIT A SINGLE JAVA FILE. ENSURE THAT ANY OTHER CLASSES YOU INCLUDE EXIST WITHIN THE SAME FILE. IF YOUR SUBMITTED CODE DOES NOT COMPILE, YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO. SAVE, BACKUP, AND TEST OFTEN! The following is an example layout for your UI, but as long as you meet the requirements stated above the layout is flexible:
"                          check" is used to determine the effectiveness of a                             in an experimental design to make sure that it does produce differences in the independent variable. (Choose the correct answer)
Problems                Prepare the problems below using Excel. Upload the workbook using the link.            1. (12 points) Kawhi Corporation is a wholesaler of industrial goods. Data regarding the store's operations follow:             * Sales are budgeted at $332,000 for November, $364,000 for December and $314,000 for January.              * Cash sales are expected to be 40% of sales, and credit sales are expected to be 60% of sales. Collections of credit sales are expected to be 52% in the month of sale, 46% in the month following the sale, and 2% uncollectible.              * The cost of goods sold is 75% of sales.              * The company purchases 55% of its merchandise in the month prior to the month of sale and 45% in the month of sale without regard to beginning or ending merchandise inventory. Payment for merchandise is made in the month following the purchase.               * The November beginning balance in the accounts receivable account is $84,200.             Required:             a. Prepare a Schedule of Expected Cash Collections for November and December.             b. Prepare a Merchandise Purchases Budget for November and December.                     2. (12 points) A sales budget is given below for one of the products manufactured by the Locke Co.:                 Sales Budget          in Units        January 24,000        February 52,000        March 66,000        April 54,000        May 38,000        June 28,000              The inventory of finished goods at the end of each month must equal 35% of the next month's sales. On December 31, the finished goods inventory totaled 4,600 units.                Each unit of product requires five specialized electrical switches. The company has a policy of maintaining an ending inventory at the end of each month equal to 15% of the next month's production needs. This requirement had been met on January 1 of the current year. Each switch costs $4.25.               Required:                 Prepare a budget showing the cost of switches to be purchased each month for January, February, and March and in total for the quarter. (Note: both a production budget and direct materials budget will need to be prepared.)

Directions: Read the following passage, analyze the graphs, and then answer the questions that follow.  Population Growth and Damage from Hurricanes The East Coast of the United States has attracted millions of new residents and vacationers over the past several decades.  There are now almost 50 million people who live year-round on shorelines from Texas to Maine, especially in the Sunbelt (from Texas through North Carolina).  The East Coast is also in the path of many hurricanes, and the increase in population has led not only to more costly damage when hurricanes strike, as shown in the graphs below, but also to problems evacuating people.  The development of new roads along the shoreline has not kept pace with population growth, making evacuation difficult.  In addition, there have been fewer serious hurricanes since 1980 than there were in the previous three decades, so many people do not take hurricane warnings seriously enough and may delay leaving in an evacuation.

4.  As discussed in class, Beck's Depression Inventory is an assessment tool that is designed to measure the severity of symptoms of clinical depression.

Some of these psychiatrists determined that a few of the questions are really evaluating aspects of anxiety and not depression.  As a result, these questions were altered to focus on depression symptoms.  This process is known as strengthening which test worthiness factor?
Please briefly answer the next two questions based on the case below: ABC Company is a large manufacturer of low price agricultural machinery and is known as having a family-like organizational culture. However, due to the economic recession, demands for its products have been down.

Question 1: Based on what you have learned from this course, please suggest one specific performance appraisal measure that can help the top management team make the change.

Project: HOPE Design  a 7-segment decoder that determines two-bit logical input (using the switches on the BASYS 3 trainer board), and generates output on the 7-segment display as shown in the following table:    7-segment Display S(1) S(0)    0 0    0 1    1 0    1 1       If both switches are OFF, the 7-segment has to display capital letter 'H'. If the switch S(0) is ON and S(1) is OFF, the 7-segment has to display capital letter 'O'. If the switch S(0) is OFF and S(1) is ON, the 7-segment has to display capital letter 'P'. If both switches are ON, the 7-segment has to display capital letter 'E'.  To achieve this, you have to derive the Boolean expression for each segment of the 7-segment display: a, b, c, d, e, f, and g by using the method of your choice (Karnaugh map, minterm or maxterm).  The 7-segment display on BASYS 3 board is active low, meaning...  logical output 0 will turn ON the LED of that segment,  logical output 1 will turn OFF the LED of that segment,  For example,    7-segment Display a b c d e f g    0 0 0 0 0 0 0    1 0 0 1 1 1 1    0 0 0 0 1 0 0    Directions:  Complete the truth table in question 1. Derive the Boolean expression for each segment and answer question 2. Implement your design on BASYS 3 Board using Xilinx Vivado with VHDL language.  Take photos of your result and upload them to question 5.

Read the poem (used for all poetry questions) and answer the question that follows. My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130) By: William Shakespeare 1 My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; 2 Coral is far more red than her lips' red; 3 If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; 4 If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. 5 I have seen roses damasked, red and white, 6 But no such roses see I in her cheeks; 7 And in some perfumes is there more delight 8 Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. 9 I love to hear her speak, yet well I know 10 That music hath a far more pleasing sound; 11 I grant I never saw a goddess go; 12 My mistress when she walks treads on the ground. 13     And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare 14     As any she belied with false compare.

Your patient is receiving a continuous aminophylline infusion.  The bag reads 500 mg aminophylline in 250 ml D5W.  The pump is set at 20 ml/hour.  The labs reveal that the aminophylline levels are too high and the provider would like the drip reduced by 4 mg/hour.  At what rate would you set the pump?     ___________ ml/hour

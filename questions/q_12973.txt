ESSAY QUESTION NO. 1   (45 percent of the basic course grade.  Recommended time:  90 minutes.)            An aging and childless couple owned a wheat farm in one of the states located on the Great Plains.  They lived in a small house in a nearby town, and they drove to the farm each day to tend to its operations.  Although the couple knew that they would someday need to sell the farm and retire to their house in town, a sudden deterioration in their health forced their hand.  They needed to give up the physical labor that the farm required.  The couple had already planted the next year's crop when they received their medical diagnoses.            Fortunately, there was someone in town who was interested in buying the farm.  The purchaser had grown up in the area, had studied agricultural sciences in college, and had worked for five years on another wheat farm close by.  The couple and the purchaser agreed on a price for the farm, and the purchaser was able to line up financing for the purchase from the bank in town.            The purchase and sale agreement for the farm provided that the sale included two contracts that related to the farm's operations.  The first was a wheat purchase agreement.  The wheat purchase agreement sold the farm's crop in advance of its harvest at a stated price to a wheat buyer in town.  The couple's principal purpose in entering into the contract was to fix the price of their harvested wheat so they wouldn't be subject to fluctuations in the market price of wheat between the time of planting and the time of harvest.  The price set in the contract also gave the couple a way to measure their loss in the event that their crop was destroyed by bad weather.  If the farm suffered a shortfall in its harvest, the wheat purchase agreement provided that the couple would pay the wheat purchaser for the shortfall.            The second contract was a crop insurance policy.  Crop insurance was important to farming operations on the Great Plains given the region's random severe weather, including the occasional severe drought, that could destroy a crop.  In the event that extreme weather destroyed their wheat crop, the couple would be able to use the crop insurance to pay what they owed under the wheat purchase agreement.            The couple knew from their insurance agent in town that several other farming families used wheat purchase agreements and crop insurance to protect themselves from market swings and severe weather.  However, there were other farmers who declined both forms of protection, willing to take on risk to avoid the expense of crop insurance premiums and to gain the benefit of any increase in the market price of wheat.            In anticipation of the sale of their farm, the couple spoke with their insurance agent to see whether there would be any problem with their crop insurance policy transferring over to the farm's new owner.  The agent listened to their plans and thought that the couple would benefit from an annuity contract.  The agent explained that the couple could purchase the annuity contract with the money they received for their farm, and the contract would pay them a monthly amount for as long as they lived; they couldn't outlive their savings.            The agent believed that the insurance company would agree to the transfer of the insurance policy to the new owner of the farm, especially if the couple were agreeable to buying their annuity contract from the insurance company.  The agent would point out to the insurance company that the policy would continue to cover the same farming operation, just with a new owner.            The following week, the agent called the couple and let them know that the insurance company had in fact agreed to the transfer of the farm's insurance policy to the new owner given that the couple would be purchasing an annuity contract from the company.  The couple passed the word on to the buyer-to-be, without mentioning their plan to purchase an annuity contract.  The couple and the new owner signed the documents for the sale and purchase of the farm, and the new owner took over the farm's operation.  Shortly afterwards, the couple purchased their annuity contract.             A month later, a drought set in and became increasingly more severe.  By the time the farm's wheat crop would usually have been ready for harvest, the farm's entire wheat crop had failed.  The new owner filed a claim under the farm's insurance policy for the loss and notified the purchaser under the wheat purchase agreement that there was no wheat to purchase.              The wheat purchaser agreed with the new owner that the wheat purchaser would take the amount paid by the insurance company in full payment of the amount that the new owner owed under the wheat purchase agreement.  The wheat purchaser arguably was entitled to more, because the shortage of wheat caused by the drought had driven up the market price of wheat substantially.  The wheat purchaser was willing to settle for less in order to maintain good relations with the new owner and the other farmers in the region; the wheat purchaser wanted to do business with the farmers in the future.  Accordingly, the new owner sent a letter to the insurance company via the insurance agent in town directing the insurance company to pay the claim for the lost crop directly to the wheat purchaser.            The farm's crop had failed once before.  Ten years previously, a serious drought had destroyed the crop.  The couple had a crop insurance policy from the same company, and the company paid the claim promptly and in full.            But this time, things were different:  the insurance company denied the claim.  In a letter to the farm's new owner, the insurance company wrote that the new owner was mistaken in thinking that they had a policy with the insurance company; the policy referred to in the claim was owned by someone else.  In addition, the loss of the crop wasn't covered by the policy because no extreme drought had occurred within the definition of the policy.  The new owner shared the insurance company's letter with the wheat purchaser.  The insurance company had also denied the claims of the wheat purchaser's other growers in the area.            The wheat purchaser has now turned to the attorney in town for whom you are clerking during the summer after your first year of law school.  The wheat purchaser has asked for legal advice from the attorney about a possible suit against the insurance company to collect on the farm's insurance policy.  The attorney has asked you to review the materials dropped off by the wheat purchaser and to give the attorney your analysis of the client's position, limiting your analysis to contract law.  The materials consist of copies of the insurance policy, the wheat purchase agreement, and notes made by the selling couple of the conversations they had with the insurance agent in town at the time they lined up the current insurance policy for the farm.  You are also familiar with the facts of the situation.            The insurance policy included the following provisions:            "2.3 Covered Loss in the Event of Drought.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Insured for a Substantial Crop Loss caused by an Extreme Drought.  A "Substantial Crop Loss" is defined as the loss of thirty-five percent or more, as measured in bushels or by weight, of the average crop of the previous five years.  An "Extreme Drought" is defined as a shortfall greater than 75 percent in the year's precipitation compared to the average annual rainfall during the past 25 years according to the records for the county kept by the US government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.            "9.1 Assignments.  This Agreement may not be assigned by either the Company or the Insured without the prior written consent of the Company.              "9.2 Additional Insureds.  In its discretion, the Company may pay any claim filed by the Insured to a lender or other creditor of the Insured.            "9.3 Amendment of the Agreement.  This Agreement may be amended only in writing and only by a writing signed by the Company.            "9.4 Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement is binding on the successors and assignees of the Insured.            "9.5 Entire Agreement.  This writing embodies the entire agreement between the Company and the Insured.  No terms not stated in this writing shall be deemed to be a part of the agreement between the Company and the Insured."            The wheat purchase agreement included the following provisions:            "5.2 Shortfall in Harvest.  In the event that the Seller's wheat harvest falls short of the Minimum Amount defined elsewhere in this Agreement, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser for each missing bushel of wheat the market price of wheat established on the Chicago market for immediate delivery on the Delivery Date as defined elsewhere in this Agreement.  The Purchaser may elect to apply such payment as a credit against the purchase price of the remaining wheat.            "5.3 Assignment of Insurance Proceeds.  By signing this Agreement, the Seller assigns to the Purchaser its right to payment under any crop insurance policy for the Crop as defined elsewhere in this Agreement, up to the amount the Seller owes under Section 5.2."            The notes made by the couple at the time they took out the current policy included the following:   "Annual premium goes up by 5 percent, but coverage expanded to include less severe droughts than 2010-11."            Essay Question No. 1:  Write a memorandum to the attorney giving your analysis of the wheat purchaser's position regarding the claim under the farm's insurance policy for the lost crop, limiting your analysis to contract law.

Parisian Pledges In 2015, delegates from 196 nations met in Paris to negotiate a deal that would reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and prevent Earth from warning by more than 2degC before 2100. The resulting agreement, called the Paris Accord, contains a pledge by each country to limit emissions by 2035. The pledges differ between developing countries and developed countries. A public document lists the specific pledge made by each country. To comply with the pledge made by the USA, President Obama signed the Clean Power Act, which would put his country on a course to reduce its emissions by 40% before 2035. People objecting to this act filed a lawsuit in the United States, arguing that President Obama abused his executive power. The Supreme Court heard the case and decided that each state could determine the rules by which it contributes its fair share of reductions.     Use this information and your knowledge about biology to answer questions 35-40.   36. Since pledges to reduce emissions appeared in a public document, each country was more likely to pledge a fair share of reductions.

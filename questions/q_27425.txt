The Beatles created over 240 songs; they recorded many singles and albums and made films and TV shows. Thousands of memorable pictures popularized their image. They learned from many world cultures, absorbed from various styles, and created their own. Their cross-style compositions covered a range of influences from English folk ballads to Indian raga, absorbing from Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Pvotr Ilvich Tchaikovsky, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Elvis Presley, Everly Brothers, Little Richard, and others. The songwriting and performing talents of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr fused in the Beatles' music. The Beatles Anthology TV documentary was watched by 420 million people in 1995 (IMDb Mini Biography By: Steve Shelokhonov).

Problem 4c) FSM combinatorial part Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner. The tool bar has indent functions.  In problem 4c) write the Combinatorial code for this FSM using the state transition table defined below continuing the code from 4a) and 4b) A state transition table (which contains the same information as a state diagram) is supplied, below. This should be done by instantiating the 4:1 multiplexer from problem 1 caseMUX41 for nextstate and for Z. For maximum credit your code should carefully follow the specification, and your grade will depend that. Use the minimum number of lines to accomplish this specification. Use System Verilog, always_ff, and always_comb, and don't use reg datatype. Also use proper indentation for organization.

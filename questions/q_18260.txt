Last year, Laura assigned a paid-up whole life insurance policy to an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT) for the benefit of her three children. The ILIT contained a Crummey provision for the benefit of each child. At the time of the transfer, the whole life insurance policy was valued at $200,000, and since Laura had not made any other taxable gifts during her lifetime, she did not owe any gift tax.

Traditional ML relies on manual feature engineering while modern DL operates on unstructured data.   Florida Museum of Natural History Pottery  sherds (fragments shown right) from the Swift Creek Pottery collection are reassembled (left) by matching imprints left behind by wooden paddles that were pressed into the surface (bottom right). These uniquely identify the artist and subsequently the geographic origin of pots. In Questions 1 - 3  a  classification task uses multiple  shape and image-based features (color, curvature)  and logistic regression to match fragments. Features are computed on small patches extracted from images of the sherds . The input is a vector of floats of feature correspondences (differences between pairs of patch features). Each vector is associated with a hand label 1 or 0 (match or non-match). The classifier produces a number between 0 and 1.

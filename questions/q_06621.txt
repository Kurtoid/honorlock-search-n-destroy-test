On a playground, a father pushes tangentially on a hand-driven merry-go-round with his two children on it, accelerating it to 24 rpm in 20 s. Assume that the merry-go-round is a disk with radius 3 m and has a mass of 798 kg. The two children, each with a mass of 25 kg, sit opposite each other on the edge of the merry-go-round. Calculate the required torque to produce the acceleration, neglecting frictional torque. (Hint: The moment of inertia of a disk is )

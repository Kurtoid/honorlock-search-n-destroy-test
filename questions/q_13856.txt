The basestation is connected back to the master switching center using a point to point microwave link. The link operates at 10.7 GHz and uses a 2W transmitter and a 30 dB gain antenna with 1 dB of line and connector loss for a total EIRP of 62 dBm. The link is designed using free space loss. If the switch is 10 km away, what will be the free space path loss for this link? Assume there are no hills in between the switch and the basestation. Express your answer in dB. Show work The switch uses another 30 dB gain antenna to receive the signal from the basestation described above. There is 1 dB of line and connector loss connecting the antenna to the receiver input. What will be the signal strength at the receiver input? (Assume free space loss as computed above) Show work

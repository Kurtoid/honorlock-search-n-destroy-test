Short Answers (50 points) Please answer questions concisely and write clearly. A 37-year old male was admitted to the hospital due to muscle pain and weakness. He reported occasional blurred vision, intermittent left wrist pain, and a slight tremor during the previous year. 3 month prior to the admission, he was diagnosed with gynecomastia (enlargement or swelling of breast tissue in males), and muscle pain and weight loss has started during the previous month. Upon admission to the emergency room, his pulse and blood pressure were elevated (100 beats per minute and 166/72 mm Hg, respectively). The patient was unable to stand; strength in the muscles of flexion and extension measured 3 out of 5 at the hips and knees and 4 out of 5 at the ankles and elbows. The predominantly proximal deficits in muscle power and the lack of deep-tendon reflexes are consistent with a severe myopathy. Potassium chloride (120mmol, total) was administered orally and intravenously, with resolution of weakness. His symptoms and rapid resolution of weakness with potassium chloride confirms hypokalemia. The laboratory results from blood and urine is shown as below in Table 1.

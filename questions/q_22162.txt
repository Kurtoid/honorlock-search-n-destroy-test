The Campbell Company is evaluating the proposed acquisition of a new milling machine. The machine's base price is $54,000, and it would cost another $6,000 to modify it for special use. The machine falls into the MACRS 3-year class, and it would be sold after 3 years for $24,000. The machine would require an increase in net working capital (inventory) of $2,500. The milling machine would have no effect on revenues, but it is expected to save the firm $25,000 per year in before-tax operating costs, mainly labor. Campbell's marginal tax rate is 40%. MACRS allowance percentages are 0.33, 0.45, and 0.15 for Years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. What is the new project's NPV if the project's cost of capital is 6%?

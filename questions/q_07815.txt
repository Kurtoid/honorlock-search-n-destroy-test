Bits & People Inc., a personal computer company with a beta of 1.95, is looking to enter into the gaming industry, a new business for the firm. Nexon Corp and NCSoft Inc. are pure-play firms that operate solely in the gaming industry, who have betas of 0.7 and 0.6, respectively. Nexon and NCSoft both have a leverage ratio (debt/assets) of 50% and they are financing their debt with bonds, which are trading at YTMs of 8% and 7%, respectively. Bits & People plans to follow industry convention and finance its gaming division with 50% leverage. Nexon and NCSoft are firms of roughly equal size, and investors in the gaming industry require the average of their costs of capital as return on their investments. Bits & People is planning to launch its gaming division in stages. For the first stage, their investment will be $10 million today, and they expect the division to generate $1 million in free cash flow, on average amid some uncertainty, for the next 10 years. At the end of the 10th year, they will know whether the gaming business is a success for sure, and will decide whether to invest $20 million in the second stage. Before then, success is uncertain with a probability is 20%. If the first stage is a success, the second stage will generate $5 million, and if a failure, only $0.1 million thereafter forever (from year 11 and beyond). The risk free rate is 5% and the market risk premium is 7%. All firms face a tax rate of 25%. Should Bits & People invest in the first stage of the new gaming division? Why or why not?

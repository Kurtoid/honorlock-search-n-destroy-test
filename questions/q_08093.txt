A state statute forbids employers from discriminating on the basis of religion; however, an exception provides that established religions that employ persons to engage in charitable activities may be exempted from this rule. A new church was formed in the state. The church espoused a number of nontraditional views. When the church gained enough members to open a new meeting center, it advertised for janitorial and maintenance workers. A woman applied for a position and was told that she would be hired if she converted to the church's religion. The woman refused to do so and complained to the state human relations board. After investigating, the board concluded that the church was not an established religion and its beliefs were not plausible. It ruled that the religious exemption would not be applicable and ordered the church to hire the woman. Church officials filed an action in federal district court challenging the board's refusal to apply the exemption. How is the court likely to rule?

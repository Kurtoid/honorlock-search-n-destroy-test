An facultative anaerobic chemoheterotroph is grown in the absence of oxygen in rich media.  Its exponential growth is shown by line A.

If the organism in the absence of oxygen is moved to minimal media, its growth would mostly likely be represented by line [2].   If the organism were grown in media lacking any organic molecules, its growth would be represented by line [3].

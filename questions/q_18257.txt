Assume a closed economy, with no government, is described by the following production function:      Y=K.5L.5 The savings rate of the economy is s = .3 = 60% and capital depreciates at the rate of delta = .15 = 15% There is no population growth or technological progress (n = g = 0).   a) Calculate the steady-state level of capital per worker (k), output per worker (y), consumption per worker (c), and investment per worker (i). b) Calculate the golden rule level of savings. If the savings rate were to increase, describe how this would affect k*, y*, and c* in the new steady-state equilibrium relative to the previous steady-state equilibrium in part (a).

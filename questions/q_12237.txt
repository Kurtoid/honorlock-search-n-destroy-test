A 2 kg box is against a vertical wall by a small force (F1 = 10N) perpendicular to the surface of the wall, and pushed upward by a Force, Fapp applied to the box vertically. The Force pushes the box up the wall at a constant velocity. There is a coefficient of kinetic friction uk= 0.3 between the box and the wall.  A. Choosing up and to the right as your positive direction, DESCRIBE your force body diagram for the block.   B Determine the value of the applied Force (Fapp) to keep the box moving upward at a constant velocity.

23. A 67 year-old man is evaluated in the emergency department for the acute onset of severe diffuse abdominal pain that began 2 days ago. His pain initially presented as intermittent but progressively became more consistent over the last 4 hours. Past medical history is significant for coronary artery disease, having undergone a three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery 5 years ago. Current medications are simvastatin, ramipril, metoprolol, and aspirin. On physical examination, temperature is 37.2degC (98.9degF), blood pressure is 72/54 mm Hg, pulse rate is 145/min, and respiration rate is 33/min. Abdominal examination discloses diffuse mild abdominal tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound and no masses. Laboratory studies reveal a leukocyte count of 13,500/uL (normal, 4000-10,000/mL). Computed tomographic scan of the abdomen shows thickening of the small bowel wall and air within the wall of the intestine. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

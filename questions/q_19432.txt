The process for manufacturing units for bat communities is labor intensive and requires tremendous attention to detail (it is hard to meet all the needs of 500,000 future residents).  In fact, it can take months and months for Gator Houses to complete just one bat house.  Consequently, Gator Houses has developed an in-house legal team (no pun intended) that is very good at writing sales contracts that protect Gator's financial interests throughout its manufacturing cycle.  Gator Houses' in-house accounting team, however, is struggling. Just last month, Gator showed up to ACG 5815 Headquarters and desperately asked for the professional accounting services of the Florida Gators for its fiscal year 2019 (calendar year).  First and foremost, Gator Houses needs help accounting for its biggest sales order to date.  On Friday, April 13, 2018, Gator executed a contract with a local Gainesville resident, Dr. Acula, to build the world's largest bat house for a fixed price of $10 million.  Gator originally estimated that a house of this magnitude would cost $1 million to build and the house would not possibly be stable enough to leave Gator Houses' construction warehouse until it was fully constructed.  Dr. Acula therefore could not physically (or contractually) take ownership of the bat house until it was complete.  Gator also estimated that it would take serval months to build the house because Dr. Acula asked for numerous, very unusual, custom bat house amenities (so many that it would take months to change the house back to normal retail condition if Dr. Acula backed out of the contract - the thing would essentially be worthless). Constructing a bat house is fairly straight forward.  All you need is wood and nails.  Also, the design of bat houses is so simple that the same type of wood and nails can be used interchangeably across different bat house projects (even for building custom bat house amenities).  Accordingly, wood and nails in Gator Houses' warehouse are interchangeable until they are specifically assigned to a custom ordered bat house. Work on the Dr. Acula contract did not begin until April 2019 (it was too hot and sunny in 2018 and early 2019 for the doctor to come oversee the construction process - his preference). During 2019, Gator made the following raw material purchases and incurred the following costs:  As of June 30, 2019 (Q2 quarter-end), Gator had purchased $100,000 of wood and nails. Ending wood and nail inventory as of June 30th was $10,000 ($90,000 had been assigned and integrated into Dr. Acula's house).  Further, Gator spent $15,000 in labor putting together all the wood and nails for Dr. Acula's house. During Q3 (three months), Gator spent an additional $800,000 to get more wood and nails ($900,000 in total with Q2 purchases). Ending wood and nail inventory as of September 30, 2019 was $25,000 ($785,000 had been assigned and integrated into Dr. Acula's house).  Further, Gator spent $20,000 in labor putting together all the wood and nails for the project. As of September 30, 2019, Gator figured out that the Dr. Acula project was going to be over budget and it revised its estimated total cost from $1 million to 1.5 million. On October 31, 2019, the world's largest bat house was completed! Gator rushed manufacturing in October (Dr. Acula was especially eager to get his house for his end of the month party).  During October, Gator purchased $500,000 of wood and nails and there was no inventory left over - it was all used for the October rush.  Further, Gator spent $65,000 in labor putting together all the wood and nails for the project.  If Dr. Acula tried to return the bat house and terminate the contract (or tried to cancel the contract while Gator was building the house), then Gator would be entitled to reimbursement for its costs incurred to date plus a markup of 500%, which is considered pretty standard in the bat house manufacturing business.  Gator would not be entitled to reimbursement for any building materials it purchased for the project that had not been used.  In Gator Houses' 119 years of operation, it has never had a product returned (its in-house legal team fiercely disputes any return attempt and has never lost a case with its "bulletproof" contracts). Gator's in-house accounting team needs help on the following (provide citations from the authoritative literature supporting your conclusions as appropriate): (A) How should Gator recognize revenue for the satisfaction of its performance obligation? (B) How much revenue should Gator Houses recognize for each of the periods below (Provide the exact amount of revenue to be recorded each period.  Journal entries and/or balances for any other relevant financial statement account are not required/graded for this problem): (B.1) The three months ended June 30, 2019  (B.2) The three months ended September 30, 2019  (B.3) The three months ended December 31, 2019  Next, Gator wants to know how to account for transferring customer account receivable balances to BatBank. Gator sells wooden stakes to some of its customers (some customers love them, but some customers absolutely hate them) and all sales are on credit. To allow for additional financing options for its customers, Gator has a special relationship with BatBank, an unrelated third-party financial institution. Gator's customers have the option of requesting that Gator transfer its receivables to BatBank. Once such a request is made, the following would occur:  Gator would transfer the customer's receivables to BatBank. BatBank would pay Gator the balance of the receivables in cash. Because BatBank would now hold the receivables from the customer, the customer and BatBank would enter into a low-interest loan agreement to stipulate the repayment terms. Gator gets to maintain effective control of all receivables transferred to BatBank. Specifically, Gator has the unilateral ability to cause BatBank to return any receivable back to Gator. Gator maintains very close relationships with its wooden stake customers, so the unilateral ability to get back any customer receivable from BatBank is certainty a more-than-trivial benefit for Gator.  How should Gator account for transferring customer account receivable balances to BatBank (balance sheet and income statement impact)? Next, Gator wants to know how to account for a big sales contract won by its vaccine manufacturing subsidiary, Viral Limited.  Viral Limited manufactures rabies vaccines.  Gator Houses acquired Viral Limited in 2015 to vertically integrate products of interest to bat enthusiasts.  Viral Limited signed a deal with the United States Federal Government for Viral's vaccine to be placed in the Strategic National Stockpile, the nation's supply of potentially life-saving pharmaceuticals for public health emergencies.  In 2019, Gator transferred $1 million worth of vaccines (retail price) to the U.S. Government.  Gator's in-house accounting team is confused about how to account for the transaction (even after calling the SEC) - please help. Next, Gator wants to apply the ACG 5815 definition of an asset to understanding the accounting for Viral's rabies vaccine sales transactions.  After manufacturing a vial of vaccine, Viral records a journal entry to transfer the vial from work-in-process inventory to finished goods inventory.  Why is the finished goods inventory considered an asset for Viral (discuss each section of the ACG 5815 definition of an asset)?  As part of Viral's sales transactions with the U.S. Government, when does Viral no longer have a finished goods inventory asset (discuss each section of the ACG 5815 definition of an asset)?     Finally, Gator is considering relocating to Romania (they get a lot of business from Transylvania) and is curious about how manufacturing revenue recognition might be different in Romania under IFRS.  Specifically, they are interested in seeing what international standard(s) [and paragraph(s)] govern accounting for performance obligations satisfied over time - please help.

You are a clinician at a hospital-based clinic in a small rural town. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted your community as it is mostly racial/ethnic minority and significantly older than the average community age, with most residents falling below the national poverty threshold. Given these dynamics, your community was elated when it was announced that the local hospital would have access to the COVID-19 vaccine in a few weeks. However, in the initial roll out plans from the local public health authorities, psychologists were left off the list of healthcare workers that would be vaccinated in the first wave. You and your colleagues were upset as you enter the hospital everyday for clinic and work with high-risk populations in person (telehealth options have been limited in your community). Many of your colleagues have contracted COVID from the work setting over the past months. In response, you organize a strong advocacy campaign to your local government to get mental health providers added to the first wave of vaccine distributions. SUCCESS!!! Not only does the local government add psychologists to the first wave, but every professional working in the hospital context is also added. The hospital administration is excited by this news and calls you into a meeting to thank you for your advocacy effort. During that meeting, you find out that the roll out plan has been updated and will begin the following Monday. Specifically, the local government has decided to prioritize hospital employees AND their families (reasoning that the virus will be better contained if families are vaccinated together). Additionally, the hospital will be mandated that employees are vaccinated within the next 6 weeks or they will not be allowed back to work (this would represent a significant economic issue for you as you are paid by the session). You inquire about the number of vaccines this will take to accomplish and learn that due to this prioritization, vaccines will not be available to the second wave (community members over 75) for almost 3 months. You are uncomfortable with this, but you are told that the decisions are final, and vaccinations begin Monday.   a. Use an ethical decision-making model, the APA ethics code (principle and standards), and relevant literature to outline your response to this dilemma. You should look ahead to the four solution options provided in point b as you will have to specify one as your final course of action.   b. You must choose one of the following actions:    You and your family take the vaccine appointment. You take a vaccine appointment but disregard the government mandate to have your family vaccinated and do not bring them to the appointment. You decline the vaccine appointment on behalf of you and your family and determine how to survive with 50% of your family income gone. Other (Specify your own solution to this case). Note *If you select this option, you must specify a solution that satisfies the case without conditions. That is to say, you can not state that if xyz were true, then I could do this. This solution must work within the details given in the case (as the three options above do)    c. Please indicate any actions you take following your decision above.   d. Reflect on this scenario and briefly (1-2 paragraphs) discuss the intersection between ethical and equitable responsibilities for psychologists.

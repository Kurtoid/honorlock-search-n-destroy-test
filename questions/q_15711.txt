In the early days of radio, AM signals were demodulated by the detector given in the following figure.  For AM signal (A+m(t))cos(wt), derive signals in time domain at points a, b, c, and d; and study the behavior of distortion term in y(t), particularly when A>>1.  At point c, the expression of signal is in the form gA2+pAm(t)+qm2 (t)+r m3(t),  fill in the blanks for g [gvalue], p [pvalue],  q [qvalue], and r [rvalue] where possible values {0.25, 0.5, 0, 1, 2, } Derive expression of waveforms at b, c, and d, and identify distortion term in y(t),  submit them in Question 5, 3 pt total.

A particular professor likes to drink his/her coffee at a precise temperature.  But the professor is usually in a hurry.  So he/she makes a pot of concentrated coffee (95.0oC), and mixes with cold water from a refrigerator (4.0oC).  To fill his/her Thermos of 250.0 mL,  the professor mixes 130.0 mL of the concentrated coffee and 120.0 mL of cold water.  What's the professor's favorite temperature of coffee? Assume 1) the densities of water and coffee at all temperature are 1.000 g/mL. 2) specific heat capacities of concentrated coffee and water are all 4.184 J/g oC, 3) the thermos is a perfect insulator with no loss of heat.

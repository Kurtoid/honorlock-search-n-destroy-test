Albert King is a 68-year-old man with a grade 4 glioblastoma. He has a rapid-onset dense left hemiplegia and is being seen by home care nursing, physical therapy, and occupational therapy under the palliative care program. In June, a craniotomy was done to debulk the tumor. After surgery, he discharged himself, against medical recommendations that he stay for inpatient rehabilitation. On his arrival home, an urgent request was sent to home services to clarify his new mobility/transfer status for the home support workers (HSW). The family members were hoping for intensive in-home rehabilitation and in fact expected Mr. King to walk again. Examination revealed grade 1 to 2 strength in scattered leg muscles and a flaccid left arm. Mr. King was unable to sit unsupported. Standing pivot transfers were maximum lift ' 2, so use of the mechanical lift was recommended. These findings were essentially unchanged from Mr. King's preoperative status. Intensive rehabilitation was not feasible, but the therapist agreed to teach the HSW range of motion and facilitation exercises and see him weekly for ongoing reevaluation. Over the succeeding 3 months, Mr. King has been seen eight times, and there has been no motor or sensory recovery. There have been very small functional gains: Mr. King is now able to roll to his weak side in bed using the bedrail. Mr. King has variable wheelchair sitting tolerance (10-60 minutes). Last week, Mrs. King asked about admission to a rehabilitation facility to capitalize on these gains. Given the information provided in the scenario above, would you say that Mr. King is a good candidate for intensive inpatient rehabilitation?  Why or why not?

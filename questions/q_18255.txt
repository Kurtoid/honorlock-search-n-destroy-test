A 100.0 mL sample of 0.300 M NaOH is mixed with a 100.0 mL sample of 0.300 M HNO3 in a coffee cup calorimeter. If both solutions were initially at 35.00degC and the temperature of the resulting solution was recorded as 37.00degC, determine the DHdegrxn (in units of kJ/mol NaOH) for the neutralization reaction between aqueous NaOH and HCl. Assume 1) that no heat is lost to the calorimeter or the surroundings, and 2) that the density (1.00 g/mL) and the heat capacity (4.18 J/gdegC) of the resulting solution are the same as water.

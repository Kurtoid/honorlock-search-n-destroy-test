Consider the following scenario: Mildred is a 96 year old women who is living independently in her home. Her grandson, who is a social worker, stops by each week to help her clean her home and take her grocery shopping. Recently, her health has begun to decline. She has been diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis and has to be on supplemental oxygen 24/7. She also has experienced several falls in the past month, and in one case she laid on her floor for 24 hours before she was found. Her three children want to move her into an assisted living facility. While she acknowledges that independent life is getting more difficult, she is not sure she is ready to give up her home and her freedom. Her grandson feels that he can continue caring for her successfully for the time being, but also realizes that the situation might soon become more complicated. Using the "Looking Forward" technique, compose a script that could be used with the patient to help her make a decision. Explore what the future might look like if she chooses to move to assisted living, versus if she chooses to stay in her home.

THIS QUESTION COUNTS 1 POINT Popeye's Dive Bar is reviewing two investment options for modernizing its Buckhead location -- a step that Popeye's management believes will be important to driving in new business. Option 1 is to install a mechanical bull ride, a strategy modeled after a Bar in Forth Worth Texas that one of Popeye's owner is a co partner in. The other option is install a "silent disco", modeled after similar attractions often seen on cruise ships. The investment and free cash flows related to each project are shown below. Note that the mechanical bull ride would have a useful life of 4 years; whereas the "silent disco" is estimated to require a completely new investment every three years. The equipment used for the silent disco would only have a three year useful life. There would be no salvage value associated with either project. Popeye's management only has the floor space to do one of the projects. Using the NPV method, which project should management select? Popeye's Cost of Capital is 9.35%    Year Mechanical Bull Ride Silent Disco   0 $325,000 $135,000   1 $120,000 $65,000   2 $115,000 $65,000   3 $110,000 $65,000   4 $100,000

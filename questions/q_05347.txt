An investigator is looking at the relation between periodontal disease and the onset of hypertension. Suppose the investigator decides to look at height as a variable that may confound the relationship between exposure and case status in his study.  After collecting information about the height of each participant, he assembles a database that approximates height with the normal distribution.  Assuming the mean of the distribution is 176.2 cm with a standard deviation of 17.5 cm, what are the highest [response1] and lowest [response2] 1% of heights in the population?  Assume the investigator is now looking at the population of Dutch men in his study, and that the mean height there is 184.8 cm with a standard deviation of 16.1 cm, what are the highest [response3] and lowest [response4] 1% of heights in the population? Note that since we are working with a continuous variable here, the precision of your response is important.

Question 3 (10 points) Consider the following three two-dimensional datasets containing two clusters of data points (shown with "circles" and "crosses"). Suppose you would like to apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of each of these datasets from 2-D to 1-D where the two clusters remain separated in the projection space. For each dataset (A, B and C), address each of the following two questions:    (5 points) Will PCA be effective at keeping the two clusters separated in the 1-D projection? Why or why not? If yes, state what characteristics of the dataset allow PCA to be effective. If no, state what characteristics of the dataset cause PCA to fail. (5 points) Can you think of another dimensionality reduction technique that would be successful at reducing the dimensionality for this dataset while maintaining (or increase) class separability? State the other method and describe why it would be successful.

7. Bear gallbladder is used in Chinese medicine to treat inflammation.  Due to the difficulty of obtaining bear gallbladder, Chinese medical researchers are searching for a more readily available source.  A study in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology (June 1995) examined pig gallbladder as an effective substitute for bear gallbladder.  Twenty male mice were divided randomly into two groups:  10 were given a dosage bear bile and 10 were given a dosage of pig bile.  All the mice then received an injection of croton oil in the left ear lobe to induce inflammation.  Four hours later, both the left and right ear lobes were weighed, with the difference (in milligrams) representing the degree of swelling.  Summary statistics are provided below: Bear Bile:       n = 10       sample mean = 9.19       s = 4.17 Pig Bile:       n = 10       sample mean = 9.71       s = 3.33 Assume that the populations of the difference of swelling for bear bile and pig bile ears are normally distributed.  Do the data show that the mean degree of swelling of mice treated with bear bile is significantly less than the mean degree of swelling of mice treated with pig bile?  (While answering the following sub-parts of this question, you will be including the null and alternative hypothesis, the test statistic, the p-value (a visualization and an interpretation), your statistical decision, and your conclusion in the context of the problem.) (c)  What area of the t-distribution should be shaded for the p-value in Step 3 of the hypothesis test?

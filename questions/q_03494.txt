Given , the 2x2 gradient of the cost with respect to the convolutional layer , and , the 3x3 output activations of the previous layer, perform the backward pass and return , the gradient of the cost with respect to the weights  . Note that we want the resulting value at [2,2] (indexing starts at 1) of the gradient . Assume the usual convolutional layer implementation (forward pass is cross-correlation).   Note: The kernel was applied with no padding and stride=1    x11 = [x11] x12 = [x12] x13 = [x13]   x21 = [x21] x22 = [x22] x23 = [x23]   x31 = [x31] x32 = [x32] x33 = [x33]         dh11 = [dh11] dh12 = [dh12]   dh21 = [dh21] dh22 = [dh22]

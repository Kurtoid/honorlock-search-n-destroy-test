A 15.0 kg block is released from rest at point A in the figure below. The track is frictionless except for the portion between points B and C, which has a length of 6.00 m. The block travels down the track, hits a spring of force constant 2,150 N/m, and compresses the spring 0.430 m from its equilibrium position before coming to rest momentarily. Determine the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the rough surface between points B and C.

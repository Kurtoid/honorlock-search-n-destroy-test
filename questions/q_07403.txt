Help Bob train a neural network: Your friend Bob is interning at GNVShoppingAnalytics, a local startup that does predictive analytics for online shopping. Bob wants to train a classification model to predict what kind of item a customer is likely to purchase next on the basis of features such as their past purchases, current items in the shopping cart, etc. Specifically, each customer is represented as a vector of 100 numerical features and the task is to predict what type of item the customer is most likely to buy next. There are 24 distinct item types. In this problem, you will help Bob figure out a suitable neural network architecture to use. Consider the following (partial) architecture:  Input: each example x is represented as a vector of 100 features Hidden Layer 1: FC(64) with ReLU activation Hidden Layer 2: FC(2) with ReLU activation Output Layer: FC

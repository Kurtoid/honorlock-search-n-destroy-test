Here is the link for UF Apps: https://info.apps.ufl.edu A word is a palindrome if it reads the same backwards as it does forward (ex. racecar, rotator, abccba). Write a program to determine whether or not the characters in a given string can be rearranged into a palindrome.  For example, the letters in 'cabcba' can be rearranged into 'abccba', which is a palindrome.  The user will always input letters in lowercase, with no spaces or punctuation. Display 'Yes!' if the letters of a given string can be arranged into a palindrome, otherwise display 'No!'. Note: You do not have to rearrange the letters, simply determine whether or not it is possible to create a palindrome out of the given string. Test Case 1: Enter a string of characters: raacrecYes! Test Case 2: Enter a string of characters: abcNo! Test Case 3: Enter a string of characters: ycycychNo! Test Case 4: Enter a string of characters: ssaaippakiviikauuppYes! Test Case 5: Enter a string of characters: abcddabcdaNo!
Answer the following question based on the following scenarioYou ask for a guest tray but all the plates have been used. The diet aide takes a dirty dish and washed it off in the sink and hands it to the cook to plate the food on. You follow the tray cart down to the unit which leaves the kitchen at 11:30am. As you wait for all the trays to be delivered so you can take your guest tray, you notice no one is available to start serving the trays. At 11:50, a nurse aide begins passing out trays. As you observe her passing out trays, you notice she set up a tray in a room where the patient was not back from therapy yet. In the next room, she set up the tray on the bedside table which was not in reach of the patient and in the third room the patient was given the wrong tray. When the patient made the nursing aide aware it was the wrong tray, she took the tray out and delivered it to the right patient across the hall. At 12:30, all the trays were delivered and you take your guest tray to audit it. The tray is a pureed diet, temperature of the meat and vegetable were under recommendations for serving. The consistency was too thin and food was dripping off the plate onto the tray. No beverages were on the tray and there was a large chip in the plate ware. 17. Which of the following tags would most likely be issued upon inspection? a. F908 - flies in the kitchenb. F550 - patient unable to reach foodc. F584 - not properly sanitizing plated. F880 - setting tray up with no patient there

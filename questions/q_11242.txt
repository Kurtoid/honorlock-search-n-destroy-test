A group of researchers developed a new test method for detection of synthetic marijuana (i.e., K2) in human saliva. A series of validation studies were conducted to measure performance of the test method. The results of the study are reported below.    KNOWN Predictions by Analyst SUM   Positive for K2 Negative for K2   Positive for K2 488 12 500   Negative for K2 119 381 500   SUM 607 393 1000      The researchers measured the performance of their method by calculating its accuracy using the equation shown below:  where TP is true positive, TN is true negative, P is known positive and N is known negative. Calculate the accuracy.
Suppose that we decide that anything that occurs less than 5% of the time is considered an unusual occurrence. Each of the bonus question will be a dropdown questions with two parts. First choose the correct probability and then state if the probability of that event occurring is usual or unusual.  While the questions will be listed as having 0 points, each question where both parts are answered correctly will be worth 2 points. After all students have taken the exam, I will go back and add whatever bonus points a student earns.

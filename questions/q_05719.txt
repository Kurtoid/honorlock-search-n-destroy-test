Two boxes are sliding on a horizontal frictionless surface.  Box m1 = 4.0 kg, sliding at v1i = +24 m/s (to the right), collides with box m2 = 8.0 kg, sliding at -5.0 m/s (to the left).  They stick together and both boxes collide with a horizontal spring with spring constant 6800 N/m.  a)  Find the velocity of the two boxes after the collision. b)  Find the maximum compression of the spring. Start with given equations.  Show all your work.

2. Read the passage and answer the questions that follow (5)                How was Stonehenge built?             It is a question that has baffled people for centuries - and even to this day, no theory has been proven! How could people thousands of years ago have transported and arranged such colossal stones?   A legend from the 12th century claimed giants placed the monument on a mountain in Ireland before a wizard named Merlin magically moved the stone circle to England. It is a shame they did not really have a wizard to help them - they could have done with the help...   The lighter bluestones weigh about 3,600kg each (that is the same as two cars!), while the bigger sarsen stones each weigh a whopping 22 tonnes - that is as heavy as four African elephants! Archaeologists believe that the sarsen stones were hauled to the site on big wooden sledges from 32km away, but the bluestones have been traced to rock outcrops 225km away in Wales! It is thought they could have been dragged on sledges to a waterway and then floated on rafts to the building site.   Shaping the stones would have required hundreds of hours of hard graft with stone hammers and chisels. But how were the ginormous boulders lifted to their standing position? Well, it is thought that first, the builders dug deep ditches for the base of the boulders. They then used ropes and strong wooden poles and frames to raise them up, before packing the ditches with rocks and rubble to hold them in place. And voila - job is done!

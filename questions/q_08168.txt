1e) Draw the complete mixed-logic circuit diagram below.  Use only ROM and D-FFs; use no SSI (ANDs, ORs, etc.), MSI elements (Decoders, MUXs, etc.) or additional LSI elements (RAMs, PALs, PLDs, etc.). All inputs and outputs of the circuit should be clearly indicated coming into or out of a box. Show all of the signals on a typical ROM with connections to each (including CE(L), OE(L), AX and DY). Use either activation level for P. Use your scratch paper and label this 1e.

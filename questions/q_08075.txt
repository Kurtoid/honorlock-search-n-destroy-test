Uber is a company that has targeted Millennials in its marketing by utilizing results from surveys that indicate Millennials are less interested in types of cars and more interested in convenience and utility in transportation. A marketing researcher collects data from a random sample of 30 Millennials (age 18-35) in a large urban area, asking them how many times they have used Uber for transport over the past year. The results are shown in the table below.    12 5 3 0 2 4 35 3 4 19   10 6 1 6 12 9 2 6 7 6   18 2 5 2 4 6 4 7 10 2       Calculate the 5-Number Summary for this set of data. Describe the shape of the distribution of the data. (You may want to sketch a graph of the data on a separate piece of paper.) Would it be more appropriate to report the mean or the median for this data set? Explain your answer. What is the range of the middle 50% of the data?  Does the data have outliers?

Janie is a 3-month-old infant participating in an experiment. She's lying in her crib with one end of a ribbon tied to her foot and the other end tied to a mobile dangling over her crib. She quickly learns that she controls the movement of the mobile with her kicking. One week later, the researchers return, tie the ribbon to her foot and hang the mobile above her crib. Immediately, Janie starts vigorously kicking her leg. What does this experiment demonstrate?

A schematic shown in Figure 5 of a piping system that is used to move water at 20 degC from a lower pond to an upper pond using a pump at a flowrate of Q = 0.1 m3/s. The elevation between the two ponds is 40 m. The diameter of the plastic piping with an inner diameter of D=10 cm with a roughness factor of e = 0 and a net length of l= 300 m. The loss coefficients for the entrance, exit, 90deg elbows, and valve are provided in Figure 5.   Figure 5.   Assuming steadying, incompressible flow, determine the following:  Minor losses in m; major losses using the Moody chart in m; and the required shaft work to overcome losses and elevation changes in kW .

A mass m1=2.00 kg undergoes circular motion of radius R=30.0 cm on a horizontal frictionless table, connected by a massless string through a hole in the table to a second mass m2=3.00 kg as shown above. Mass m2 is stationary and friction between m1 and the table is negligible. Assume g=10.0 m/s2. Check all that apply.
Given the information in the accompanying table, calculate the correlation coefficient between the returns on Stocks A and B.     Stock A Stock B   E(RA ) = mA = 8.4% E(RB ) = mB = 6.5%   sA = 10.80% sB = 7.29%   Cov(RA,RB ) = sAB = 16.70%

You are enjoying your bike ride as shown below. When you reach the base of the bridge, you are travelling along the road at 5.00 m/s. At the top of the bridge, you have climbed a vertical distance of 5.20 m and also slowed down to 1.50 m/s. Ignore the work done by friction and also ignore any inefficiencies in your bike or your legs! Assuming the combined mass of you and your bike is 80.0 kg, how much work you have done with the force that you applied to the bike pedals?

You will use the following information for this question. You are managing a farm in the Intermountain West and you are concerned about the potential drought, and you are deciding whether to alter your crop mix and plant some more drought tolerant crops.  Unfortunately, those crops tend to not yield as much as your current crop mix if moisture is sufficient.  You look at past irrigation supply data to decide how often irrigation supplies are reduced versus normal or above normal irrigation supplies.  You then do some enterprise budget and partial budget analyses for adding the new crop or doing nothing.  You estimate the following payoff matrix.               Management Action     Irrigation water supply   Probability   Add new crop (returns over variable costs)   Do nothing (returns over variable costs)         Normal to above normal   0.60   $432,700   $452,500         Below normal   0.40   $405,900   $387,700         Expected Value       $421,980   $426,980         26. If you are a risk neutral manager which management action would you choose?

Use the following information for questions 23 and 24. Sweet Corp produces a single product and uses standard costing.  Budgeted production in 2020 was 125,000 units and actual production in 2020 was 100,000 units.   Sweet sold 90,000 units at a selling price of $50 per unit in 2020.   There was no beginning inventory in 2020.  The only variance is the fixed manufacturing overhead production volume variance, which is closed to cost of goods sold at year end.  Fixed manufacturing cost is allocated based on a budgeted volume of 125,000 units.  Budgeted and actual cost information are as follows:  Variable manufacturing cost of $20 per unit Fixed manufacturing cost of $2,000,000 Variable selling and administrative cost of $2 per unit sold Fixed selling and administrative cost of $300,000

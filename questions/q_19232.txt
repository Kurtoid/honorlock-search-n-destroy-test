Act 1, Scene 3   ALL The weird sisters, hand in hand, Posters of the sea and land, Thus do go about, about: Thrice to thine and thrice to mine And thrice again, to make up nine. Peace! the charm's wound up. Enter MACBETH and BANQUO  MACBETH So foul and fair a day I have not seen.  BANQUO How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these So wither'd and so wild in their attire, That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth, And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught That man may question? You seem to understand me, By each at once her chappy finger laying Upon her skinny lips: you should be women, And yet your beards forbid me to interpret That you are so.  MACBETH Speak, if you can: what are you?  First Witch All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!  Second Witch All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!  Third Witch All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!  BANQUO Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth, Are ye fantastical, or that indeed Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner You greet with present grace and great prediction Of noble having and of royal hope, That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not. If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear Your favours nor your hate.  First Witch Hail!  Second Witch Hail!  Third Witch Hail!  First Witch Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.  Second Witch Not so happy, yet much happier.  Third Witch Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none: So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!  First Witch Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!  MACBETH Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more: By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis; But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives, A prosperous gentleman; and to be king Stands not within the prospect of belief, No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence? or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you. Witches vanish  BANQUO The earth hath bubbles, as the water has, And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?  MACBETH Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!  BANQUO Were such things here as we do speak about? Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner?  MACBETH Your children shall be kings.  BANQUO You shall be king.  MACBETH And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?

Question 3 - Multivariate Modeling (30 Points) A. Using the matrix pertaining to the level of differencing used in Q2, fit an unrestricted VAR model using the order selected with the AIC metric. If other metrics would potentially select different orders, state what they would be and comment on the possible cause of the difference. B. For each time series in the VAR model in part A, identify first two variable-lag combinations to exclude from the unrestricted VAR model using using stepwise regression (Hint: you would have to fit a separate regression model to each time series and apply the step() command in R - we are providing some starting code to set up the regression for the NASDAQ time series). Conclude whether resulting models yield better R-squared than in the unrestricted VAR model. Comment on whether you think the final model we would obtain if we completed variable elimination would be better than unrestricted VAR model. C. Run Granger causality tests for all variable couples. Evaluate Granger causality using the significance level of 0.05. Provide conclusions in the context of the problem.

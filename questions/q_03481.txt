In "How Does Language Shape the Way We Think," Lera Boroditsky discusses an experiment that provides some evidence to support the position that language influences thought. In this experiment three sets of "subjects" (English speakers; Hebrew speakers; and "locals" from an Aboriginal community in Australia called the Kuuk Thaayorre) were given "sets of pictures that showed some kind of temporal progression (e.g., pictures of a man aging, or a crocodile growing, or a banana being eaten). [The] job [of each "subject" group] was to arrange the shuffled photos  . . . to show the correct temporal order." How did the "spatial orientation" of the Kuuk Thaayorre "subjects" influence the way they arranged the set of cards? Why was this and how does this provide some "evidence" that language does influence thought?

Questions 9 and 10 refer to the following passage: Finally, China and Japan were on somewhat different paths when the Western challenge intruded in the mid-nineteenth century. China was suffering one of its recurrent dynastic declines. Government became less efficient, intellectual life stagnated, and popular unrest surged. A cycle of renewal might have followed, with a new dynasty seizing more vigorous reins.

In contrast, Japan maintained political and economic vigor into the nineteenth century. Whereas by the late nineteenth century China needed Western guidance simply to handle such bureaucratic affairs as tariff collection and repression of peasant rebellion, Japan suffered no such breakdown of authority, using foreign advisors far more selectively. In what ways did foreign interaction influence the political developments discussed in the passage?

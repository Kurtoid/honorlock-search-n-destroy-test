Space Antenna Corporation is currently using a single predetermined overhead rate based on direct labor hours to allocate manufacturing overhead to its two products: Lo-Gain antennas and Hi-Gain antennas for use in remote areas. The company is considering the use of activity-based costing (ABC). The following information is provided about the production of the two product lines:    Activity Cost Allocation Base   Setup $51,000 Setups   Machine Maintenance 39,000 Machine hours   Total manufacturing overhead costs $90,000          Quantity per Product Line Lo-Gain Hi-Gain   Direct labor hours 1,700 2,300   Setups 50 50   Machine hours 1,800 1,200    Space Antenna plans to produce 170 Lo-Gain antennas and 300 Hi-Gain antennas. Manufacturing overhead cost per unit of a Lo-Gain antenna, using the single plant-wide rate is closest to:

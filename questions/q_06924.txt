(3)Dr. Stickgold hypothesizes that the reason the brain needs these particular kinds of sleep is that certain brain chemicals plummet during the first part of the night, and information flows out of the hippocampus (the memory region) and into the cortex. (4)He thinks the brain then distributes the new information into appropriate networks and categories. (5)Inside the brain, proteins strengthen the connections between nerve cells consolidating the new skills learned the day before. (6)Then later, during REM, the brain re-enacts the lessons from the previous day and solidifies the newly-made connections through the memory banks.

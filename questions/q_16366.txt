Tony Stark doesn't have any real superpowers, but he does have an amazing exercise physiologist: you. Since he hasn't worked out in awhile, you are starting him with a light aerobic workout: walk at a level of energy expenditure (VO2) of 18 ml/kg/min. Solve for the percent grade he would need to walk at if he was walking at a speed of 67 m/min. Round your answer to one place after the decimal and do not include the percent sign when entering your answer. Equations:Age predicted maximum heart rate = 220 - age Intensity: Percent of age predicted heart rate maximum = (220 - age) x (% intensity / 100) Heart rate reserve = (HRmax/peak - HRrest) x (% intensity / 100) + HRrest VO2 Reserve = (VO2max/peak - VO2rest) x (% intensity / 100) + VO2rest Metabolic Equations: Walking: VO2 = 3.5 + (0.1 x speed) + (1.8 x speed x grade)  Jogging: VO2 = 3.5 + (0.2 x speed) + (0.9 x speed x grade)

Question 1.1: Assume that GM's production possibilities frontier (PPF) is the following:  Suppose that the relative price of components was  in the U.S. in the absence of offshoring. Suppose now that GM has the option to offshore some of its production to other countries and that component production is relatively cheaper in the rest of the world so that< Which of the following options shows correctly how offshoring affects GM's own production of components and R&D?  a)b)  c)d)

Given an AM receiver with 1 diode, 2 capacitors and 1 resistor as follow.  (2) Design a FM receiver by adding one device in the block diagram in the above AM receiver.  What is the additional device? [addition] {adder, multipler, limiter, or d/dt}. Where to put it? [where1] {front, middle, or end} Sketch your design of FM receiver. Discuss your design by sketch waveforms at each stage when the message signal is a cosine signal. (2 pts) (3) (1 pt) If we can add another device in FM receiver in (2) to reduce the noise effect, what kind of device is it? [what] {adder, multipler, limiter, or d/dt}. Where to put it?

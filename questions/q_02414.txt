Write a method divisors(int n) that returns the number of divisors of a positive integer n that is passed into the method. A divisor of an integer n, also called a factor of n, is an integer which divides n without leaving a number. For example, the number 200 has 12 divisors (1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 200). Therefore divisors(200) should return 12. It is easy to test whether a number is a divisor or another number by the modulus operation. For example, 25 is a divisor of 200 because 200 % 25 is equal to 0; 6 is not a divisor of 200 because 200 mod 6 is equal to 2.    Note: You do not need to write a main method.

A 13-year-old girl presented to her dentist with a painful tooth in the upper left back region. Her medical history revealed that she suffered from patent ductus arteriosus which was resolved surgically at 6yo.  The patient appeared tall and slender with her body weight measuring less than average for her age and sex. She had disproportionately long arms and legs as compared with the trunk. Examination of her hands revealed elongated fingers with a positive Walker Murdoch wrist sign, with overlapping of the complete distal phalanx and little finger when wrapped around the opposite wrist indicating extreme ligamentous laxity. An examination of the feet revealed that she had flat feet with mild pronation along with elongated toes. She also had a subtly indented chest, mild hunching of the back and myopia.  Which of the following genetic red flags is most apparent in this case, suggesting that this patient might have a genetic condition?    A Affected as a result of consanguinity   B Early age at onset   C Ethnic predisposition   D Family history    E Pleiotropic signs and symptoms

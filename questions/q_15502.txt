A case control study "Factors associated with anesthetic-related death in dogs and cats in primary care veterinary hospitals" was reported in JAVMA (Mar 15, 2017). In this study, animals that died due to anesthesia complications (cases, outcome +) were compared to animals undergoing similar anesthesia that did not die (controls, outcome-). The medical record was examined to determine exposures or factors which might be associated with post-anesthetic death. One of the exposure factors examined was "pre-anesthetic physical exam findings recorded [exposure +]" vs "pre-anesthetic physical exam findings NOT recorded [exposure -]". The following were reported from the measure of association between cases (death) and exposure (physical exam findings recorded): OR =0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.43, p-value 0.006.  Select the correct response:

Fuel Efficiency (Canvas Q24~26, Handwritten Pages Q24) The fuel efficiency of a vehicle describes how far the vehicle is able to drive with a given amount of fuel. A car has measured its fuel efficiency on the freeway to be [eff] yards per cubic inch of gasoline (yd/in3); in other words, that is the number of yards a car can travel after consuming 1 cubic inch of gasoline. What is this car's fuel efficiency in units of meters per milliliter of gasoline?  (Additional 6 points) On your Handwritten Pages, show all of your work and box your final answer. ( Q24 ) Type in only the numerical portion of your answer, properly rounded to the correct number of sig figs, here. (Note: Canvas will not show trailing zeroes - you will not be marked down if your number here is missing a trailing zero.)

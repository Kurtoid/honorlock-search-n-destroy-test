10. Draw a PCM output frame for two (4 bits) shift registers.                                   11. A PCM system uses 20 channels of data, two for identification purpose. The sampling rate is 9.4 kHz. The word length is 2B. Determine: a) the number of available data channels, b) the number of bits per frame, and c) the serial data rate.                                     12. A T1 frame has 14 channels; each serial digital word (8 bits (7 bits magnitude & 1 bit polarity)). Each frame is sampled at 8 MHz. Determine for a T1C (2T1): a) the sampling interval; b) the channel sampling interval & rate; c) total number of bits per frame; d) the total bit rate                                     13. A coax cable has a bandwidth of 560 MHz to transmit multiple TV signals (161). Determine: a) the bandwidth for each channel; b) how does the total number of channels change, if each channel requires an additional 50 kHz buffer?                                     14. How long does it take to transmit one PCM frame with 16 bytes, 2b synchronization, and a clock rate of 64 MHz?

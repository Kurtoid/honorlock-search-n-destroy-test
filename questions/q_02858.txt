PREDATION  Question 6. Suppose that stoat and vole populations are governed by Lotka-Volterra predation dynamics. The population growth rate of the vole is 0.5, the stoat capture efficiency is 0.01, the mortality rate of stoats is 0.001, and the efficiency with which voles are converted to stoat offspring is 0.01. A survey of the population estimates the initial population size is 200 stoats and 100 voles. A. Where does the vole isocline cross the y-axis (the number)? B. Where does the stoat isocline cross the x-axis (the number)?     Equations   dP/dt = bcNP - mP   dN/dt = rN - cNP   P = r/c   N = m/bc   r = b - d   Nt = Noert   Nt+1 = rNt   dN/dt = rN (1- (N/K))    There should be one number per question in your answer below.

Suppose we wish to test the PO assumption in the above model, i.e., test the adequacy of the PO model vs. a generalized ordinal (GENORD) model. A GENORD model is fit, and its deviance is 96.7486. What is the value of the test statistic for the test? Round all quantities, including your final answer, to two decimals places.
A plot of the velocity vs. time for a particle moving in one dimension is shown below.  The particle starts from rest at t = 0 seconds and accelerates at a constant rate until t = 2 seconds, when the velocity is 5 m/s.  The particle continues at this speed until t = 5 s and then slows at a constant rate until t = 8 s, when its velocity is zero.  What is the average velocity of the particle between 2 and 8 seconds?
True or False: If you're in a weightless environment a force is required to accelerate an object. (Hint, think about Newton's laws)

A distributor of textbooks and a college bookstore entered into a written contract stating that the distributor would sell 100 copies of a popular textbook to the bookstore for $50 each, to be delivered no later than August 1, so that the books would be available for resale to students during the fall semester. The bookstore chose to order from this distributor because its price for the textbook was lower than that of other distributors. Shortly after the bookstore placed its order, the distributor raised its prices due to a sudden surge in popularity of that book. Because the distributor did not have enough textbooks to accommodate all of the different schools using that book, it decided to deliver textbooks only to those buyers who had ordered them at the increased price. The distributor notified the bookstore that it would not deliver the textbooks it ordered. The bookstore filed an action to force the distributor to deliver the textbooks at the agreed-upon price. Will the court compel the distributor to deliver the textbooks to the bookstore?

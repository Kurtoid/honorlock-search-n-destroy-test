A food delivery person delivered some groceries to a man staying at a small motel. She was paid with a $100 bill which covered the price of delivering the groceries and a very nice tip for her. She was dismayed to learn that the bill was counterfeit. The police were notified and decided to talk to the man to see what he might know about the counterfeit bill. An officer went to the motel and knocked on the man's door. The man answered the door, and the officer asked if he could come in, have a chat, and take a look around. The man, believing that he had no other choice but to let the officer inside, agreed. Once inside, the officer discovered $5 bills soaking in a solution, washed and now blank bills drying, and a computer and several printers. The officer also saw stacks of what appeared to be $100 bills in an open suitcase on the dresser. The officer promptly arrested and handcuffed the man, put him in the squad car, and seized the bills and computer equipment. Prior to the man's trial for the production and distribution of counterfeit money, the man's attorney moved to suppress the evidence as having been illegally seized. Should the motion be granted?

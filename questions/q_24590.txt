Hold dirty linens close to the body while discarding them into the laundry bagc. Keep the head of the bed elevated during the procedured. Discontinue the oxygen temporarily while making the bed

TOTAL SECTION A:   [15]
In a particular species of ladybug, "black wings with orange spots" is dominant, whereas "orange wings with black spots" is recessive.  In a population of 260 of these ladybugs, 123 of the population have orange wings with black spots.  (Assume that the population is at equilibrium). Assuming the population is at equilibrium, calculate the genotype frequencies and the allele frequencies.  Make sure to calculate your answers to three decimal places.  (Note: the symbols below are NOT necessarily in the order in which they are calculated.  Just select the appropriate blank to fill in as you work out your calculations.)  The value of "p" is  [p]. The value of "q" is  [q]. The value of "p2" is  [p2]. The value of "q2" is  [q2]. The value of "2pq" is [2pq]. The actual count for the individuals who are heterozygous dominant is [Q6]. In the Hardy-Weinberg equation, p represents [Q7].

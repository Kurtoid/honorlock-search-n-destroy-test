For this test, as for previous ones, you MUST have a minimum of 125 words and 10 sentences. If you go under this amount, your test can receive only a zero.  Please remember that you are NOT allowed to use any outside content; this means, you cannot use the Internet, books, papers, etc. You must type the test paragraph completely on your own with no help from anyone or anything else.  TOPIC: "Sacrifice is a part of life. It's supposed to be. It's not something to regret. It's something to aspire to. Little sacrifices. Big sacrifices. A mother works so her son can go to school. A daughter moves home to take care of her sick father." (from Five People You Meet in Heaven) Your topic for this test paragraph concerns sacrifices that you have made for others. Describe what you have given up for others in order to help them. Have you given up money, a job, a dating life, a friendship, a bad habit, a hobby/interest, etc.? These are the things I want you to write about. Build your paragraph about 2-3 sacrifices. Be sure to have a strong, guiding topic sentence that specifically names these 2-3 sacrifices.

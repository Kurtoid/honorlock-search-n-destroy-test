Gilbert's Gap Bakery, located in Hollywood Hollow Kentucky, was a regionally famous bakery of cookies and cupcakes, which were packaged and sold in retail establishments throughout Kentucky, Southern Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana. Gilbert's Gap Bakery had just baked and packaged a large batch of their number one bestselling cookies, the caramel creme filled, coconut and cashew topped Gilbert's Sweet Sliders. They were very good. They were packaged in foil-covered boxes, but somehow some of them had become infested with insects. It turned out that already 20 boxes had been sold in the retail store connected to the bakery, but none had been shipped yet.

Giselle Gabriela Golander, the manager of logistics, said they should give them all to the local charity to give to the poor people, since she said "poor people won't be particular about a few bugs here and there. Poor people like cookies, especially homeless people. " He said it would be good for the community. What should the bakery do? To answer this question, the first question that the decision maker should ask himself or herself, should be:

"Animals Have ESP." pages 44 - 63 "Many people report instances of ESP involving their pets -- for example, when a dog appears to know when its owner will arrive home, even when the owner comes home at different times each day.

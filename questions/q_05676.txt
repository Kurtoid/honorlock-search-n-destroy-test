A defendant was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. On direct examination, the defendant testified that he worked with disadvantaged children as a drug counselor, that he hated drugs, that he would "never possess or distribute drugs," and that he had never used drugs and would not touch them. The government offered as a rebuttal witness a police officer who would testify that, three years earlier, he saw the defendant buy cocaine from a street dealer. The defendant objected. Is the testimony of the police officer about the prior drug transaction admissible to impeach the defendant?

To acidify the lumen of lysosomes (compartments in the cell involved in breakdown and recycling of biomolecules), V-type ATPase transporters are used to pump protons (H+) into the lumen (interior) of the lysosome. If the pH of the inside of the cell (cytosol) is 7.4 (4 x 10-8 M H+) and the luminal pH of the lysosome is 4.0 (1 x 10-4 M H+), calculate the free energy for a mole of protons (H+) to be pumped from the cytosol into the lumen of the lysosome. Note: We can consider, when determining membrane potential, that the movement of a solute molecule from the cytosol into the lumen of a lysosome is the same as movement from the inside of the cell to outside the cell. Assume: DGt = RT ln(C2/C1) or  DGt = RT ln(C2/C1) + Z FDps T= 310 K R= 8.315 J/mol*K F= 96,480 J/mol*V (Faraday's constant) Dps = -50 mV (membrane potential, inside)

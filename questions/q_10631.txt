QUESTION 3         A light inelastic string connects two objects of mass 5kg and 2,5 kg respectively. They are pulled across a rough horizontal surface, with a force of magnitude F. Ignore the mass of the string.. The coefficient of friction for the 5 kg and 2,5 kg objects are 0,2 and 0,1 respectively.           Right click on the button below to open the image in a new tab.        3.1   State Newton's second law in words.   (2)     3.2   Draw a free body diagram of all the forces acting on the 2,5 kg object   (5)     3.3   Calculate the tension in the string if the system accelerates to the right at 2 m.s-2.                (5)     3.4   Calculate the magnitude of the force F if the system moves to the right at constant velocity.   (6)     3.5   The same applied force F is now applied at an angle of [?] to the horizontal.               Right click on the button below to open the image in a new tab.                      3.5.1   How will the coefficient of friction be affected? Write down, INCREASES, DECREASES or REMAINS THE SAME.   (1)     3.5.2   How will the kinetic frictional force on the 2,5 kg object be affected?  Write down, INCREASES, DECREASES or REMAINS THE SAME. Explain your answer.   (4)             [23]

When implementing  forward propagation in a feed forward network using dropout, a hyperparameter  is set to determine the  probability  of sampling a mask value of 1 (this means the unit will be  included). The value of this hyperparameter  for hidden layers must always be the same as  the value set for the input layer.
The FCC places no limits on the amount of power that can be generated by an IR.

16. Read the following passage from an essay on culture by American anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn (1905-1960). Then choose which statement is most logically supported by the information.  promiscuous: active sexually and relatively unselective about sexual partners celibacy:          going without sexual activity reciprocities: exchanges Every culture must deal with the sexual instinct.  Some, however, seek to deny all sexual expression before marriage, whereas a Polynesian adolescent who was not promiscuousdeg would be distinctly abnormal.  Some cultures enforce lifelong monogamy, while others, like our own, tolerate serial monogamy; in still other cultures, two or more women may be joined to one man or several men to a single woman.  Homosexuality has been a permitted pattern in the Greco-Roman world, in parts of Islam, and in various primitive tribes.  Large portions of the population of Tibet, and of Christendom at some places and periods, have practiced complete celibacydeg.  To us marriage is first and foremost an arrangement between two individuals.  In many more societies marriage is merely one facet of a complicated set of reciprocitiesdeg, economic and otherwise, between two families or two clans.
Three 3 phase loads are connected in parallel. One is a purely resistive load connected in wye. It consumes 300kW. The second is a purely inductive 300kVAR load connected in wye. The third is a purely capacitive 300kVAR load connected in wye. The line -to-line voltage at the load is 5kV. A 3 phase distribution line supplying this load has an impedance of 10+j5 ohms per phase.  (a) Calculate the currents drawn by each load (magnitude and phase). (b) Indicate the power factor of each load. Remember that non - unity power factors must also include whether they are lagging or leading. (c) What is the power factor of the entire load?  (d) Calculate the real and reactive power absorbed by the loads.

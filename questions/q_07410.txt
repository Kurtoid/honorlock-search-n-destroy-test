Repeated for your convenience: the Sun Company manufactures a special line of graphic tubing items. The company estimates it will sell 75,000 units of this item in 2021. The beginning finished goods inventory contains 20,000 units. The target for each year's ending inventory is 10,000 units. Each unit requires five feet of plastic tubing. The tubing inventory (i.e., beginning raw materials inventory) currently includes 70,000 feet of plastic tubing. Materials on hand (i.e., ending raw materials inventory) are targeted to equal three months' production needs. Any shortage in materials will be made up by the immediate purchase of materials. Sales and production take place evenly throughout the year.  What are the materials requirements (in feet) for 2021 (i.e., how many feet of DM will be necessary to purchase in 2021)? (For the calculation of the desired ending raw material inventory assume that production in 2022 will be exactly the same as in 2021.)

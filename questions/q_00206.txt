Instructions: Read the paragraph below and then answer the questions that follow by selecting the letter of the correct response. Many young people don't bother to register to vote, and those who do often don't show up at the polls on Election Day. But they should. Why? There are good reasons for every eligible young person to vote in every election. First of all, people ages eighteen to thirty should vote because many of the biggest issues affect the nation's youth. Wars in which young soldiers are dying, education funding, employment and job training programs, and reproductive rights are just a few of the issues that are affecting the lives of young people right now. Young people should help to select government representatives who share their views on these matters. When this country's youth don't vote, they don't have any influence on how these issues are decided, and they allow older people to decide how things will work. Plus, an individual who chooses not to vote really has no right to complain about government decisions he or she doesn't like. Being able to vote is a precious gift, one that no one should take for granted. Many people have fought and died so that all Americans would get and keep the right to participate in a democratic government. To honor their sacrifice, all of the young people in America should register, vote, and make themselves heard!

This will air at 5pm.  Use the facts in the narrative below to guide your story.  Include an anchor intro, package, and anchor tag with all banners and proper commands/formatting. Draw a line where the anchor intro ends and package begins. Draw another line where the package ends and the anchor tag begins.  Your sig out is "(your name), KAKE-T-V". Double check your work to avoid fact errors, spelling errors, and grammar mistakes. Make sure you spell Wichita correctly.    Fact Narrative: City council's meeting chamber had 63 attendees present and 47 spoke during the public comment period.  People against the subsidy think city government should not use tax dollars to help just one business.  The park will feature 13 new waterslides and will be the largest water park in the state.  In a 5-3 vote, Wichita City Council has voted to subsidize Waterland's water bill by 20%.  The subsidy will be paid from the city's annual budget, which is made up of tax payer dollars.  Waterland is a new water park opening next month in Wichita.   People who support the subsidy say it will help the water park operate and draw thousands of visitors from all over Kansas, which will actually bring even more money to the local economy.  Wichita City Council will save the water park about $1 million per year by lowering its bill 20% each month.  Two members of the public spoke in favor of the water park's water bill subsidy and 45 spoke against it.  The water park will use five million gallons of water each day.    Soundbites:  Patrick Pippin, Wichita Resident and supports the subsidy  "This is about drawing in local businesses that can transform our local economy. Sometimes we have to sweeten the pot to bring business to Kansas." 10 secs "If we give a little up front, we stand to gain a lot more. The water park will bring millions of dollars to our local economy so it is a wise investment." 9 secs "I can't wait to bring my family to Waterland. Finally, we do not have to drive to Denver or Kansas City.  We can stay right here at home." 9 secs  Amanda Gonzalez, Wichita Resident against the subsidy  "The city does not subsidize my water bill. Why would they do this for a big company? Our own citizens are struggling and they are cutting slack to big business."  10 secs "This decision is really a slap in the face to all the hard working people in our community. This is our money that council is now wasting." 10 secs "This is just another example of favoring the big guy over the little guy. It is just a sad thing to see. We are better than this." 7 secs

Consider the following C code.  Assume that x, y, and any array you declare are aligned on a 32 byte boundary.  Note 128 is an integer multiple of 8.  Use AVX intrinsics to transform the code to improve performance while still producing the same results.  You may find the AVX prototypes in the table useful for this problem. float sum, x[128], y[128];sum = 0.0;for (i = 0; i < 128; i++)   sum += x[i] * 2.0 + y[i];    Prototype Explanation   __m256 _mm256_load_ps(float *p); Loads 8 FP values from the p address and returns the 4 values as one __m256 value.   void _mm256_store_ps(float *p, __m256 v); Stores the __m256 value in v at the address specified in p.   __m256 _m256_add_ps(__m256 a, __m256 b); Returns the sum of __m256 values in a and b.   __m256 _m256_mul_ps(__m256 a, __m256 b); Returns the product of __m256 values in a and b.   __m256 _mm256_set_ps(float v1, ..., float v8); Takes eight scalar values as input and constructs and returns one __m256 value.

Question 2 The figure below depicts the United States' market for cases of wine.
3-kg of water executes a Carnot heat engine cycle in a piston-cylinder device in the saturated liquid-vapor mixture region. The water is heated at 190oC to change from a saturated liquid (State 1) to a saturated vapor (State 2) during the reversible isothermal expansion process.  Next the saturated vapor expands adiabatically to State 3 with a temperature of 35oC and a quality of 80% followed by a reversible isothermal compression process to reach State 4.   Sketch the cycle on a P-v diagram with the saturation curve shown. Please clearly label each of the 4 states, and indicates the heat transfer terms involved in the cycle.  Determine the thermal efficiency of this Carnot heat engine cycle. Determine the heat transfer and work output during the reversible isothermal expansion process from State 1 to State 2, in kJ.  Determine the amount of heat transfer during the reversible isothermal compression process from State 3 to State 4, in kJ.  Determine the net work output from the cycle, in kJ.   Please do NOT type.  Please write your detailed solutions on the exam paper.  Thank you.

Compare (similarities) and contrast (differences) the nervous system with the endocrine system. Suggestions: References to anatomy, mode of transport, speed of response, duration of response, amplitude vs. frequency modulated. Not all suggestions or terminology are required. Please make sure to demonstrate understanding of any terminology used. Proper usage of more basic terminology to demonstrate concept is highly encouraged over improper usage of more technical terminology. SIMPLE SENTENCES ARE YOUR FRIEND, but not mandatory.

After a person has ingested large amounts of sucrose (table sugar), the glucose and fructose that exceed caloric requirements are transformed to fatty acids for triacylglycerol synthesis. This fatty acid synthesis consumes Acetyl-CoA, ATP, and NADPH. How are these three substances produced from glucose?

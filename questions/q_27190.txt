Five springs, having stiffnesses k1 = 105 N/m, k2 = 2 x 105 N/m, k3 = 3 x 105 N/m, k4 = 4 x 105 N/m, and k5 = 5 x 105 N/m, are connected as a parallel-series system and are subjected to a load P = 1000 N at node 5.         Write the stiffness matrices for each of the elements (5 points) Using the assembly of elements, formulate the stiffness matrix of the structure WITHOUT CONSTRAINTS. (10 points) Write the stiffness matrix of the CONSTRAINED structure with the boundary conditions applied as indicated in the figure. (5 points) Determine the displacements of nodes 2, 3, and 4 using the finite element method. State the assumptions made in your solution (5 points)

Don't like Brussels sprouts? Blame your genes. The chemical PTC (phenylthiocarbamide), which is nearly identical to a compound found in the cabbage family, tastes very bitter for some people. Others cannot detect a taste. The ability to taste PTC is incompletely dominant and is controlled by a gene on chromosome 7. A woman who finds Brussel sprouts mildly distasteful (in other words, who can taste PTC weakly) has a child with a man who hates Brussel sprouts (in other words, who can taste PTC strongly). What is the probability that their son likes Brussel sprouts (in other words, cannot taste PTC)?

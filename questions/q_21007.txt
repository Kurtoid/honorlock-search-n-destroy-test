QUESTION 2    There are many types of locations where adventures can happen in D&D.  Two of those types of locations are dungeons and exotic locations. The player will role a dice to find out where they are off to to find their next location. You will complete the Locations App which will display a location dependent on a dice roll. Unfortunately the person who started the app was not very efficient. They have a static array declared and filled with strings in the following format: locationType, diceRoll, Description.    e.g. Exotic 1 Among the branches of a tree But there is a mix of 2 types of locations - Exotic and dungeons, and they are in no particular order. You may not change any of the existing code. Complete the Delphi project by following the instructions to create the app.    1) Right click on the button below to open the zip file in a new tab. Download it. Unzip it and rename the folder to include 'Q2' and your name.         (1)   2) Declare a global dynamic array of strings. (1)   3) Create a onClick procedure for the btnSelect button. Get the selected value from the TRadioGroup (rgpLocation). If it is exotic, the dynamic array will have 7 values; if it is dungeons it will hold 5 values. Copy only those locations for the specified location type. But, the dynamic array must not include the Location type in the string. Your code should be as generic as possible. The only thing that should change is the radio group and the length of the array, if I was to add other locations.  (10)   4) Create a onClick procedure for the btnDisplay button. Clear the TRichEdit (redDisplay). Then display the contents of the dynamic array, 1 string per line, in the richEdit (redDisplay), preceded by the position in the array (index) in brackets.   e.g. (0) 1 - Among the branches of a tree  Right click on the button to open the output in a new tab. The output is what must display after btnSelect and btnDisplay have been clicked.        (4)   5) Create a onClick procedure for the btnSort button, which sorts the dynamic array in increasing order. This should then have the locations in diceRoll order. Right click on the button to open the output in a new tab. The output is what must display after btnSelect, btnSort and  btnDisplay have been clicked.        (8)   6) Create a onClick procedure for the btnLocation button. It will obtain the diceRoll from the edit and then display the location string in the TRichedEdit. Right click on the button to open the output in a new tab. The output is what must display after btnSelect and btnLocation  have been clicked.        (5)   7) Create a onClick procedure for the btnLocate button. Get the value from the edtIncludes TEdit, and display all those locations from the dynamic array which includes the that word.  Right click on the button to open the output in a new tab. The output is what must display after btnSelect and btnLocate have been clicked.        (5)    TOTAL FOR QUESTION 2 [34]    TOTAL FOR TEST [45]

Dwight Hanes, a law student and amateur photographer, approaches Professor Teight Buns and offers him $100 to pose in Hanes underwear for a photo shoot. Hanes claims (falsely) that he is from the family that owns Hanes underwear, and he promises Professor Buns that the photos will be part of a calendar featuring a combination of fit male law professors and famous athletes wearing Hanes underwear. Hanes assures that the calendars will be print only, limited edition, and 100% of the proceeds will go to a scholarship fund for aspiring law students. Professor Buns reluctantly agrees to the photo shoot and poses on a fake bearskin rug. Before doing so, he signs, without reading, a contract with a clause stating that the written terms of the agreement constitute the entirety of the parties' agreement as to the subject matter and supersede all prior agreements, written or oral, relating to the subject matter. The written agreement states that the sole purpose of the agreement is to raise money for Hanes's photography business. Within hours of the shoot, images of Professor Buns in Hanes underwear go viral on the Internet. If he were to sue Dwight Hanes, would a court allow in evidence of Dwight's oral representations as to the purposes of the photo shoot?

You have a new client that has been administering moxidectin every 3 months for the last 5 years just like her feed store told her to do. She has called you because she started to see white worms in her horses' feces and she is worried that she should have been giving the dewormer more often. You explain her to her about the possibility of drug resistance but she doesn't believe you. So you suggest checking the egg count as numbers do not lie. She agrees. You take a collection of feces from multiple horses (a single group sample) that the client saw with white worms and perform a fecal egg count. You then have her give the anthelmintic and 2 weeks later get another sample. Here is the following information. Calculate the fecal egg reduction test and determine if resistance is present. Pre-drug FEC 800 epg 2 weeks post drug FEC 600 epg
Please use the following information to answer the following questions.You work for a company selling tropical rain forest plants commonly found in the understory of the forest. These plants are shade tolerant and can be grown indoors because they require low light. Your employer wants you to find out what is the best type of light to maximize growth of these understory plants. Using a full spectrum of natural light would cause these plants to die because they are a shade-tolerant plant species.From your biology class, you recall that the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis involve pigment molecules that absorb light of specific wavelengths. You also remember the experiments done by the German biologist Theodor Engelmann, in which he separated light using a prism into different wavelengths and then determined which wavelengths were best for promoting photosynthesis in the algae species he was examining. Your goal is to determine which wavelengths (colors) of light are best for promoting photosynthesis to enhance growth in your species of plant. To achieve this, you grew your plants under different wavelengths of light and measured their growth rates. The wavelengths were measured in nanometers (nm), and the growth rate was measured in millimeters per day (mm/day). The data you collected are as follows:WavelengthsGrowth400 nm0.33 mm/day450 nm0.46 mm/day500 nm0.88 mm/day550 nm0.12 mm/day600 nm0.54 mm/day650 nm0.28 mm/day700 nm0.08 mm/day750 nm0.00 mm/dayMake a bar graph plotting growth rates on the y-axis and wavelengths of light on the x-axis. Referring to your graph, answer the following questions:Which wavelength is best for your plants' growth?

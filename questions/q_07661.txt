Mrs. Close is teaching her students about the unique features' nonfiction books have that typically stories and poetry do not have. Which of the following is not a feature found in nonfiction books?
In a certain fruit fly species, wing shape is determined by a single gene with two alleles: (S) for straight wings, which is completely dominant to (s) for curly wings.  In turn, eye shape is determined by a single gene with two alleles: (R) for round eyes, which is completely dominant to (r) for triangular eyes.  The two genes are linked to the same autosome.  A cis dihybrid male fly (S s R r) is test crossed and the following progeny are obtained. Progeny phenotypes           Number of progeny Straight, round                        43 Straight, triangular                  4 Curly, round                             6 Curly, triangular                      47 Total                                          100 What is the centiMorgan (cM) map distance between these two genes?

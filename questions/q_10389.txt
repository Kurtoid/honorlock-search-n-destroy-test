Mannose is a naturally occurring sugar that is important to human metabolism. Mannose can exist in an open chain form (D-mannose) or can cyclize to form a cyclic structure (b-D-mannopyranose). Answer the questions below about D-mannose and b-D-mannopyranose.  Which of the Fischer projections (A-F) below represent D-mannose? [Fischer]  Which of the chair conformations (T-Z) below represent the MOST stable conformation of b-D-mannopyranose? [chair1] Which of the chair conformations (T-Z) below represent the LEAST stable conformation of b-D-mannopyranose? [chair2]  How many total possible stereoisomers are there for b-D-mannopyranose (including the one drawn)? [stereopyr] How many diastereomers are possible for D-mannose? [diasman] The anomeric center of a cyclic sugar is the newly formed chiral center resulting from the cyclization reaction. Which of the carbon atoms labeled 1-6 above is the anomeric center?

Hanski developed the incidence function model (IFM) for metapopulations by, in part, altering colonization and extinction probabilities of the Levin's Model to be a function of isolation and area, respectively. In doing so, this model allows investigators to fit data on presence/absence of species to interpret metapopulation dynamics.  Why did Hanski incorporate patch area into the model?

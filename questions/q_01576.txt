Provide an appropriate response.A human gene carries a certain disease from the mother to the child with a probability rate of 37%. That is, there is a 37% chance that the child becomes infected with the disease. Suppose a female carrier of the gene has five children. Assume that the infections of the five children are independent of one another. Find the probability that at least one of the children get the disease from their mother. Round to the nearest thousandth.

Researcher wanted to study calcium level for senior women (women older than 65 years old).  The distribution of calcium levels for a sample of 180 senior women followed a bell-shaped symmetric pattern, with the mean of 2.4 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) and standard deviation of 0.3 mmol/L.   Classify the following statement:  About 68% of sampled senior women have calcium levels between 2.1 and 3 mmol/L.

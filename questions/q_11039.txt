How many nitrogen atoms are in one molecule of (NH4)3Fe(CN)6?
Some proponents of entitlement-program reform suggest indexing Social Security benefits to the consumer price index (CPI)
True/False.  Enter T or F for statement.  (Do not enter the words "true" or "false".  Just the capital letter T or F)[1] Silicon atoms are covalently bonded to one another. [2] Doping increases the conductivity of silicon. [3] The width of the depletion region in a pn junction increases with reverse bias. [4] To produce power, a solar cell must be in forward bias. [5] LEDs emit light in equilibrium. [6] Zener diodes are useful for their forward-bias zeta voltages . [7] N-channel MOSFETS require negative VGS to turn on. [8] Large-amplitude ac input signals ensure linearization of an amplifier. [9] Thinking about Project 4 - Diodes, the measured reverse leakage currents for the various diodes reasonably matched the values reported in the respective datasheets. [10] Thinking about Project 5 - Diode Applications, the heartbeat detection circuit used an op amp to attenuate the signal from the infrared photodetector circuit.

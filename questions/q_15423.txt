Since 1995, the average annual rate of inflation across the entire Mexican economy has been 8% but, because of improvements in labor productivity within the manufacturing sector, the rate of inflation within the sector of the Mexican economy that produces traded goods has been only 3% per year. In the U.S., there has been a uniform rate of inflation throughout the economy of 2% per year. Given this information, which of the following statements is most consistent with PPP theory?

Consider the following LC-3 program that prompts for and echoes an inputted character (note the starting address): ; PROGRAM MODULE .ORIG x3010 LD R1, NEGlf LOOP LEA R0, PROMPT TRAP x22 LD R0, CHARqm TRAP x21 TRAP x20 ADD R2, R0, R1 BRz DONE TRAP x21 BRnzp LOOP DONE TRAP x25 .END Also consider the following additional LC-3 code that provides data for the program above: ; DATA MODULE .ORIG x3040 NEGlf .FILL xFFF6 PROMPT .STRINGZ "input" CHARqm .FILL x003F .END Complete the symbol table below for the code above. Enter the addresses as 4-digit hex values in LC-3 format like the following: x01F3       SYMBOL       ADDRESS      LOOP [loop]   DONE [done]   NEGlf [neglf]   PROMPT [prompt]   CHARqm [charqm]    LC-3 does not have a linker so assembling just the program module above will result in undefined symbol errors since some labels are external (i.e., they're defined in the data module). A linker is able to complete machine code for instructions that reference external symbols by calculating the correct PC offset using the information in the symbol table. What machine code would a linker create for the LD R1, NEGlf  instruction in the program above?Enter the machine code as 4-digit hex values in LC-3 format like the following: x01F3 [mc]

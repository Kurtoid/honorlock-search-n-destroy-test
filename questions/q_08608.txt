Skill B2.  For the situation in Skill B1, suppose that Rose will use a linear multiattribute utility function (w1 u1 + w2 u2) to model her preferences (u1 = utility for cost, u2 = utility for time).  She uses swing weighting to determine the weights on these attributes. The three hypothetical alternatives are H0 (every attribute has its worst value), H1 (best value of cost), and H2 (best value of time).  These have the following scores: 0, 100, 85. Determine values for the weights (w1 and w2) that are consistent with these scores.

Which of the following best describes an adulterant?
An object of mass of 2.0 kg hangs from an ideal massless spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m. An oscillating force F = (4.8 N) cos[(3.0 rad/s)t] is applied to the object. What is the amplitude of the resulting oscillations? You can neglect damping.
Software applications that mimic written or spoken human speech to simulate a conversation or interaction with a real person.
Natural concepts are created naturally through your experiences, and they can be developed from either direct or indirect experiences. For example, if you live in Essex Junction, Vermont, you probably have had a lot of direct experience with snow. If, however, you've lived your entire life on the island of Saint Vincent in the Caribbean, you may never have actually seen snow, much less tasted, smelled, or touched it. You know snow from the indirect experience of seeing pictures of snow. Either way, snow is a natural concept because you can construct an understanding of it through direct observations or indirect experiences of snow.

4.  The purpose of this problem is to show your understanding of a multiplicative linear congruential generator.  The problem will walk you through the steps necessary to produce the first two random numbers that would be generated by a multiplicative LCG with a modulus of 101, a multiplier of 12 and an initial seed of 5.  (Remember that the initial seed does not yield a random number directly.)  You may choose any value for c (the increment) that would be appropriate for a multiplicative linear congruential generator whose modulus is 101. a.  What value of c will you use?  [increment] b.  If S0 = 5, what is S1?  [S1] c.  Given your answer to part b, what is R1?  [R1] d.  Given the value you have for S1, what is S2?  [S2]

Because Leslie moved to Ottawa from Vancouver she had little time to find a nice place.  Knowing about the tight rental market she signed a lease on a "dump" of an apartment a month ago.  Her monthly rent is $1500 and she has 11 months to go before she can terminate her tenancy.  She can't imagine anyone wanting to take an assignment of her lease given the lack of maintenance and repair.  She can't bring herself to lie to any prospective assignee about the condition of the place.   Leslie is so frustrated with her living arrangements and she desperately wants out.  Yesterday she came home to an N13 in her mailbox and a letter from a new owner advising that major renovations would be starting next month in the residential complex (though not on her wing for another 4 to 5 months) which are expected to continue for the next 24 months in phases.  The new owner apologized for the disruption.  Leslie is distraught, as the N13 terminates her tenancy in 11 months which is when she planned to leave anyway!  What realistic options does Leslie have to get out asap?  Her best friend from Vancouver also just moved to Ottawa and has a beautiful 2 bedroom condo and has asked her to move in asap.

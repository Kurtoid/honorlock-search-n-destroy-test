Suppose that you obtained data by taking a random sample from a population and that you intend to find a confidence interval for the population mean. Answer True or False to the following questions. a. Increasing the confidence level from 95% to 99% will decrease the margin of error.  [a1] b. The sample mean is resistant to outliers, so the presence of outliers will have little effect on the confidence interval.  [a2] c. For a large sample size, the sample mean is approximately normally distributed, regardless of the distribution of the variable under consideration.  [a3] d. The t-interval procedure is robust to moderate violations of the normality assumption.  [a4]

Use the following memo from Writing Help Central.   MEMORANDUM   DATE:  September 30, 2017   FROM: Meridith Bronson   TO:       Franco Marconi, Director, Research Programs   SUBJECT: Commendation - Henry Stapleton - Transport Demand Project   The purpose of this is to officially commend Henry Stapleton for his exceptional contribution throughout his assignment to the Transport Demand Project (TDP).   As you know, Henry has been working on special assignment with the TDP team for the past eight months. Now that he is about to return to your part of the organization I wanted to make sure that he gets some recognition for his significant and exceptional contributions to the project.   As a junior econometrician, Henry's role in the project was pivotal to its timely and successful completion. It was Henry who worked long hours, numerous nights and weekends with his small team of researchers, first specifying, and then testing the thousands of equations that had to be run. The quality of Henry's written work was also exceptional. His regression analysis summaries were always very well written and rarely required revision.   As a colleague and project team member, Henry was also outstanding. His upbeat enthusiasm for the project was infectious, and he seemed to motivate the entire project team. He was very well-liked by all team members, and in effect he became "unofficial" deputy project manager.   In closing, I would like to say that I have worked with many junior economists and econometricians over the years and have never run across one as professional and productive as Henry Stapleton was on the TDP. I believe that the organization as a whole should recognize his exceptional contribution to a major project.   Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

A police detective was investigating several thefts of laptops and other electronic items from a computer store. He believed that one or more employees were involved in these thefts. While investigating one of the store's managers, the detective went to the dorm room of the manager's daughter. He improperly talked the dorm's resident adviser into opening the door to the room, and he searched it. The detective saw a new laptop on the daughter's desk and next to it was an opened birthday card signed by the manager. Written on the card was, "Like I told you before, don't tell anyone that you got this from me; we could get into a lot of trouble." The daughter returned from class, and the detective immediately placed the daughter under arrest as an accessory to the computer store theft. Based on the evidence obtained from the dorm room, a search warrant was issued for the manager's apartment. The search yielded more brand new electronic items from the computer store. The manager was arrested and charged with theft. At the manager's trial, his attorney files a motion to suppress the evidence consisting of the daughter's laptop and birthday card and the items seized from the manager's apartment. How should the court rule on the motion?

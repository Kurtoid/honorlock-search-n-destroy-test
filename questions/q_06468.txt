The parents of a 3-year-old child are concerned that the child has begun refusing usual foods and wants to eat mashed potatoes and chicken strips at every meal and snack. The child's rate of weight has slowed, but the child remains at the same percentile for weight on a growth chart. What will the primary care pediatric nurse practitioner tell the parents to do? Correct Answer: Place a variety of nutritious foods on the child's plate at each meal. Young children should have three meals and two nutritious snacks each day. The parents' responsibility is to provide nutritious foods and allow children to choose how much they will eat. Children who are allowed to choose foods will likely make selections that are not healthy. Parents should be discouraged from preparing separate meals for their children. Snacks are necessary to maintain adequate intake and energy.

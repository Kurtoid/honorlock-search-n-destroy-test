Kidneys and Fluid Balance Hybrid : When we have a decrease in osmolarity of the extracellular fluid the integrated response includes a/n [52](52: A or B) in ADH release which primarily leads to [53](53: S-W). ADH has its effects by acting on the[54](54: portion of the nephron). We also see a/n [55](55: A or B) in renin release which indirectly leads to the release of a hormone from the adrenal cortex called: [56](56), this hormone acts on the [57](57: Part of nephron) and leads to [58](58: V or W-Effect on Na+) and [59](59: R or S-Effect on K+). In the end we have a [60](60: A or B) in total body fluid and a [61](61: A or B) in total body sodium. The counter-current multiplier mechanism involves the Loop of Henle in the nephron. When the filtrate is going through the [62](62) portion of the loop water is reabsorbed leading to a/n[63](63) in osmolarity deep in the medulla of the kidney. As the filtrate passes through the[64](64) portion of the loop Na+is reabsorbed leading to no permanent change in osmolarity of the filtrate in the loop of Henle. The water and Na+that are pulled out of the filtrate around the loop of Henle must be brought back into the vascular system and this is accomplished by a specialized capillary network around the loop called the[65](65). After the loop of Henle the next portion of the nephron the filtrate passes through is called the [66](66). Next, the filtrate gets to the [67](67: portion of the nephron) and the osmotic pressure in the interstitial space that was created by the loop of Henle and the counter-current multiplier mechanism leads to [68](68: R-V) which leads to a/n permanent [69](69: A or B) in the concentration of the urine.       A. Increase   F. Descending   K. Peritubular capillaries   P. ADH   U. Less water reabsorption     B. Decrease   G. Loop of Henle   L. Renal capillaries   Q. ANP   V. More Na+ reabsorption     C. Bowman's capsule   H. Distal tubule   M. Aldosterone   R. More K+ secretion   W. Less Na+ reabsorption     D. Collecting duct   I. Proximal tubule   N. Angiotensin II   S. Less K+ secretion         E. Ascending   J. Vasa recta   O. Cortisol   T. More water reabsorption

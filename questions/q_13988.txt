To get full credit, make sure that you redraw the circuit on your own paper, choose and draw the direction of the current through the 15 and 20 ohm resistors.

You've found two advertisements for potential roommates, and now you need to choose. Read the following advertisements.     Anuncio de estudiante 1 Busco companero/a para compartir una casa o un apartamento. Estoy en mi segundo ano (sophomore) de universidad, y estudio ciencias politicas. Soy una estudiante de la escuela de honor, muy responsable, y siempre saco A en mis clases porque estudio 6 horas todos los dias. Nunca miro la television y no me gustan los videojuegos, asi que no hago ruido (make noise). Me gustan la limpieza, el orden y el silencio. Soy vegetariana, y alergica al pelo de los perros y gatos. Tengo pocos amigos y no salgo mucho. Prefiero leer o ver peliculas en Netflix para divertirme. Tambien voy al gimnasio todas las mananas a las 7. Me encanta jugar al tenis y sacar fotos.           Anuncio de estudiante 2 Busco companero/a para compartir una casa o un apartamento. Estoy en mi tercer ano (junior) de universidad, y estudio administracion de empresas. Tambien trabajo en un restaurante tres dias a la semana. Los fines de semana, me gusta salir con mis amigos o hacer fiestas en casa. Soy una persona activa, simpatica, y comica. Generalmente, me levanto a las 11, porque estudio por la noche. Despues de levantarme, voy a trabajar, y por la tarde voy a mis clases. Con frecuencia, me acuesto a las 3 o las 4. Me encanta jugar videojuegos en mi XBox y canto en un grupo de rap. No me gusta practicar deportes, pero corro todos los dias.     Now, choose a roommate, and write an email to him/her*. In your email, you'll want to make sure to clarify your expectations and to ask your roommate some questions. See the guide below to help you--though these are just some ideas (you should consider your own). Use as much detail as possible and be creative.**  Begin your email--why are you writing? How is this person similar or different to you? What chores do you want your roommate to do? In discussion chores, how might you describe your home/apartment/dorm? What do you want your roommate to do to help you stay healthy? How can this person arrive to your apartment/home from the airport? What would you recommend to be a successful student? For fun on campus, in Starkville, or nearby? How might you end your email?  *If you need an accented letter or other special character in your answer, copy and paste the character you need from this list into the answer box: a e i o u u n A E I O U ! ? **DO NOT use an online translator! It is very obvious, and sometimes Canvas even tells me which translator you used. I do not expect you all to be fluent and perfect in your writing at this point. I DO expect you to use the Spanish you have learned up until this point to complete this assignment.

Male dung beetles have a wide range of horn sizes and shapes, which are influenced by the amount of dung (feces) they consume during larval stages. Larger males, which consumed loads of dung develop very large horns, while smaller males develop small horns or have no horns at all. The size of the horns has been shown to be mediated in part by the differential expression of the receptor Notch, which binds to a membrane-bound ligand (Delta) in adjacent cells. This is an example of _____.

A steam engine runs on the Rankine cycle. The steam leaves the boiler at 20 bar and 250 oC. The turbine has an efficiency of 75% and an outlet pressure of 0.5 bar. Pressure changes in the boiler and condenser can be considered negligible and the liquid leaving the condenser is saturated. What is the efficiency of this Rankine cycle?

Assume that a class called Student, with a data attribute called yearOfAdmission (an integer), has already been declared. Assume that the Student class provides a getter method getYearOfAdmission for its data attribute. Further assume that a variable called learner has been declared and created in the main method of a driver program, using an appropriate constructor of the Student class, and that the student's year of admission has already been set to an appropriate value. Write code for the main method of the driver that retrieves the student's year of admission and then prints the student's years in college (as an integer) as of this year.  Hint: declare an integer variable called currentYear with a value of 2021 for calculation purposes.

The following problem will be used to answer the next question.Tech Engineering Company is considering the purchase of a new machine to replace an existing one.  The old machine was purchases 4 years ago at a cost of $8,000, and was being depreciated over 8 years using straight line depreciation to a SV of 0.  The current market value of the old machine is $5,000.  The new machine falls into the MACRS 5-year class, has an estimated life of 5 years, it costs $100,000, and Tech plans to sell the machine at the end of the fifth year for $20,000.  The new machine is expected to generate sales of $30,000 per year as well as providing a cost savings of $10,000 per year.  In addition, the company will need to increase inventory by $10,000.  The company's tax rate is 20 percent.  (Numbers in parentheses are negative) What would be the operating cash flow in year 1 (t=1)?

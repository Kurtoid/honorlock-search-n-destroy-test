Mr. B.A. Betterbreeder, the manager of a 200-boar Gene Transfer Center that belongs to your best client, has raised concerns about the number of young replacement (6-month old) boars that his employees are tasked with getting trained during the isolation period.  Too many young boars that are not yet trained are coming over to the main GTC from the isolation facility.  He believes the boars are close but not quite ready to work.  Because of high customer demand for the liquid genetics produced in his facility, he really needs the boars to be willing to "jump the dummy" when they come into the main facility.  He wants to know if there is a pharmaceutical solution that will help with his problem.  You tell him to have the trainers inject the boars about 10 minutes prior to the training sessions with 20 mg of:

If you want to write a matrix in your work, say   just type in like this: (1 2 3)(4 5 6) Press Shift + Enter to minimize the gap between lines. Say, if you want to type in a vector, say something like   simply do (1)       (5)(2)  +   (6)(3)       (7)(4)       (8) In addition, if you want to type in a subscript, you can use the underscore _ sign e.g. P_B for the conventional change of basis matrix notation.

Read the following passage from "What Is the Nature of Learning?"  Then, based on your reading of the passage, choose the most appropriate answer to the question that follows the passage.  What Is the Nature of Learning? To begin with, it is important to recognize that learning is work. Sometimes it is easy and sometimes it is difficult, but there is always work involved. For many years people made the error of assuming that learning was a passive activity that involved little more than just absorbing information. Learning was thought to be a lot like copying and pasting words in a document; the student's mind was blank and ready for an instructor to teach them facts that they could quickly take in. As it turns out, learning is much more than that. In fact, at its most rudimentary level, it is an actual process that physically changes our brains. Even something as simple as learning the meaning of a new word requires the physical alteration of neurons and the creation of new paths to receptors. These new electrochemical pathways are formed and strengthened as we utilize, practice, or remember what we have learned. If the new skill or knowledge is used in conjunction with other things we have already learned, completely different sections of the brain, our nerves, or our muscles may be tied in as a part of the process. A good example of this would be studying a painting or drawing that depicts a scene from a story or play you are already familiar with. Adding additional connections, memories, and mental associations to things you already know something about expands your knowledge and understanding in a way that cannot be reversed. In essence, it can be said that every time we learn something new we are no longer the same. In addition to the physical transformation that takes place during learning, there are also a number of other factors that can influence how easy or how difficult learning something can be. While most people would assume that the ease or difficulty would really depend on what is being learned, there are actually several other factors that play a greater role. In fact, research has shown that one of the most influential factors in learning is a clear understanding about learning itself. This is not to say that you need to become neuroscientists in order to do well in school, but instead, knowing a thing or two about learning and how we learn in general can have strong, positive results for your own learning. This is called metacognition (i.e., thinking about thinking). Some of the benefits to how we learn can be broken down into different areas such as  attitude and motivation toward learning, types of learning, methods of learning, and your own preferences for learning.

Show work on your paper and submit on the last problem of this test.                                             g(x) = x3 + x2 - 7x + 65 Find all zeros of the polynomial (give exact values - no decimals). Show work if synthetic division was needed. List multiple zeros in each of the categories: rational first, irrational and complex. If there are none in any of these three categories, write "none" in all lower case.a) rational zeros (least to greatest with commas and no spaces): [x] b) irrational zeros (list negative before positive and use sqrt to designate square root symbol. Put commas between with no spaces.  Example: 2-sqrt(3),2+sqrt(3) ):    [y] c) complex zeros (List complex conjugates separately using "i" and listing the one with a negative imaginary part first and then the other that has a positive imaginary part.  Example: 1-5i,1+5i ): [z]d) on your work paper, write g(x) as a product of linear factors.

Use the following diagram and description to answer the question below. In a particular plant, leaf color is controlled by gene D. Plants with the dominant allele D have dark green leaves, and plants with the homozygous recessive dd genotype have light green leaves. A true-breeding dark-leaved plant is crossed with a light-leaved one, and the F1 offspring is allowed to self-pollinate. The predicted outcome of this cross is diagrammed in the Punnett square shown below, where 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the genotypes corresponding to each box within the square.  Which of the boxes correspond to plants with a heterozygous genotype?

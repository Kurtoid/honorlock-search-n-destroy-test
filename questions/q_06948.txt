Object-Orientation and UML Class Diagrams:  A human resource application contains three classes: Technician (hourly temp worker), Administrative Assistant (full-time employee), and Manager (full-time employee). A Technician is paid on an hourly basis, works less than 35 hours per week, and has no company benefits, such as vacation and sick time, paid holidays, and unemployment compensation. Full-time employees work for 40 hours and are paid every month. They have vacation and sick time, paid holidays, and unemployment compensation. Managers can manage other employees (technicians, administrative assistants, and lower-level managers). The goal of this exercise is to identify an appropriate superclass for these three classes and two polymorphic operations that should be included in this superclass. The implementation details of these operations will be different in each subclass. To further differentiate the behavior of the subclasses, there may also be an operation that is present only in some (possibly just one) of the subclasses, but not all. Answer the questions below:   Name the superclass: [1 point]   Name two polymorphic operations that will have different behaviors in each subclass. Provide a separate description of the behavior of each operation in each class: [2 points]   Identify one operation that might be present in only some of the subclasses (not all) and state what it does. [1 point]   Represent the superclass, the three classes (Technician, AdministrativeAssistant, and Manager) and the operations that you identified in parts 2 and 3 in a UML class diagram. [10 points]

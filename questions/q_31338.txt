Copy and paste the provided chart into the answer field below.    Verbal Statement Symbolic Statement using z-scores (Part B) Probability (Part C)     the probability x is no more than a      the probability x is at least b      the probability x is between a and b       B) Assume that the monthly milk production of Holstein cows is normally distributed, with the mean and standard deviation as determined ini #1A). Translate each verbal statement into symbolic form using z-scores. Enter your response into the copied chart using correct mathematical notation. C) Select Stat CalculatorsNormal. Then, setting the mean to 0 and standard deviation to 1, determine the probabilities for the statements in part B).  Enter the probability, correct to four decimal places, into the copied chart.

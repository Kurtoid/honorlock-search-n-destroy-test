8. Consider a walkup service center that is modeled by an M/M/1 queuing system (Poisson arrivals and exponential service times), where the average service time is 85 seconds. Customer inter-arrival times are currently on the increase, and management will add a second server once average waiting time in the queue reaches 8 minutes. What is the average inter-arrival time (in seconds to two decimal places to the right of the decimal point) that will result in an average waiting time in the queue of 8 minutes for this M/M/1 system, thereby creating the need for a second server? Show all work.

Consider the schematic depicting an inviscid flow of air moving through a two-dimensional bend along a streamline that passes through points 1 and 2 as shown in Figure 1. The radius of curvature for all points is R = 3.5 m. Assume a steady flow of air that is incompressible at standard conditions.   Figure 1. Determine the following:  The steamline and normal components of acceleration at points 1 and 2 in m/s2; the pressure gradients along the streamline at points 1 and 2 in Pa/m; and the pressure gradient normal to the streamline at points 1 and 3 in Pa/m.

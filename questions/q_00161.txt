[Be sure to show all work.  When doing calculations, start with the symbolic equation(s) from the equation sheet, written down just as they are on the equation sheet and then progressing from there to a solution.] An arrow is shot at an unknown speed horizontally from a height of 1.5 m.  The arrow strikes the ground with a velocity of 24.0 m/s at an angle 13 degrees below horizontal.  A student is asked to use the above information to find a) the time in the air, b) the velocity of the arrow when it had been in the air for half of the total time of flight, and c) the Range.  Analyze the student's solution below.  Type 1-2 sentences into the box below about each error you see in the student's solution, describing why what they did was wrong and what they should have done instead.  On this problem, you earn points by explaining what the student's mistakes were and how to fix them (not by solving the problem yourself, though you may wish to do that to help you find the mistakes).

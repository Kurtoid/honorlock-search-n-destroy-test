Let   (a)  Which subcollection of discrete random variables does    belong to?  What are the values of its parameters? [2 points] (b)  Given that the first    sales were failed sales, find the probability that there will be at least    more failed sales before a successful sale. [4 points] (c)  Find the expected value and variance of the total number of customers the saleswoman has to approach. [4 points]

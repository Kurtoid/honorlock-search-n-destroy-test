Professor Hosmer announced to her PSYCH 2001 class that she was conducting an experiment on procrastination and that students could volunteer during her office hours. Over the next few weeks, many students visited his office and expressed an interest to participate. Dr. Hosmer compiled the subject list once she had enough volunteers. She placed participants on the top half of the list into a Public Goal Group and participants on the bottom half of the list into a Private Goal Group. Both groups attended five weekly sessions with other group members to hear lectures and watch films on time management strategies. Group differences centered on expressing (verbally stating aloud) three goals to complete before the next session with the other members present and report back to the class on whether or not the goals were met (Public Goal Group). Further, participants in the Private Goal Group set three weekly goals for themselves, but they wrote them on a sheet of paper and neither announced them aloud nor reported to the class about their success. All subjects recorded the number of goals completed each week. After examining the percentage of goals achieved and calculating group means, Professor Hosmer concluded that public goal setting is superior to private goal setting. A. Is this experiment is internally valid? B. If this experiment is not internally valid, and what is (are) the source(s) of threat(s)?

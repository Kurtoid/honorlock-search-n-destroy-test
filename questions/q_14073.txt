You completed a work sampling study with a total of 120 observations on worker performance. Among these observations, the worker was found to be active 70 times. The total time for your study was 4800 min. During this period, the worker produced 2000 units.   (15pts) What is the actual worker activity time required to produce a single unit? If the average performance rating for the worker was 102%, what is the normal work time per piece? If the allowance provided to each worker by the company is 15%, what is the standard work time per piece?  (5 pts) Given the good performance rating and high allowances provided by the company, provide one reason why it would be reasonable to see the relatively low proportion of activity time observed during the study. [Hint: consider factors the factors that are considered in allowances and the ergonomic aspects of work].

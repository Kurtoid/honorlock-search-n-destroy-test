The billboard weighs 8 kip and is supported by a structural tube that has 15 in outer diameter and wall thickness 0.5 in.  If pressure due to wind exerts a resultant force of 3 kip at the center of the billboard, determine the normal and shear stresses at H. Normal stress at H due to bending is [sigma] psi. Important note:  The origin is located at the base of the tube on the axis, and H is located on the outer surface of the tube, 2 ft above the X axis.

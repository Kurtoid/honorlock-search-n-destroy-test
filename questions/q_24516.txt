Use the following business letter from Writing Help Central.   July 20, 2015   Mr. Rodney GilesManager, Customer SupportInter-Office Solutions Inc.1289 Luxor Station Rd.Cedar Springs, IL, 34985 Dear Rodney:This is to further our meeting of last week at which we agreed to hold a series of meetings over the next two months to review your experiences with the pilot implementation of the 1to1 Customer Relationship Management Program.As discussed at that meeting, the objectives of our review sessions will be to:  Review and assess the overall effectiveness of the program; Identify and document strengths weaknesses of the program; Propose customer-focused solutions to address areas of weakness; Develop an approach and action plan for Phase 2 of the project; Determine the staff members who will make up the Phase 2 Team.  As agreed, meetings will be held every second Tuesday from 9:00 a.m. until noon, and the location will alternate between our two offices, the first one to be convened here at Inter-Office on August 14, 2015. Fred Johnson of your CRM group is to act as the meeting co-ordinator and recording secretary throughout the process.As discussed, at the end of the process, Deborah Buxton of Consultek will draft the summary report for review by the steering committee. As you requested, a copy of her c.v. has been enclosed.I trust I have covered all of the points that we discussed. If you have any questions or would like to add anything please give me a call at 745-9878. We look forward to seeing you at the August 14th meeting.Sincerely,Marilyn FrenchSenior Consultant Fred Johnson is involved in the process to:
At which step in the diagram are spores being produced?
Time-sharing, for computers, means:
For this exam, you will be exploring weekly aggregated values of the DOW index from the beginning of 2010 through the end of 2020. Please use the provided starter script to begin the data analysis. Additionally you will find included a script containing a few helper functions that may prove useful. It is entirely optional to use them. Additionally, you may refer to any course notes or example code. Please read the open-book policy document to better understand what it allowed and not allowed during this exam. Analysis should be done on the 'train' data except for comparing ARIMA forecasts in question 2, when you will be using the 'test' data. MT Starter Code.R   Midterm Helper Code.R   Additional reminder to watch the time carefully and make sure you submit before it closes. Data: DJI.csv   Question 1: Data Exploration (25 Points)  Produce time series and ACF plots for the original series as well as the first and second differences. What assumptions (if any) does each level of differencing appear to violate, and which seems closest to stationary? Comment if any features stand out. Fit a third order parametric polynomial (cubed) and a splines model on the first difference of the data. Extract the residuals of each model and use graphical residual analysis to evaluate the goodness of fit. Also apply performance measurements (MAPE, Precision Measure, and MSE) to assess the performance of the prediction. Now fit a third order parametric polynomial, but also include a second order harmonic component. Assess the fit in the same way as in 1(B) above; does the quality of the fit seem to be improved? How about the predictions? What do the results seem to indicate?    Question 2: ARIMA Modelling and Forecasting (45 Points)  On each level of differencing, now build the PACF plots. When considered along with the plots from before, what (if anything) can you say about the potential order of the ARIMA model? Using the iterative AIC minimization process with a maximum order of (4,2,4), determine the non-trivial (at least one coefficient) orders associated with the lowest and second lowest AIC scores. Fit models with both orders and use Box tests and appropriate graphical analysis to assess the quality of the fits. Perform root analysis of both models (graphically or algebraically) and comment on the properties of the processes. Write out the algebraic function associated with the model that has the lowest AIC score, include a model summary for verification purposes. For the same model, forecast ahead 6 points and overlay the values with confidence intervals on top of the plot for the data of the same period. Calculate forecast accuracy metrics PM, MAE, and MAPE and comment on the prediction performance. Does ARIMA seem like a good method of modelling a financial index like the DOW? Why or why not?

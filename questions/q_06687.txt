A different study using the Perceived Quality of Residential Care Scale (scale described in Q.27) aimed to explore what factors relate to the higher perceived quality of care among residents of in-home care versus nursing home care. The researchers found that when holding health status constant, the type of care (in home vs. nursing home) determines individuals' level of autonomy, which in turn leads to higher perceived quality of care. The researchers also discovered that the relationships between type of care and perceived quality of residential care is much stronger for female than male residents.  In the text block below, identify the role of each of the following variables in this study (e.g. independent variable, dependent variable, control variable, moderating variable or mediating variable) a.

Experiments on learning in animals sometimes measure how long it takes for a mouse to find its way through a maze. The mean time is 18 seconds for one particular maze.  A researcher claims that a loud noise will cause the mice to complete the maze faster.  This researcher decides to measure how long each of 9 sampled mice takes to complete the maze with a noise as stimulus.  Assume the distribution of completion times with a noise as stimulus follows a Normal distribution with the standard deviation of 2 seconds.  The sample mean time to complete the maze for these sampled 9 mice was 17 seconds.  At 5% significance level, is there evidence to support the researcher's claim?  Find the p-value (use the calculator).

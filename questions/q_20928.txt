4.  The purpose of this problem is to show your understanding of a multiplicative linear congruential generator.  The problem will walk you through the steps necessary to produce the first two random numbers that would be generated by a multiplicative LCG with a modulus of 97, a multiplier of 10 and an initial seed of 5.  (Remember that the initial seed does not yield a random number directly.)  You may choose any value for c (the increment) that would be appropriate for a multiplicative linear congruential generator whose modulus is 97. a.  What value of c will you use?  [increment] b.

The nurse administers nicotinic acid (Niacin), a lipid-lowering medication, to a client. Which side effect does the nurse anticipate after administration of the nicotinic acid?
BONUS (5 points)Does treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function following a heart attack?  The table below provides summary statistics for an experiment to test ESCs in sheep that had a heart attack.  Each of these sheep was randomly assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts' pumping capacity was measured in the study.  A positive value corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which generally suggests a stronger recovery.     n x - bar s   ESCs 9 3.50 5.17   control 9 -4.33 2.76    The point estimate for the difference is 7.83 and standard error is computed at 1.95. Find the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval.  Show your work to receive full extra credit.
A blood sample in a red-stoppered tube is delivered to the lab for electrolytes, calcium, and phosphorus analysis. The tube is approximately half full and is accompanied by a purple top EDTA tube for a CBC that is approximately three quarters full. The chemistry results are as follows: Na = 135 mmol/LK = 11.3 mmol/LCl = 103 mmol/LTot CO2 = 14 mmol/LCa = 2.6 mg/dLPhos = 3.8 mg/dL

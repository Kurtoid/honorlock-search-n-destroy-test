Six hours later, she was tried on Pitocin augmentation via IV in the hand and within the hour progressed to complete dilation and began pushing. She pushed for two hours and was unable to progress satisfactorily due to arrested active phase of labor. She was taken to surgery, where a repeat low transverse cervical cesarean section was performed for obstructed labor due to cephalopelvic disproportion.

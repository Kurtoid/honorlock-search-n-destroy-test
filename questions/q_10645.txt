Shannon's parents, Richard and Susan, have recently divorced.  Richard and Susan argued frequently before, during and after the divorce.  According to the _____________ perspective, Richard and Susan's behaviors will be responsible for the lowered well-being of their child, Shannon.
Aleyrodidae are common pest insects found on cotton, tomato, poinsettia, and many other plants. Nymphs are translucent and mostly sessile, feeding on their host plant's phloem (sap) from the undersides of leaves. They undergo incomplete metamorphosis into winged adults. Because the nymphs cannot escape predation by moving, you hypothesize that their translucent ( semitransparent) bodies make them hard to spot by predators. How could you directly test this hypothesis?
22) If FSH begins to increase at days 26-28 of an ovarian cycle, this would mean what? A. LH is providing positive feedback to FSH. B. Progesterone is inclining. C. Pregnancy has occurred. D. Estrogen is declining.
Why would the Bumblebee want to look like the Yellow Jacket Wasp?
A 1.00-kg hollow cylinder of inner radius R1=10.0 cm and outer radius R2=30.0 cm is attached to a frictionless axis with four very light spikes as shown in the figure above. The cylinder is spinning with an angular velocity 6.00 rad/s in the direction shown. A small piece of clay with mass m=100 g is thrown toward the cylinder with velocity v=5.00 m/s; it hits the cylinder at a distance d=20.0 cm from its center at an angle theta of 70.0 o with respect to the radial line.  The clay sticks to the cylinder. a)(3p) Find the angular momentum of the cylinder before the clay hits it. Show work and remember to specify the units. b)(3p) Find the angular momentum of the clay with respect to the axis of rotation of the cylinder before the clay hits the cylinder. Show work and remember to specify the units. c) (1p) Is angular momentum of the cylinder-clay system is conserved during the collision? (yes or no) d) (1p) Is linear momentum of the cylinder-clay system is conserved during the collision? (yes or no) e) (7p) Find the angular speed of the cylinder after the clay hits it and sticks to it. Show work and remember to specify the units in your final answer. f) (5p) Find the amount of kinetic energy of clay-cylinder system lost in this collision. Show work and remember to specify units in your final answer.

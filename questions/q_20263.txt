VRAAG 1: Lees (read) die teks en beantwoord (answer) die vrae.          TEKS A         Interessante feite oor die kangaroe  Click on the button below to open TEXT A in a new tab:      1   Kangaroes kom net in Australie voor. Hulle vreet gras en beweeg (move) deur te hop. Hulle is blitsvinnig - tussen 60 tot 70km per uur - amper net so vinnig soos 'n perd (horse)! Hulle kan tot 3m hoog spring (jump).     2   Kangaroes gebruik hulle voortande (front teeth) om hul kos te kou (chew). Elke keer wanneer daardie tande stomp (blunt) raak, val hulle uit en die volgende (next) paar tande skuif vorentoe (to the front). Wanneer 'n kangaroe 20 jaar oud is, gebruik hy sy laaste (last) stel tande om mee te eet.     3   Die sakkie (little bag) op vroulike kangaroes, word 'n "buidel" genoem. Sy dra (carries) haar babatjie daarin. Ons noem 'n baba kangaroe in Engels 'n "joey". Wanneer 'n kangaroe swanger (pregnant) raak, dra sy die baba net 33 dae (days) lank in haar baarmoeder (womb), dan word hy gebore (born). Met geboorte lyk hy baie vreemd (funny)!     4   Hy is net 3cm lank en lyk soos 'n pienk wurm (worm)! Sy voorpote (front paws) is sterk genoeg dat hy in sy mamma se buidel kan klim waar hy dan vir meer as (more than) ses maande lank sal bly. Dis heerlik knus (comfy) daar binne en hy groei (grows) terwyl hy sy mamma se melk drink. Hy bly in sy sakhuisie tot hy oud genoeg is om vir homself te sorg (take care of himself). Wat 'n wonderlike (wonderful) ma is die kangaroe nie!         Bron: Verwerk uit die Reenboogreeks Graad 5                Aantal woorde: 204 (Engels uitgesluit)

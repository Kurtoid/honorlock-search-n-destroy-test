The deadly Ebola virus is a threat to both people and gorillas in Central Africa.   An outbreak in 2002 and 2003 killed 91 of the 95 gorillas in seven home ranges in the Congo.   To study the spread of the virus, measure "distance" by the number of home ranges separating a group of gorillas from the first group infected.   Here are data on distance and time in number of days until deaths began in each later group.     Distance, H (home ranges)  Time, D  (days)    1 3 4 4 4 5   4 21 33 41 43 46     To determine if there is an association between the number of home ranges, H, separating a group of gorillas from the first group infected and the number of days, D, until deaths began in the later group, consider a scatterplot of the data.   Use distance as the explanatory variable.   State whether the direction is negative, positive or no direction.  Give the direction of the plot, and then find the correlation between H and D to the nearest thousandth. The direction of the plot is [direction].       The correlation between H and D is [correlation].

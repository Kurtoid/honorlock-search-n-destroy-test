Latency Reduction in RPC Your co-worker came up with a design for a Network Interface Card (NIC) that does scatter/gather DMA.  That is, it is possible to give the DMA controller a tuple in the form: {(memory address, length), (memory address, length), (memory address, length), ...}.  The NIC's DMA engine will then do the needful to transfer the packet on to the network. You are using this DMA controller to implement an efficient RPC package at the user level.  Give a sketch of your design that minimizes the number of copies for marshalling the arguments from the client.  (It is sufficient to show client-side marshalling).

White-box testing:  Consider the problem of making n cents change with quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies using the least total number of coins. Assume that the supply of each denomination is large enough to satisfy every request for change. Suppose that for a given currency, the array C[0,...,r1] represents the values of the denominations of coins, where C[0] > C[1] > ... > C[r1], and r is the number of types of denominations. For example, for US coins, you have quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, and thus C = [25, 10, 5, 1] Let the array N[0,...,r1] be the output. It represents the number of coins for the corresponding denominations to be dispensed. If you had to make change for n=41, then the array N =[1,1,1,1]. The following code implements a greedy algorithm for making change. 0.    r = 4; 1.    C = {25, 10, 5, 1}; 2.    N = {0, 0, 0, 0}; 3.    read (n); 4a.  for (i = 0;             4b. i= C[i]) { 6.                      N[i] = N[i] + 1; 7.                      n = n - C[i]; 8.         } 9. }     Draw a control-flow graph of the above program. Label the nodes so that it is clear what statement(s) each node represents. Label the edges in a branch with True or False annotations. [15 points]   Consider a test input where n = 0. Identify from the control-flow graph which nodes and edges are executed and list them. [5 points]   Write additional test inputs to cover the remaining nodes and edges. For each test input, list only the new nodes and edges that are covered with each test. If you feel that a certain edge cannot be covered (i.e., the edge is infeasible), please provide an explanation. [5 points]

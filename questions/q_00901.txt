The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a process which generates random outcomes. The sample space is denoted S. All outcomes in S are equally likely.             Flip three coins. We can order the coins by using distinct fair coins The possible outcomes are: S = {(H,H,H), (H,H,T), (H,T,H), (T,H,H), (H,T,T), (T,H,T), (T,T,H), (T,T,T)}. These eight outcomes constitute the sample space. Consider the the events:   A = {Get a T on the first coin.}= {(T,H,H), (T,H,T), (T,T,H), (T,T,T)} Calculate the   probability Pr (A).

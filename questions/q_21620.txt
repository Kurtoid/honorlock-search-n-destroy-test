While collecting samples from a population that is known to be normal, we collect 25 data points. Suppose we observe that the mean of the population is 25 inches with a standard deviation is 5.  If we were to take 25 samples repeatedly and then calculate the means of the samples, what would be the expected std dev of those means?
4.  The purpose of this problem is to show your understanding of a multiplicative linear congruential generator.  The problem will walk you through the steps necessary to produce the first two random numbers that would be generated by a multiplicative LCG with a modulus of 83, a multiplier of 15 and an initial seed of 3.  (Remember that the initial seed does not yield a random number directly.)  You may choose any value for c (the increment) that would be appropriate for a multiplicative linear congruential generator whose modulus is 83. a.  What value of c will you use?  [increment] b.  If S0 = 3, what is S1?  [S1] c.  If S0 = 3, what is R1?  [R1] d.  If S0 = 3, what is S2?  [S2]

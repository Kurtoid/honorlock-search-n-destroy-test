EssayRecommended time: 15 minutesChoose ONE of the following questions and write an essay in which you incorporate materials from lecture and course readings, as they apply. Before writing, you may want to pause to outline the major points of your essay. You may choose any work from class or the reading, whether it was on the Midterm Exam Slides image board or not. Try to select slides that you have not yet discussed in the other questions.     Select TWO works of art or architecture that depict women, and use those examples to answer the following questions. What conventions did the artists use to depict the female body? How did they use the body to express a female ideal or to convey the roles of women in their society?  How do these works reflect social or religious practices?    How do rulers and/or societies use art and/or architecture for "political messaging"--to communicate their ideals, accomplishments, and place in the cosmic order? Select TWO examples to answer the question. You may discuss examples that relate to a single ruler or society (for example Augustus, Athens, Egypt) or examples that relate to two different rulers/societies. For example, you could discuss two aspects of the Parthenon or compare the Parthenon to something else.

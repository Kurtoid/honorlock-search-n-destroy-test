An octapeptide was completely hydrolyzed to yield the following set of eight amino acids (listed in alphabetical order; this is not the sequence): Asp, Asp, His, Lys, Met, Thr, Tyr, Tyr (DDHKMTYY). Unfortunately, your lab is poor and you cannot afford an amino acid sequencer. However, you are capable of doing "old-school" chemistry and you obtain the following information: 1) Treatment with cyanogen bromide yielded free Met and a heptapeptide.  2) Treatment with one of the carboxypeptidases yielded free Thr and a heptapeptide. 3) Treatment with trypsin yielded two tetrapeptides. 4) Treatment with chymotrypsin yielded two tripeptides and a dipeptide. Hydrolysis of the dipeptide established that its composition was Thr and His. What is the sequence of the original octapeptide?

You have been given a job to design an aerobic digestion system to treat waste activated sludge (WAS) produced by a local activated sludge process. Pertinent design data for the facility are as follows:  Mass flow rate of sludge (TSS or T): 4,000 lb/day Digester liquid temperature: 20 degC Influent BOD5 (Si): 3,000 mg/L Solid concentration in the feed sludge (Xi): 2.5 % (=25,000 mg/L) Specific gravity of the feed sludge (SG): 1.01 VSS/TSS (PV) = 0.8 VSS reduction goal through digestion: 40% Cell tissue oxygen requirement: 2.3 lb O2/lb VSS destroyed Fraction of influent BOD consisting of primary solids (Y) = 0.35 Sludge concentration is 70% of the incoming thickened sludge concentration; so the biomass concentration in the aerobic digester is 17,500 mg/L. Reaction rate constant (kd) = 0.10 day-1 Mixing and aeration system: diffuse air Diffuser efficiency (Oxygen transfer efficiency): 10% Specific weight of water (G) = 62.4 lb/ft3     (5 pts) If the volumetric flow rate of sludge (Qi) is 2,539 ft3/day and the design SRT is 40 days, determine the aerobic digester volume (ft3). (5 pts) Determine VSS destroyed by aerobic digestion (lb/day) (5 pts) Determine oxygen required for the aerobic digestion process (lb O2/day). (5 pts) If the airflow rate required for the aerobic digestion process (Ga) is 1,173 cfm, determine air requirements for oxygen and mixing (cfm/1,000 ft3) and answer if this adequate or not? Hint: the design rate is 20 - 40 cfm/1,000 ft3.

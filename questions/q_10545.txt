Mice are coprophagic, that is they consume feces -  YUK!, but it allows for interesting experiments.  Scientists carried out a cohousing experiment:    8-week-old, male, germ-free mice (GF) received culture collections (fecal transplants) from the lean (Ln) twin or the obese (Ob) co-twin in DZ twin pair.  Five days after colonization (5 dpc), mice were cohoused (ch) in one of three configurations:  Control groups consisted of dually housed Ob-Ob or Ln-Ln cage mates;   Experimental groups: A mouse with the lean co-twin's culture collection was cohoused with a mouse with the obese co-twin's culture collection (abbreviated Lnch and Obch, respectively).    The researchers went on to examine their data using PCA analyses (FIGURE ABOVE), this time as a time course.  Ln = lean twin, O = obese twin Obch = Obese twin cohoused with Ln Lnch = lean twin cohoused with Ob.    Main conclusion from panel B is: [ans1] Main conclusion from panel C is: [ans2] Contrast the results obtained in B to those in panel C: [ans3]

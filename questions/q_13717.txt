To get the perimeter of a rectangle, you compute 2 times the height plus 2 times the width. Create a function called "getRectanglePerimeter" which takes two parameters: height and width. The function returns 2 times the height plus 2 times the width. Be sure to test your code before submitting it. "But wait," you say. "I know of a different formula to compute the perimeter of a rectangle." Great. You are free to implement that. Please mentally test that your algorithm works with some rectangles in which you can easily determine their perimeter.Here's how to lose points on this question:- Not using a function.- Not using parameters.- Not returning a value at the end of your function.- Using prompt, alert, or any other input or output mechanism besides parameters and return values.

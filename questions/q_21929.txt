Problem 2 Counters count clock cycles ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner.  The tool bar has indent functions.  This is a generic counter design, of course there are other ways to make a counter (may require some modification for this problem). Make a counter module that counts from 0 up to MaxCnt and then goes back to 0 and continues to count. You will need clk, reset inputs, and outputs the current count, and carry which is True when count == MaxCnt. Use a parameter Size to set the size of array count and the output of the MUX. Use a default parameter Size of 5. For problems on this test use System Verilog, always_ff, and always_comb, and don't use reg datatype. (hint: see cheat sheet) A) First write a 2:1 multiplexer module (use parameter Size to set the width of inputs A, B, Sel, and output F. B) Write a D flipflop register (REG in the figure above) to hold the current count. Use parameter Size to set the width of D, and Q. Don't bother with output Q'. C) Write a module instantiating the multiplexer, and register with additional components/logic necessary to count 0-MaxCnt and then go back to 0 and continue counting back to MaxCnt ... and so on. Use parameter Size to set the width of Count, and MaxCnt. Don't forget the carry output, not shown in the figure. The carry should be 1 only when Count is reset to 0. Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables. Do not use compiler directives. ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate

Below are the results from Minitab when performing linear regression comparing the average summer temperature in the USA since 1769 to the date. The date is expressed as "days elapsed since June 1st, 1769". So for example, an x-value of 365 would mean "365 days after June 1st, 1769". Based on this output, answer the questions below.       a) Is this a situation where linear regression is appropriate to use? Address all four requirements. Type your answer below. Nothing is needed on your PDF. b) Based on the regression line, how much is the average summer temperature changing every 100 days? Explain how you got your answer. Type your answer below. Nothing is needed on your PDF. c) Explain in plain English what the R-sq value in the "Model summary" tell us. Your answer should make sense to my 90 year old grandmother. Type your answer below. Nothing is needed on your PDF.

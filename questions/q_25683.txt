Example: A company that produces motorcycles has a daily production cost of                     C(x)=2000-15x+0.05x2{"version":"1.1","math":"C(x)=2000-15x+0.05x2"} where C is the cost in dollars to manufacture a motorcycle and x is the number of motorcycles produced. How many motorcycles can be produced each day in order to minimize the cost of each motorcycle?Solution:The graph of the quadratic function is a parabola.Rewrite the quadratic function in standard form.                    C(x)=0.05x2-15x+2000{"version":"1.1","math":"C(x)=0.05x2-15x+2000"}The parabola opens up, because a{"version":"1.1","math":"a"} is positive:  a=0.05>0{"version":"1.1","math":"a=0.05>0"}Because the parabola opens up, the vertex of the parabola is a minimum.Find the x-coordinate of the vertex.                    x=-b2a=-(-15)2(0.05)=150{"version":"1.1","math":"x=-b2a=-(-15)2(0.05)=150"} Answer: The company keeps cost to a minimum when 150 motorcycles are produced each day. Exercise: The revenue associated with selling vitamins is                     R(x)=500x-0.001x2{"version":"1.1","math":"R(x)=500x-0.001x2"} where R is the revenue in dollars and x is the number of bottles of vitamins sold.Determine how many bottles of vitamins should be sold to maximize the revenue.

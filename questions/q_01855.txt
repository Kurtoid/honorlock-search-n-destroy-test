11) A solid sphere, a uniform disk, and a hollow hoop all having identical masses and radii are started from rest at the top of an inclined plane simultaneously. The sphere reaches the bottom first.  Using Newton's Laws and rotational dynamics show why this must be true.  (Hint:  Draw a FBD showing the forces present, and determine which are responsible for translation and which for rotation.  I for the hoop = MR2, I for the disk is 1/2MR2 and I for the solid sphere is 2/5MR2.  Base your answer on the acceleration of the center of masses of each object.)

In part 2 of this exam you will upload this picture as a PDF file. Question 7. (2 pts.)  Shown below the molecular structure of aspirin, you are not expected to know that yet. Given below the structure is a brief statement the hybridizations of the oxygen atoms in aspirin, you are also not expected to know this yet. Complete question 7 by re-writing the text about the oxygen atoms. The purpose of this is to make sure that your handwriting is legible enough to be graded on an actual exam.

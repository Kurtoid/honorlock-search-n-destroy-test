Exemplary Middle School   -  Read the following paragraphs describing a school for young adolescents. You will need to distinguish between those characteristics that are considered to meet the middle school philosophy and those that would characterize the school more as a junior high school.  Questions follow the reading. MSU Middle School serves young adolescents between 11 and 14 years of age.  The students are assigned to interdisciplinary teaching teams. Teachers are located near their content area peers. Students are assigned to a homeroom within that team where students read silently except when papers are passed out to students to be taken home to parents for review. The students progress through their day attending 4 classes in a block schedule that includes core academic subjects, as well as electives. The school also provides a wide array of lunch time and after school clubs.  The school leadership team, consisting of the principal, assistant principals and a variety of teacher leaders has recently implemented a transition program to ease the middle school students into the high school.

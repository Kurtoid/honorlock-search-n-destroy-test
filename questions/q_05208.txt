SCENARIO 6: DIGESTIVE PATIENT A patient, Mr. Daniels, arrives to the radiology department from the emergency room with severe diarrhea. Dr. Knowitall orders a Small Bowel Series. The on-call radiologist is on his way into the hospital; the radiologist has Dr. Knowitall work with you and has you begin the study. After giving the patient two cups of thin barium you begin taking overhead images. Mr. Daniels has a thinner than average, or hyposthenic, body habitus. You perform a patient interview and a review Mr. Daniel's medical notes from the ER to determine if he has been NPO a minimum of                hours before the small bowel series.

The progression of atherosclerosis and type II diabetes:The first step in the progression of atherosclerosis involves cells in vascular system called [13](13) cells, these cells are seen to be not working properly when they are not releasing enough[14](14). The decreased release of the chemical in #14 leads to an increase in[15](15: cell type) accumulation in the blood vessel wall. These cells that accumulate in the vessel wall engulf [16](16: K through P) which leads to immune system activation and inflammation. After the cells in #15 engulf too much of the chemical in #16 these cells die and lead to a large necrotic fatty plaque in the artery wall. Once the plaque grows it can become unstable and eventually rupture which leads to a [17](17) which can cut off blood flow in the brain leading to a/n[18](18) or get stuck in a coronary artery and lead to a/n[19](19). One link between type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease is the fact that the hormone (released by the pancreas) [20](20: put that hormone here) is supposed to lead to an increase in the production and release of the chemical [21](21: a strong vasodilator and promotor of vascular health) in blood vessels, but the resistance to this hormone seen in type II diabetes blocks this effect. In the progression of type II diabetes long before the disease is diagnosed (in a person with Pre-diabetes) the patient will need to release more[22](22: hormone) into the blood after a meal to get the same amount of glucose into cells than a person without pre-diabetes, this puts extra stress on the organ that releases that hormone[23](23: put that organ here). Since that organ is stressed to such a great extent with pre-diabetes then later with diabetes late stage Type 2 diabetes patients have to inject themselves with the hormone[24](24: hormone) just like Type 1 diabetes patients.

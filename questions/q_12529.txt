You have been called to a client's 2,000-head finisher site to determine the cause of acute deaths in several of his finisher pigs. On arrival at the farm, you note that the pigs are 4-5 months old, there have been 5 deaths since the farmer left the site yesterday afternoon and that there are about 15-20 pigs that are obviously ill just on cursory observation.

Alzheimer's Disease differ from Parkinson's in that in Alzheimer's, the cause may be related to which of the following?
1) Your research project involves a set of three Arabidopsis genes, which TAIR lists as of    'unknown function'. Two of these (ABC1 and ABC2) are 90% identical at the protein level, while the third (ABC3) is 40% identical to the other two at the DNA level and has 65% protein identity and 86% similarity. You obtain homozygous t-DNA knockout single mutants for abc1 and abc2, and they look the same as wild-type under all conditions that you grow the plants. Suggest a hypothesis for the lack of a mutant phenotype. (5 points) 2) Given the response to the last question, you decide to try other approaches to finding a whole plant phenotype associated with altered expression of each member of this gene family. What functional genomic approaches that do not involve t-DNA or transposon mutants would you choose? Indicate whether the approach allows you to distinguish a specific function for each gene (5 points) 3) Based on what can you hypothesize to which cell organelle ABC1, 2 and 3 proteins are targeted? Describe how you could test your hypothesis? Describe the anticipated results if your hypothesis is correct (5 points) 4) The centromere of eukaryotic chromosomes is essential for the faithful segregation and inheritance of genetic information. It contains highly repetitive DNA. They identified a repetitive sequence called pAL1 satellite repeat in Arabidopsis genome. Describe a cytological method to understand the distribution and copy number variation of the pAL1 satellite repeat in Arabidopsis centromeres (5 points)
Answer the following question based on the following scenarioYou are observing the kitchen as they prepare for lunch service. There are 2 employees preparing everything. Upon questioning, the cook tells you there are typically four staff in the kitchen. You observe the cook cutting raw meat on the counter top to put in the oven. As she is putting the prepared meat in the oven, the prep cook begins to cut up vegetables on the same counter top for the salad to be served in the dining room. The prep cook who is wearing gloves to cut up the vegetables then put the unusable portions of the vegetables in the garbage, knife in the sink, and then scoops the veggies for the salad into the serving bowl. The dining room is scheduled to start serving residents at 12:00. The cook puts food on the line at 11:00 and puts regular spoons in the pans for serving. As they begin the tray line you inquire about why the plate warmer is not turned on. The cook tells you it has been broke for a few weeks now. The menu for lunch service states "meatloaf, mashed potatoes/gravy, green beans, and cinnamon apples." On the plate you notice the green beans were left off. The staff states the patient does not like green beans. As you walk out into the dining room at 12:15, there is no staff in the dining room yet. As the trays come out at 12:30, nursing staff enters the dining room and starts serving the residents. Prior to serving the resident, a clothing protector is put on each resident to prevent spilling food on their clothes. As you walk around and talk to residents. They consistently tell the food tastes pretty good, but is not hot enough. After the trays are passed, cupcakes that a staff member prepared at home are given out to the residents for monthly birthdays'. 42. Which of the following tags would most likely be issued upon inspection? a. F812 - tray appearanceb. F808 - no beveragesc. F807 - patients report food not hot enoughd. F813 - cupcakes not from an approved source

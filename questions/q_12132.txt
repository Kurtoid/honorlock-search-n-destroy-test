DNA samples from four individuals were cleaved with the same restriction endonuclease. The DNA fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane, and hybridized with a DNA probe complementary to a region between sites C and D (see hybridization line below).The image of the western blot shows the labeled DNA bands and molecular weight (MW) markers. The lane labels I, II, III, and IV correspond to individuals I, II, III, and IV.Assume that fragments such as C-D and C-E are clearly resolved in this gel system. Fragment sizes are as given: A-B is 4 kb, B-C is 1 kb, C-D is 5 kb, and D-E is 650 bp.Individual I has five cleavage sites (A, B, C, D, and E) for the restriction endonuclease.   Which individual has at least one point mutation that eliminates restriction site E only?

Write a C function with signature bt* bstree (int* post, int size) that gets the pre-order and post-order traversals of a binary tree (NOT a binary search tree) in the form of two int arrays, reconstructs the tree and returns a pointer to the tree root as output (The third input parameter size specifies the number of elements in the tree). The assumption is that every node in the tree contains a distinct integer and has either two or no children.  Note: Pre-order traversal visits the parent before visiting its children, while post-order traversal visits the children before visiting their parent. Also, type bt is defined in the following way:       typedef struct btreenode{      struct btreenode *left;      int data;      struct btreenode *right; }bt;

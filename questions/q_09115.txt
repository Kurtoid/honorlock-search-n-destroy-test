Suppose a report from a survey states that 45% of Americans fear public speaking.  You believe that less than 45% of students at your school fear public speaking.   You randomly survey 250 schoolmates and find that 110 report they fear public speaking.  Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the percent at your school is less than 45%.   Use a significant level of 0.05.  That is, use a = 0.05. H0:   (select 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 from below)   [h0] HA:  (select 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 from below)   [ha]

The Asian longhorn beetle is an invasive species in New York City that has the potential to devastate urban trees if it grows unchecked in one of the city's parks.    If an exponentially-growing population has a birth rate of 6 beetles per year and a death rate of 0.5 per year, the intrinsic rate of increase (r) for the population is [ans4].   A population of 10,000,000 of these Asian longhorn beetles is estimated to be able to decimate Central Park.  If just 10 beetles were originally introduced to the park, with r from question above, in 2.5 years an exponentially-growing population of the beetles would increase to [ans1].  The beetle population was growing the slowest [ans2].  If dN/dt for the beetle population equaled zero, then [ans3].

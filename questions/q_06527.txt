Mycotoxins (Canvas Q17, Handwritten Pages Q17ab) Background: Fungi, neither animal nor plant, are abundant in our natural world: many living things we see in our everyday lives are classified as a fungus, ranging from the mushrooms we eat, to the mold found on rotting food, to the mildew commonly found in warm humid regions. Many types of fungi produce compounds known as mycotoxins as a defense mechanism. Some of these compounds are highly toxic to humans, causing severe harm or even death. Others target bacteria or viruses selectively and can be used medically as antibiotics or antivirals. Still others are promising as anti-cancer treatments, as they target rapidly-dividing cells. Mycotoxins are thus an active area of medical research in the hunt for new medications. Question: While studying a newly discovered fungus, a biochemist has managed to isolate a new mycotoxin that shows promise as an antiviral drug. To characterize this new mycotoxin, the biologist wants to determine the molecular formula of this substance. Elemental analysis indicates that this compound contains only carbon (55.0%), hydrogen (6.5%), and nitrogen (38.5%). An accurate molar mass could not be measured, but the compound is estimated to have a molar mass close to 320 g/mol. What is the empirical formula of this compound? [emp] What is the molecular formula of this compound? [molec] (Enter your formula with C and H first, followed by the other elements in alphabetical order. The blanks will not allow you to enter subscripts; type them in as normal numbers. For example, water would be entered as just "H2O". You should still be using proper subscripts on your work, though!) (Additional 10 points) On your Handwritten Pages, show all of your work for finding the empirical formula ( Q17a ) and the molecular formula ( Q17b ). Box your final answers.

Mutant mustangs   In horses, a single gene determines whether an individual can walk smoothly while carrying a heavy load. Horses with the wild type allele develop a spinal cord that prevents long strides, leading to a bumpy ride for the rider. Horses with a mutant allele develop a spinal cord that enables longer, smoother strides. By studying DNA in the bones of ancient horses, researchers traced the mutation back to a period around 1100 years ago, when Vikings invaded England. Researchers speculated that Vikings traded Scandinavian horses with the mutant allele to the English. These mutants were then bred with English horses to create a breed that one could ride comfortably.        Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 21-25.       21. The mutant allele first occurred in the population of Scandinavian horses by chance.

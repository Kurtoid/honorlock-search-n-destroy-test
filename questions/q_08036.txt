The picture below shows the maximum distance at which different chondrichthyan senses function. It demonstrates the "hierarchical nature" of the chondrichthyan senses.  Match the labels shown in the picture (Sense 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) with the appropriate form of sensory reception.
Probability Saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) are incredibly slow growing cacti that appear to benefit from the shelter of other desert plants, such as Mesquite (Prosopis) for their first several decades of growth. Researchers surveyed the cacti at Saguaro National Park near Tuscon, AZ to determine the probability of sprouting an arm (a sign the cactus has reached maturity) and location near a nursery plant. (These properties are independent but not mutually exclusive!) Use the addition rule of probabilities and the multiplication rule of probabilities to determine the following probabilities. Include your work in your R script for partial credit!      P|Arm| = 0.22                              P|Nursery| = 0.67 P|NoArm| = 0.78                         P|NoNursery| = 0.33   The probability of not sprouting an arm or no nursery plant: [p1] The probability of sprouting an arm or a location near a nursery plant: [p2]  The probability of not sprouting an arm and a location near a nursery plant: [p3] The probability of sprouting an arm and a location near a nursery plant: [p4] The probability of not sprouting an arm and no nursery plant: [p5]

A crucible is placed on a balance and is found to have a mass of 26.639 grams a sample of Na2SO4*xH2O is added to the crucible and the total mass is found to be 27.085 grams. The crucible is then placed on a ring stand and gently heated to remove to remove the bound water molecules. The final mass after heating was found to be 26.915 grams. What is the value for x in Na2SO4*xH2O?

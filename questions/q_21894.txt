The executive was so embarrassed that he called his outside corporate lawyer and asked him to represent his son.  The corporate lawyer explained that he did not know criminal law and that it would take him hundreds of hours to learn the law.  The executive stated that he did not care how much it cost, he wanted the corporate lawyer to take the case.  The corporate lawyer accepted the representation and ended up charging $25,000 for representing the minor.  The range of what other lawyers would charge in the community was $1000 to $10,000.  The lawyer billed the executive at his normal hourly rates and he did in fact spend hundreds of hours to complete the representation.

Use the traditional method or p-value method to test the given hypothesis. Assume that the population is normally distributed and that the sample has been randomly selected.With individual lines at the checkouts, a store manager finds that the standard deviation for the waiting times on Monday mornings is 3.7 minutes. After switching to a single waiting line, he finds that for a random sample of 29 customers, the waiting times have a standard deviation of 2.9 minutes. Use a 0.025 significance level to test the claim that with a single line, waiting times vary less than with individual lines.

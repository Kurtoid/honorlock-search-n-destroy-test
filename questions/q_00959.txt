Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr 2.60 liters of oxygen gas is produced at 0.25 atm of pressure. It is to be compressed and stored in a 200 mL cylinder.  If the temperature is constant, calculate the pressure, in mm Hg, of the oxygen in the cylinder.   To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem. Show your work (equation/and units) by using the equation editor () in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use    to insert ratios. Be sure to include proper units and the final answer! Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

(10 bonus points) Recall that the polar equation for a spiral is r = ath for some number a. Archimedes gave the following proposition in his treatise on spirals: The area bounded by the first turn of the spiral and the initial line is equal to one-third of the circle bounding the first turn of the spiral. (In other words:  see the picture below). Use a double integral to give a proof of Archimedes' proposition.

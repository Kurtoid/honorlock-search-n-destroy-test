A 6.00-kg ornament is held at rest by two light wires that form 30deg angles with the vertical, as shown in the figure. An external force of magnitude F acts vertically downward on the ornament. The tension exerted by each of the two wires is denoted by T. A free-body diagram, showing the four forces that act on the box, is shown in the figure. If the magnitude of force F is 410 N, what is the magnitude of the tension T? Assume that the positive y-axis points upward and the positive x-axis points to the right.

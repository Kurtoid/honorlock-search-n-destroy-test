Suppose that a farmer is growing wheat on 1 acre of land.  One year he plants a certain number of seeds and harvests a certain amount of wheat.  The following year, he decides to double the amount of seeds planted.  In return, he observes that his wheat harvest also doubled.  The farmer is amazed by the fact that he doubled the amount of seeds and it led to a doubling of the harvest!  He begins thinking to himself:  "It would be possible to feed the entire world population by simply growing more and more wheat on my land.  I could end world hunger as we know it!" Even if we assume an infinite supply of wheat seeds, why would this not be possible? Carefully construct an argument based on production economics in answering the question.  (Simply restating that it is not possible does not give credit).  Hint: seeds can be treated as a variable input; land can be treated as a fixed input.

Re: In a larger study on quality of assisted living care facilities, a new measurement scale (15 items) is developed to measure "Perceived Quality of Residential Care" (PQRC), to be used with residents in evaluating the extent to which they experience their housing as safe, supportive, strong on health care, and access to social opportunities. To validate the scale, residents from 3 Medicaid funded nursing homes (which have less resources) and an equal number of residents receiving privately funded nursing homes (which have more resources) were surveyed using this new measure. As anticipated, the evaluators found that the private nursing home residents scored significantly higher on most items of the measure.   ------------------------------------------------- In the study described above, the evaluators considered that there may be meaningful differences in the health status of residents in the nursing homes and in-home care client, and that these differences may impact the residents' experiences in their respective care.  Of the following, which is the BEST way to capture any differences in perceived quality of care of the entire sample while controlling for possible differences in health status?

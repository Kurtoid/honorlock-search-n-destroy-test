A block, m, with mass of 2 kg, is sitting against a spring that is compressed 0.300 m from its equilibrium length.  The spring has a spring constant of 1800 N/m.  When the block is released, it goes across the level, frictionless surface between A and B, up the frictionless ramp to point C, across the rough surface from C to D, and up the frictionless diagonal to point E.  It then follows the same path on the way down and returns to the spring, compressing it by 0.238 m before being pushed back to the right and sent up the ramp again.      a. How can you apply the conservation of mechanical energy equation once to determine the force of friction acting on the block between points C and D?  [Type your answer below.] b. Draw a sketch of this scenario, with the initial and final states you chose in part a labeled and a horizontal line drawn to represent your choice of the PEg=0 height. [you will scan and upload this diagram after the assessment] c. Draw the work diagrams for each non-conservative force that does work on the block. [you will scan and upload this/these diagram(s) after the assessment] d. Determine the force of friction acting on the block between points C and D.  [Type your answer below.] e. For the trip upward only, rank the total amount of mechanical energy of the block at points A, B, C, D, and E, from lowest to highest.  Clearly indicate ties, if any.  [Type your answer below, in the format H

Case Study #2--Brian Murphy Brian Murphy, is a 55 year old male, who retired early and has always enjoyed working on his farm. For years, he has performed all of the manual work and sees it as a fun hobby and a great way to stay in shape. Recently, Brian's mood has changed. He reports feeling sad, He cries often and is constantly fatigued.  He always feels tired, and has had difficulty with waking up around 2-3 am.  He reports feeling overwhelmed with life and dreads the prospect of "another damn day to get through." His appetite has decreased significantly and it's apparent to others that he's lost weight. He states he is not suicidal, but feels "useless".     His wife reports that he doesn't enjoy anything anymore.  He no longer works on the farm and often seems to be confused and forgetful.  She states that he is frequently agitated and restless. Brian is likely suffering from Major Depressive Disorder.  Which of the following symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder are present in this case?

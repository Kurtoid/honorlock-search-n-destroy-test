B. For nature then(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,And their glad animal movements all gone by)To me was all in all.--I cannot paintWhat then I was. The sounding cataractHaunted me like a passion: the tall rock,The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,Their colours and their forms, were then to meAn appetite; a feeling and a love,That had no need of a remoter charm,By thought supplied, nor any interestUnborrowed from the eye.--That time is past,And all its aching joys are now no more,And all its dizzy raptures. Not for thisFaint I, nor mourn nor murmur, other giftsHave followed; for such loss, I would believe,Abundant recompence. For I have learnedTo look on nature, not as in the hourOf thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimesThe still, sad music of humanity,Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample powerTo chasten and subdue.

You recently attended a meeting where an investigator from a famous cancer hospital compared their outcomes of patients with stage IV lung cancer treated in the 1990s with carboplatin and taxol to those treated between 2000-2010 with the same chemotherapy plus an EGFR inhibitor. This showed a remarkable improvement in median survival for the latter group from 8months to 14months. The probability that this was due to chance was less than .00001. The investigator now suggests that this should be the new standard against which all future treatments are compared. You are concerned about the possible confounding variable of differences in imaging modalities between the 2 cohorts ask what percent of patients in each group were staged by CT alone and by PET/CT. The speaker acknowledges that they did not begin using PET/CT for evaluating lung cancer patients until about 2001. You point out this could skew the results of his comparison in favor of the more recently treated patients and that the survival benefits observed may be entirely an artifact. The audience applauds and the speaker is noticeably annoyed. The bias you are concerned about is called?

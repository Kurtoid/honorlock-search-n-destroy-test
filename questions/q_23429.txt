In lecture, an example was shown and discussed that showed a greater percentage of cells with well-defined stress fibers on surfaces where peptides (of the same type) were conjugated to surfaces using star PEG (where more than one peptide was conjugated per PEG tether) rather than one-arm PEG (where only 1 peptide was conjugated per PEG tether), but the total peptide density was the same in both conditions.  What most likely contributed to the increase in well-formed stress fibers?

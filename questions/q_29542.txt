In a small mustard plant species, gene mapping crosses are performed between the gene controlling whether flower petals are produced and the gene controlling whether pollen is produced.  Making no petals is recessive, as is making no pollen.  For the cross the parent plants fertilized make no petals and no pollen, and the plants that are the source of pollen have been bred to be heterozygous for both genes (as is usual for such a mapping cross).  The offspring phenotypes were recorded as follows: 14 with petals but without pollen8 without petals but with pollen40 with petals and with pollen38 without petals and without pollen What is the map distance between the genes for these two traits?

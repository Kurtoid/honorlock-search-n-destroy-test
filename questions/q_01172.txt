Now consider a credit default swap (CDS) on this bond with semiannual payments to be paid in arrears. You estimate that the recovery rate is 32% and that the instantaneous hazard rate over the life of the bond is 5%. The risk-free zero-coupon yield curve is flat at 2% per annualized with continuous compounding. Use this information to calculate the fair annualized credit default swap spread for this bond. Do not use the approximation if you want credit.

Delbert, Evan, Ferdinand, and Gary are friends. One day, and on a dare, they all four decide to break into the local nuclear power plant at midnight. The plant only has a few workers at night, so the four friends know they can easily enter into the plant without being caught. All four pick the lock of the main door of the plant (it was a flimsy door). Delbert, Evan, Ferdinand, and Gary come across one door that states "DANGER" and "TOXIC SUBSTANCES LOCATED BEHIND THIS DOOR." All four friends disregard these messages and, instead, pick this particular door's lock too (all doors in this plant are flimsy).

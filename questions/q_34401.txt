**Note: even though the points for this question show up as '0' next to it, 5 bonus points will be added to your final score for a correct answer** Suppose that a new MIPS instruction, called bcp, was designed to copy a block of words from one address to another. Assume that this instruction requires that the starting address of the source block be in register $t1 and that the destination address be in $t2. The instruction also requires that the number of words to copy be in $t3 (which is > 0). Furthermore, assume that the values of these registers as well as register $t4 can be destroyed in executing this instruction (so that the registers can be used as temporaries to execute the instruction). Do the following: Write the MIPS assembly code to implement a block copy without this instruction. Then write the MIPS assembly code to implement a block copy with this instruction. Estimate the total cycles necessary for each realization to copy 100-words on the multicycle machine.

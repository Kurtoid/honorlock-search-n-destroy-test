In the summer of 1988, a forest fire destroyed over one-fourth of Yellowstone NationalPark. Park officials had let the fire burn for several weeks before they took measures toput it out.  The let-burn policy is based on the idea that naturally occurring forest firescontribute to the overall long-term stability of the forest environment. Small forestfires destroy fallen trees and leaves on the forest floor before large amounts of thisdebris can accumulate and cause larger and more destructive fires. The earlier practiceof suppressing all fires may have contributed to the intensity of the 1988 Yellowstonefires because large amounts of tinder had built up on the forest floor. Forest fires alsomaintain the diversity of plant and animal life. Small fires destroy some tall trees andthus allow for the growth of low bushes and grasses that attract small animal wildlife. However, many people criticized the let-burn policy after the Yellowstone fire.Local ranchers were concerned that elk and bison would be driven out of the park andcompete with cattle herds for food. Others questioned the safety of allowing a fireduring a drought. Many people were confused by a change in policy after a hundredyears of anti-fire publicity. Some ecologists pointed out the difficulty of determiningwhat is "natural" in a forest that has been sustained by human activity. In the meantime, Yellowstone officials have announced a return to the no-burnpolicy that existed before 1970, at least until experts agree that letting forest fires burnthemselves out is justified.

The organization of proteins like actin and myosin in a skeletal muscle fiber gives it the appearance of [striations].   At a neuromuscular junction, the [Mneuron]  releases a neurotransmitter, activating the skeletal muscle fiber.   Junctional folds are an important feature of the motor end plate, since they increase its surface area, making more room for [C] (pick a letter). A. Voltage-gated Na channels B. Voltage-gated Ca channels C. Acetylcholine (ACh) receptors D. Acetylcholine (ACh)

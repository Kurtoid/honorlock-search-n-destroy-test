To measure copper in samples of sediment from Lake Nakuru, a 2.0023 g sample of dried sediment was digested for 1 hour in high purity nitric acid. The digested samples were filtered through a membrane filter and the filtrate was diluted to a final volume of 50.00 mL in a volumetric flask with purified water. Aliquots of 10.00 mL of this extract were transfered to 100 mL volumetric flasks, to which were added varying concentrations of a lead standard solution and then diluted to the mark. The solutions were analyzed by ICP-OES and the resulting calibration curve is shown below.  a) Calculate the concentration of Cu in the sediment extract, in mg/L.b) Calculate the amount of copper in the original sediment sample in mg Cu/kg dried sediment..

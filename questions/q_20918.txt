Excel Task 2      (max 5 pts) Go to the "Customers" sheet of the exam file. Management wants to know approximately how many months elapsed between a customer's first visit and their last visit.  To make life easy, they tell you to assume that there are always 30 days in a month.  So, if there are 120 days between a customer's first visit and that same customer's last visit, just divide by 30 and call it 4.0 months.  Type the heading "Elapsed Months" into cell H1. Now, for each customer, create a formula that calculates how many "months" of 30 days there are between that customer's first visit and last visit.    NOTES:   Results should be positive numbers. Format results with 1 decimal place. Remember that every month is 30 days for this question. This task will be graded manually, based on our evaluation of your work in column I.

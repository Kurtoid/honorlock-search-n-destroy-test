ASSESSMENT - Child Language Disorders   Maria, a 10-year-old girl, is scheduled for a comprehensive language assessment.  Her father and mother both come to the assessment along with her 6- and 8-year-old brothers.  The family primarily speaks Spanish-influenced English together with significant code-switching between Dominican Spanish and English.  Maria and her two older brothers speak only Spanish-influenced English and African American English to each other.  When they are speaking just to each other, Maria's parents speak mostly Dominican Spanish, although they are fluent in Spanish-influenced English as well (Dominican Spanish and its Spanish-influenced English omit the plural -s and the third person singular -s morphemes).  Maria's English skills are high enough to place her in a monolingual classroom and this evaluation will be done by a monolingual SLP.  Maria hangs out with Dominican and African-American friends in her neighborhood in Bushwick, Brooklyn. The teacher reports that Maria has problems in reading comprehension.  She does not know if Maria needs speech/language therapy or simply needs filling of academic gaps. Discuss your approach to conducting this language assessment.  First, in one paragraph discuss the language features (not speech) that one would look for in a typically developing ten-year-old with the linguistics background and input that Maria has had.  Spend the rest of your response focused on the information that you would gather during the evaluation and why that information is important.  What information to you want to obtain from the parent?  From the teacher?  From your clinical interactions with Maria?  How will you use that information to make a differential diagnosis? (This is the child language assessment question.  Focus only on aspects of language.  Do not include oral peripheral exam or anything that does not look at language.  Maria had a recent full audiological evaluation that revealed normal hearing.  Maria does not have a history of conductive hearing loss.  Hearing is NOT an issue in this case).

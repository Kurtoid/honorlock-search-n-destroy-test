Written question 3: One of the largest off-shore windmills in production is Vesta's V164-9.5-MW. This unit has a nameplate capacity of 9.5 MW and is twice the height of the Wisconsin State Capital building!(a) The V164-9.5-MW is designed to produce maximum power when the wind speed is 12 m/s. At maximum power, its overall efficiency is e = 0.43 (including the Betz limit). How long are the windmill's blades? The density of air is r = 1.2 kg/m3. Show your work.(b) The yearly-average capacity factor for many off-shore windfarm locations can reach 42%. How much energy does one V164-9.5-MW windmill produce in one year at such a location?(c) An electric utility charges $0.14 per kWh. The utility invests $27M to install one V164-9.5- MW windmill.

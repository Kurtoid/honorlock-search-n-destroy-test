Hunting and Gathering The oldest and most basic way of living is hunting and gathering, the use ofsimple tools to hunt animals and gather vegetation for food.

Today, however, this technology supportsonly a few societies, including the Kaska Indians of northwestern Canada, thePygmies of Central Africa, the Bushmen of southwestern Africa, the Aborigines ofAustralia, and the Semai of Malaysia. Typically, hunters and gatherers spend mostof their time searching for game and edible plants. Their societies are small,generally with several dozen people living in a nomadic, family-like group,moving on as they use up an area's vegetation or follow migratory animals.(Macionis, John J.

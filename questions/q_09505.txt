Link to Example Link to Video Covering Example Suppose that you have nine cards.  Five are green and four are yellow.  The five green cards are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  The four yellow cards are numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4.  The cards are well shuffled.  You randomly draw one card. * G = card drawn is green* Y = card drawn is yellow* D = card drawn is odd-numbered sample space = {G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4}.  Find each of the following.  Round to 3 decimal places. a.  P(Y AND E) =  [c] b.  P(Y OR E) =  [d] c.  Are Y and  E mutually exclusive?  Hint:  Mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time.  That is, events Y and E are mutually exclusive if a randomly selected card cannot be both yellow and even-numbered.  [no] d.  Are G and Y mutually exclusive?    [yes]

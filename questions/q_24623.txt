Closely read  The Tell-Tale Heart.  Remember that this short story is a work of fiction, which means that it is a made-up story written by an author named Edgar Allan Poe primarily for entertainment but also possibly to impart a lesson or moral. Poe tells this story in first-person point of view in the guise of an unnamed narrator, who is the main character in the story. Poe and then unnamed narrator describing his murder of an elderly man are NOT one and the same person: Poe was a very real 19th century writer, and the unnamed narrator is a fictional character invented or made up by Poe. Poe writes the story from the point of view of the unnamed narrator, but Poe is like an actor pretending to be a character; he is not really this murderous character himself. So, please do NOT at any time during your essay refer to the narrator as Poe or confuse or conflate the narrator with Poe in any way. Poe is the author of the story, so you may refer to him as the writer or mention that Poe writes or tells us something that occurs in the story, but do not refer to him as performing any of the actions performed by the unnamed narrator. If you refer to the character in the story telling of his actions, then you may refer to him as the narrator or the madman or the killer, etc.  Try to identify as many of the literary elements listed in the Literary Analysis Handout as you can. Identify one or more themes that you think are expressed in the story. Come up with one main point you would like to make about the work in your essay. This is your thesis. Your thesis could be based on some observation of your own, or it may be based on one of the following Tell-Tale Heart Discussion Questions:    Is the narrator reliable (can we believe everything he is telling us is true in the context of this fictional story)?  By "true" I don't mean is this is true story. It is NOT a true story. It is a fictional (made up) story, but the author could intend for the reader to accept or believe (or doubt) what the narrator is telling us regarding his motives or thoughts or actions in the context of the events of the story. For instance, the narrator tells us that, despite killing the old man, he really loved him. Is he telling the "truth"?  Is the old man's eye really the reason that the narrator kills the old man? Why does the old man's eye bother the narrator so much? Does the narrator really love the old man? Can we believe that there was no ulterior motive for the murder? What is the narrator's mental state? Is he sane or insane? How do you know this? Provide examples. Is the sound really the heartbeat of the murdered old man? If not what is it? What does the story say to us about the nature of guilt? What does the story tell us about the nature of evil? Why does the narrator give himself away in the end? How is irony used in the work? What is the main theme of the work? What is Poe's purpose in writing this story? Is it simply intended to be a spooky story to tell perhaps on Halloween, or does he have a more serious purpose in mind? If your thesis is that the narrator is completely insane, the answer to the question of what the sound is would be one of the points providing evidence or proof of his insanity. There are many other examples of how the narrator is insane in the story to use as basis for this thesis. Again, feel free to focus on something else in the story as a thesis. This is just another suggestion. What symbolism is used in the story? What metaphors can you identify? What imagery can you identify? What is the theme of the story. If you think you can identify an overarching theme, you can make this the basis of your thesis.    Write a literary analysis essay on The Tell-Tale Heart  In doing so, touch on as many of the literary elements discussed in the Literary Analysis Handout as you can Specifically answer the following questions about "The Tell-Tale Heart" in your essay:  What is the story about (plot)? Again, you do not have to retell the entire story. Just briefly summarize in a nutshell what the story is, especially as it relates to your thesis. Assume your reader has read the work; only focus on the parts of the plot (the story that the work tells) that relate directly to your thesis (the main point) about the work. What is the point of View (First person; third person, etc.); Is the narrator reliable (can we believe everything he is telling us is true or real)?; What is the narrator's mental state? Is he sane or insane? How do you know this? Provide examples. Your answer to this question can form the basis of a thesis. Just be sure to provide some support in the form of details from the story to support your thesis. If you want to focus on another aspect of the story as your thesis, you are free to do so. Is the sound really the heartbeat of the murdered old man? If not what is it? What symbolism is used in the story? What metaphors can you identify? What imagery can you identify? What is the theme of the story. If you think you can identify an overarching theme, you can make this the basis of your thesis.  In any event, you should state a thesis in the first paragraph, and then provide some support for it in the form of examples, details, observations, short quotations, and so on from the story. In doing this touch on any literary elements you can identify. Some of these elements can be incorporated into the support for your thesis. For instance, the beating heart is imagery, but it also symbolizes the narrators guilt. Use PRESENT TENSE when discussing this work: "The narrator of The Tell-Tale Heart is, despite his protests to the contrary, completely insane." "The narrator tells us that he kills the old man because "one of his eyes resembled that of a vulture" (403). If you use a quotation, make it short, no more than three lines. Usually you would include the page number in the citation, but our copy of The Tell-Tale Heart is not paginated; so just include the author's last name in the citation like this (Poe). This essay should be around two pages in length (500-750 words).  Open a Word Document, format it in MLA style, and write your essay in the Word document.

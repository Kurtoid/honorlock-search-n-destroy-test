The nurse holds the patient's relaxed arm with elbow flexed at a 90-degree angle, places a thumb over the tendon in the antecubital fossa, and strikes the thumb with the pointed end of the reflex hammer. Which deep tendon reflex is the nurse assessing?
We are in a plane, but we are being pursued by some baddies in their own plane. We cannot outrun them, so we need to stop their plane somehow. Fortunately, there's this guy Bob with us that has really strong lungs, and Bob has a unique skill: he can exhale perfect sine waves of air. (Bob is a weird guy.) Bob is going to lean out the window and blow some air back at the other plane in hopes that it causes their plane to pitch up and down out of control. We spot a logo on the plane: Fake 1s Engineering, and as contorls engineers, we happen to know the differential equation for their planes:

Part II - Monopolistic Competition: Suppose 2 foreign car companies compete with each other in the U.S., Toyota and BMW. Suppose that U.S. consumers have a demand of Q = 60-P,  where Q equals the total quantity sold by both firms with Q = Q1 + Q2, and P denotes the price. Further, both companies face a marginal cost MC per unit as well as a fixed cost F. Toyota's profits are hence given by P * Q1 - MC * Q1 - F and BMW's profits equal P * Q2 - MC * Q2 - F.

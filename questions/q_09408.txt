After glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, but before the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation, the carbon skeleton of glucose has been broken down to CO2 with some net gain of ATP.  Most of the energy from the original glucose molecule at that point in the process, however, is stored in the form of which of the following molecules?

An OTA is performing PNF techniques to a patient's (L) UE.  The patient has an old fracture of the humerus (healed) and resultant weakness in the biceps and anterior deltoid.    The OTA is able to facilitate an improved response in the biceps and deltoid by providing max resistance to the stronger wrist and finger flexors.  This concept is referred to as:
CONSTRUCTABILITY
In the United States and Canada, bats use one of two strategies to survive winter. They either migrate south, or they hibernate. Recently, those that hibernate seem to have come under attack by a fungus, Geomyces destructans (Gd), an attack that is occurring from Missouri to New England, Canada, and even the state of Washington. Many infected bats have a delicate, white filamentous mat on their muzzles, which is referred to as white-nose syndrome (WNS). The fungus invades the bat tissues, causes discomfort, and awakens the bat from its hibernation. The bat fidgets and wastes calories, using up its stored fat. The bat then behaves abnormally, leaving its cave during daytime in winter to search for food. Their food, primarily insects, is scarce during the winter, and the bats ultimately starve to death. Since 2006, it is estimated that over six million bats have perished from WNS. The Gd mat on the fur of the bats should be expected to consist of ________.
In a one-sample t-test, what concept does the numerator of the t-ratio measure?
Dr. Cotta is interested in the causes of behavioral problems among children. To study this, she employs the "Behavioral Tendencies" scale, which uses parents' and teachers' ratings to score children on a scale of 1-70. (Higher scores indicate more behavioral problems.) The population mean on this scale is 29.87. Dr. Cotta suspects that one of the many causes of behavioral problems is a stressful home environment.             She gathers a random sample of 100 children who have been classified as living in a stressful home. For this sample the mean score on the Behavioral Tendencies scale is 36.95. She computes the following test statistic: t = 1.66. If Dr. Cotta conducted a one-tailed hypothesis test (a = .05), a) what decision should she make regarding the null hypothesis? b) Then in "plain English" what does this tell her about the effects of a stressful home environment on behavioral problems? Make sure you include the statistics in APA format.

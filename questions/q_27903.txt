Carefully read the following excerpt from "Professions for Women," a speech delivered by Virginia Woolf to a branch of the National Society for Women's Service on January 21, 1931, then respond to the question that follows.   "But to tell you my story--it is a simple one. You have only got to figure to yourselves a girl in a bedroom with a pen in her hand. She had only to move that pen from left to right--from ten o'clock to one. Then it occurred to her to do what is simple and cheap enough after all--to slip a few of those pages into an envelope, fix a penny stamp in the corner, and drop the envelope into the red box at the corner. It was thus that I became  a journalist; and  my effort was rewarded on the first day of the following month--a very glorious day it was for me--by a letter from an editor containing a cheque for one pound ten shillings and sixpence. But to show you how little I deserve to be called a professional woman, how little I know of the struggles and difficulties  of such lives, I have to admit that instead of spending that sum upon bread and butter, rent, shoes and stockings, or butcher's bills, I went out and bought a cat-- a beautiful cat, a Persian cat, which very soon involved me in bitter disputes with my neighbours. What could be easier than to write articles and to buy Persian cats with the profits? But wait a moment. Articles have to be about something. Mine, I seem to remember, was about a novel by a famous man. And while I was writing this review, I discovered that if I were going to review books I should need to do battle with a certain phantom. And the phantom was a woman, and when I came to know her better I called her after a heroine of a famous poem The Angel in the House. It was she who used to come between me and my paper when I was writing reviews. It was she who bothered me and wasted my time and so tormented me that at last I killed her. You who come of a younger and happier generation may not have heard of her--you may not know what I mean by the Angel in the House. I will describe her as shortly as I can. She was intensely sympathetic. She was immensely charming. She was utterly unselfish. She excelled in the difficult arts of family life. She sacrificed herself daily. It there was chicken, she took the leg; if there was a draught she sat in it--in short she was so constituted that she never had a mind or a wish of her own, but preferred to sympathize always with the minds and wishes of others. How does the author's talk about killing the Angel in the House relate to empowering herself?

9. In this problem you will design a series of MUX devices. a) Draw a functional block diagram for a 2-input MUX with active-low enable (labeled E). Use the following labels: select lines Sa, and inputs Xb (with the normally used subscripts), and output Y. All Sa, Xb, and Y are active-high. b) Design a circuit using only SSI gates to implement this MUX. c) Draw a functional block diagram for a 4-input MUX with active-low enable (labeled E). Use the following labels: select lines Sa, and inputs Xb (with the normally used subscripts), and output Y. All Sa, Xb, and Y are active-high. d) Design a the 4-input MUX from part c using a minimum number of 2-input MUX devices (as drawn in part a) and no other device. (If necessary, also use SSI gates for less credit.) e) Assume that you have 2-input MUX devices that have the same functional block diagram as the one in part a, but the enable is a tri-state enable. Design a 4-input MUX (with no enable) from a minimum number of these 2-input MUX devices and no other devices. (If necessary, also use SSI gates for less credit.)

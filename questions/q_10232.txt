(4 points) (Nothing needs to be typed into the box for this part)ii. How much energy, in kJ, is released in the cooling process? (6 points) Type your final answer into the box (or as far as you get) for credit and then upload your work after completing the exam.BP ethanol = 78.3degCMP ethanol = -114.1 degC[?]Hvap=38.56 kJ/mol[?]Hfus=4.93 kJ/molCm-liquid=112.3 J/(mol degC)Cm-gas= 65.6 J/(mol degC)  Free Response 3: For the reaction A + 2B  AB2, the following experimental rate data were obtained at 25degC. For all portions of this question, type your final answer into the essay box (or as far as you get). Then, upload your work after completing the exam. (5 points each; 15 points total)   Trial [A]0  [B]0  Rate (M/s)   1 0.330 0.235 0.185   2 0.330 0.470 0.740   3 0.110 0.235 0.0615    i. Determine the rate law for the reaction. ii. Determine the value of k with units for the reaction. If you cannot get a rate law for part i, make an assumption for the rate law and clearly write it. Use this to answer this question. iii. Determine the initial rate of the reaction when the initial concentrations of both A and B are 0.750 M. If you cannot get a rate law for part i and a value for k for part ii, make an assumption for the rate law and clearly write it. Use this to answer this question. Free Response 4: A reaction has the rate law, rate=k[A2]. Answer the following questions for this reaction. i. What would be the label of the y-axis for a plot that would produce the straight line shown in the plot above? (2 points) ii. If the initial concentration is 0.100 M, how much time, in minutes, is required to decrease the concentration of A2 to 0.0200 M? (5 points)

When solving a system of linear equations in three variables, you must start by selecting ONE variable to cancel from TWO pairs of equations (the same variable must be eliminated from two different pairs). For the system given below, explain CLEARLY which variable you would eliminate first, how you would eliminate that variable  and why that variable is the best choice. You must explain in detail why the variable you chose is a better choice than the other variables. In other words:(1) state WHICH variable you would eliminate first (x, y, or z)(2) explain HOW you would eliminate that variable from two different pairs of equations (so not just once, but twice) - don't do the math, just tell me(3) why is the variable you chose to eliminate the best choice (in other words, why are the other variables not as good of choices) Do NOT solve the system - simply provide answers to 1 to 3 above for the given system.   System:

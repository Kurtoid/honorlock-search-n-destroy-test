This is Question D. Please write your solution complete with your full name and Question D at the top. When you have submitted the auto-graded portion of the exam, upload your solution to the Question D assignment in the Exam 2 module within 15 minutes.  Consider the algorithm below, which computes the maximum element of an array A.  max(A,n), where n [?] N+ and A = [a0...an-1] is an integer array (1) i - 0 (2) m - a0 (3) while i < n-1 do (4)     if m < ai+1 then m - ai+1 (5)     i - i+1 (6) end (7) return m {output is the maximum value of the array A}  (a) (5 points.) Prove that m = max(a0...ai) is loop invariants. (b) (3 points.) Use the loop invariant m = max(a0...ai) (proven in part (a)) and the loop invariant i <= n-1 to show that max is partially correct. (Note that you do not need to prove that i <= n-1 is a loop invariant.) (c) (2 points.) Find the number of times the if condition in line (4) is tested for an array of length n.

A planet has a mass that is 5.50 times the mass of the Earth. It has a radius 2.25 times larger than Earth's radius. The planet's orbit is 16 times greater than the Earth's orbit. The time it takes the planet to orbit it's star is 36 of our years. (a) What is the mass of this planet's star compared to our star. Your answer should be a number multiplied by MS{"version":"1.1","math":"MS"} where MS{"version":"1.1","math":"MS"} is the mass of Earth's Sun, e.g.12.4MS{"version":"1.1","math":"12.4MS"} or0.124MS{"version":"1.1","math":"0.124MS"}. (11 points) (b) A person on the surface of Earth has a potential energy of 4.53x109{"version":"1.1","math":"4.53x109"} J or -4.53 GJ. What is the potential energy this person would have on the surface of this planet? You should not assume the near Earth approximation for potential energy is valid. (11 points)

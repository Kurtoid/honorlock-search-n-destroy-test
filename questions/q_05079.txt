Two firms compete in quantities, selling identical goods, facing the demand function:P = 150 - q1 - q2where P is price, and q1 and q2 are the output levels of firms 1 and 2, respectively. Assume that firm 1 is less efficient than firm 2, MC1 = 20 and MC2 = 10 (MC1 and MC2 are the marginal costs of firms 1 and 2, respectively). Find the Nash equilibrium quantities of this static game. What are firms' profits in equilibrium? Note: Here, to obtain full credit, I not only expect you to provide a numerical answer to the question, but also to describe the profit function that these two firms attempt to maximize and the first order condition of the firms' problem (i.e., derivative of profit function with respect to choice variable).

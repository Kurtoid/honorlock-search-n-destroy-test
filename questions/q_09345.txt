2 pages Lack of pointer alias knowledge at static (compile) time can cause heavy imprecision in dataflow analysis. So we would like to find out points-to-sets. Points-to(p) defines the set of variables pointer p may be pointing to at a given program point. Points-to sets are to be found at the entry and exit of each basic block. Aliases are language dependent based on permissible operations. In our language a pointer can only point to a variable, not to another pointer. Assume that the underlying language has the following constructs : p = &a (address of object a is assigned to pointer p, note that a is not a pointer), p = q (pointer copy), p = b[i] and ba[i] = p (a is an array of pointers, and p is set to a pointer contained at b[i] or vice-versa). Note that these are the only pointer operations supported in the language.     (I) Show through a small example using CFG how points-to() sets can be found for the underlying pointers at the basic block boundaries - just show the relevant pointer operations, data objects and nothing else.     (II) Formulate the problem as a data-flow problem and write the equations to solve the points-to() at the entry and exit of basic blocks.     (III) Write an algorithm based on (II) and show how it works on parts of the example in (I).

This rabbi/teacher (ca 3 B.C.E. - C.E. 29) from Nazareth in Galilee taught in the Orthodox Jewish tradition. His habit of instructing his followers to love, not hate or revolt against, their enemies (including Rome) and his claims to be the son of God with a new covenant for mankind angered both the militants and the Pharisees, who then mutually conspired against him:

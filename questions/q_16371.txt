Read the abstract provided below and determine the type of review:  Abstract Issue: The Affordable Care Act's (ACA's) health insurance marketplaces provide a critical source of coverage and financial assistance. States operating their own marketplaces cover a significant number of consumers without access to employment-based health insurance or public programs. Federal actions under the Trump administration have undermined the marketplaces, but the new administration has opportunities to implement and advocate for policies that strengthen state-based marketplaces (SBMs) to ensure they continue to serve as a coverage safety net. Goal: Identify federal policies to support SBMs and the consumers they serve. Methods: Structured interviews with directors and officials from 17 SBMs and analysis of recent federal policies impacting SBMs. Key Findings and Conclusions: The Trump administration has hindered SBMs by establishing onerous requirements and creating consumer confusion. Affordability remains a primary barrier to marketplace coverage, and federal initiatives could help reduce premiums and cost sharing. SBMs are an important resource for people who do not have access to affordable insurance through their jobs, but federal policy changes are needed to clear an easier pathway to coverage. In addition, the federal government should reinvest in advertising and outreach for the federally facilitated marketplace.

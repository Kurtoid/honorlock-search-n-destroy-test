Your 16-year-old baseball player was hit in the chest by a line drive and collapsed on the pitcher's mound. Bystanders report tonic-clonic seizure activity before he became completely unresponsive. They also report applying an AED and shocking the patient twice prior to your arrival. Currently, vital signs are BP 94/50, P 84, and R 12. You suspect

The client who is on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 6 LPM has a SPO2 of 89%. The nurse is instructed to place the client on a 100% non-rebreather mask. Which of the following must the nurse do to ensure that the client is getting the proper amount of oxygen?
The most abundant organic substance in cells:
Which of the following tissues is avascular?
Which of the following organs is least radiosensitive?
Three kinds of tickets are available for a concert: "up close", "in the middle", and "nosebleed". "Up close" tickets cost $25 more than "in the middle" tickets. "In the middle" tickets cost $35 more than "nosebleed" tickets. Twice the cost of an "up close ticket is $60 more than 6 times the cost of a "nosebleed" ticket. (a) Write a system of equations that models this application, where x is the price of "up close" tickets, y is the price of "in the middle" tickets, and z is the price of "nosebleed" tickets. (b) Find the price of each kind of ticket by solving the system of equations produced in step a. You will only receive credit if you use solving systems techniques on the equations set up in a, and show your work. NO CREDIT WILL BE PROVIDED FOR ANSWERS OBTAINED THROUGH OTHER MEANS (such as 'guessing' at the prices).
When two wind waves traveling through the ocean interact in such a way that the crest of one aligns with the trough of another, the result is (?).
The __________ is a horizontal grid from which musicians read the symbols of musical notation.
Take a binocular PD, then read the PD ruler at the center of the bridge for the monocular right eye measurement, then subtract from overall PD and that is the monocular measurement for the left eye.

Below is a PDF of your test. Work problems on your own paper, in order, clearly labeling each problems as you go. After you finish the PDF test, there are two multiple choice questions (below) that you must answer. Good luck!If you have any trouble during your exam, email  both Ms. C and Dr. Gee at monicac@stedwards.edu & carolg@stedwards.edu. 1324Exam2verE_s21.pdf
Consider two different implementations, M1 and M2, of the same instruction set. There are three classes of instructions (A, B, and C) in the instruction set. M1 has a clock rate of 80 MHz and M2 has a clock rate of 100 MHz. The average number of cycles for each instruction class and their frequencies (for a typical program) are as follows:    Instruction Class  Machine M1 - Cycles/Instruction Class   Machine M2 - Cycles/Instruction Class  Frequency   A 1 2 60%   B 2 3 30%   C 4 4 10%      (a) Calculate the average CPI for each machine, M1, and M2. (b) Calculate the average MIPS ratings for each machine, M1 and M2. (c) Which machine has a smaller MIPS rating ? Which individual instruction class CPI do you need to change, and by how much, to have this machine have the same or better performance as the machine with the higher MIPS rating (you can only change the CPI for one of the instruction classes on the slower machine)?
Over the course of millions of years various environments have changed. As grasslands slowly took the place of forests the inhabitants were forced to adapt or they went extinct. During this time period the horse gradually evolved from a small cat sized creature to the size of the modern horses we see today. This is an example of which type of natural selection?

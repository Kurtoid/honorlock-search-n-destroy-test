However, avian influenza is highly contagious and can quickly kill domesticated birds. Some human influenza viruses are similar to the avian influenza. People infected with avian influenza develop typical flu symptoms (fever, cough, muscle aches). However, symptoms may become more severe and life-threatening. If avian influenza evolves into a form that is easily transmissible from person to person, a global pandemic of widespread human death might occur.Which cells would be active during an immune response to a viral infection?

An experiment carried out to study the curing time (hrs) for an experimental adhesive yielded the following results 31.2    36.0    31.5    28.6    35.8    35.4    33.3    38.2 a. One of the key assumptions that must be met in order to use the confidence interval equations is that the sample data must come from a normally distributed variable. What type of plot should you make to determine if it is plausible that the sample data comes from a normally distributed variable? [normality] b. The appropriate plots show that the data is normally distributed and that there are no outliers. Calculate a 95% confidence upper bound for the true average curing time of this adhesive. [UB] c. Interpret the results. [interpretation]

Refer to the image below.  In the blank area below the image, type the following:   A: bone marking name B: bone marking name C: bone marking name D: bone marking name (opening) E. bone marking name (opening)     You MUST type "A, B, C... etc" before each individual answer to get full credit.  For bone marking names, you do NOT need to give the name of the bone that the marking is on; you only need to give the name of the bone marking itself.  You do need to give full names, however, to get full points.  For example, "olecranon" will only get you partial credit; "olecranon fossa" will get you full credit. Do your best with spelling.  Words spelled poorly will not receive full credit if instructor cannot identify the term based on how it is spelled.  Ignore the black lines that are not associated with a letter.  Each name is worth 1.5 points.

QUESTION 3: Probability     Answer all questions by showing clear mathematical method.      3.1   A fair ten-sided dice is rolled once.  Each face on the dice has a number from 1-10.  Give your answers to questions 3.1.1 - 3.1.4 as fractions.      3.1.1   What is the probability of the dice landing on an even number?   (1)     3.1.2   What is the probability of the dice landing on a number that is not a multiple of 4?   (1)     3.1.3   What is the probability of the dice landing on a square number?   (1)     3.1.4   What is the probability of the dice landing on 12?   (1)     3.1.5   Redraw the following number line and indicate ALL your answers from questions 3.1.1 - 3.1.4 on the number line.    (2)               3.2   The following two-way table shows different tigers in captivity in a particular country.      Bengal   Siberian   Sumatran   Total     Male   14   9   3   26     Female   17   4   13   34     Total   31   13   16   60      As part of a zoological study, the health of the tigers are being monitored.   *Hint for interpreting the table: The total column at the end shows the total for each row; the total row at the bottom shows the total for each column.  When chosen at random, work out the probability that:       3.2.1   a male tiger is chosen.   (1)     3.2.2   a Bengal tiger is chosen.   (1)     3.2.3   a female Sumatran tiger is chosen.   (1)     3.2.4   the chosen tiger is NOT Siberian.   (2)               3.3   There are ten coloured counters in a bag. The counters can be either blue, red, green or yellow.  When choosing at random the following probabilities arise: P(blue or red) = 0.7 P(not yellow) = 0.9 P(not blue) = 0.7  Determine the number of counters of each colour there are in the bag.

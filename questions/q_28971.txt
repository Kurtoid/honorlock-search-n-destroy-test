The following question came from the Mastering Biology homework. How might a change of one amino acid at a site, distant from the active site of an enzyme, alter the substrate specificity of an enzyme?(a) by changing the three-dimensional conformation of the enzyme(b) by changing the stability of the enzyme(c) by changing the optimum pH for the enzyme(d) by changing the binding site for a noncompetitive inhibitor Explain how changing one amino acid might change the three-dimensional structure of a protein.

When examining the competitive dynamics of an industry, it is important to analyze close competitors.  One way to determine who close competitors might be is to look for ________________, which is the extent to which competitors are vying for the same customers.
You are interested in the regulation of gene Q. Proteins G, H, and J are proteins that are important for regulating gene Q, and bind to its promoter region in a sequence-specific fashion. Proteins G and H both bind to site "A" but cannot bind to site "A" at the same time. Protein J binds to site "B" on the promoter. The promoter region is diagrammed in Figure 8-20. Figure 8-20 You develop a cell-free transcriptional system to study the effects of proteins G, H, and J on the transcription of gene Q. Using this system, you can examine the effects of adding these proteins to the transcriptional system in equal amounts and measuring how much gene Q is produced. When you add these proteins to the system, you get the results shown in Table 8-20. Table 8-20   Which proteins are likely to act as gene activators?

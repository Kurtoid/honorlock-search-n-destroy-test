If an event will always occur, the probability that it will occur is zero.
Use Figure 14.1 and the following description to answer the questions below.In a particular plant, leaf color is controlled by gene locus D. Plants with at least one allele D have dark green leaves, and plants with the homozygous recessive dd genotype have light green leaves. A true-breeding dark-leaved plant is crossed with a light-leaved one, and the F1 offspring is allowed to self-pollinate. The predicted outcome of the F2 is diagrammed in the Punnett square shown in Figure 14.1, where 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the genotypes corresponding to each box within the square. Figure 14.1 Which of the boxes correspond to plants with a heterozygous genotype?

You are conducting an experiment in which you add a newly developed fertilizer to plants. You construct a line graph for each test group to compare them. On the graph you put fertilizer added in mg on the x-axis and plant growth in cm on the y-axis. You want to calculate the rate of plant growth for each fertilizer concentration. The units of growth rate will be:

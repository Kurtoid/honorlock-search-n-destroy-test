An experiment investigated whether cell phone use increases drivers' reaction times.  College students were randomly allocated to a cell phone group or a control group.  The experiment measures subjects' response times (in milliseconds) in a driving simulation.  For the cell phone group, the sample mean time was 585.2, the sample standard deviation was 89.6, and the sample size was 32.  For the control group, the sample mean time was 533.7, the sample standard deviation was 65.3, and the sample size was 32. The null hypothesis is that the mean reaction times are equal. Which is the appropriate alternative hypothesis for this investigation?

Identify the part of the atom that most determines the chemical reactivity of the atom.
Consider the reaction shown:   2 A (aq) +  B (aq)  -->  C (aq) +  D(aq) The following data were obtained at a particular temperature.    Trial [ A ], M [ B ], M Initial rate, M/min   1 0.00400 0.600 4.91   2 0.0100 0.300 1.53   3 0.0100 0.600 12.3   4 see the next line ?    In Trial 4, 20.0 mL of a 0.340 M solution of A are mixed with 50.0 mL of a 0.600 M solution of B.  Use unrounded answers in the calculation steps.  Report your answer for k using correct sig figs.  You can use decimal format or E format. In decimal form for numbers less than 1, always enter the 0 before the decimal point. You should use E format when the power of ten is +/-4 or larger or to properly show sig figs. To enter scientific notation, use E format with no spaces, i.e. for 1.23x10-4 type 1.23E-4.  You must show your work in the file you upload to receive full credit. You'll be asked to type in your rate law in the next question. Fill in the following blanks with the appropriate answer. The order with respect to A is [A] The order with respect to B is [B] The value of the rate constant using trial 1 is [k] The units for the rate constant k are M[unit1] min[unit2] The rate for Trial 4 should be [rate] M/min

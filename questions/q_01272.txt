Which process is described below?  Rho binds to mRNA at a site called rut (rho-utilization-site) and moves along mRNA as it follows RNA polymerase Rho moves more slowly than RNA pol, so the only way it will catch up to RNA pol is if the pol pauses at a rho-dependent pause site When this occurs, rho causes RNA polymerase to dissociate from DNA using its hybrid RNA:DNA helicase activity

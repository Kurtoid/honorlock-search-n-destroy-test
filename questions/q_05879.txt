Convert the following while-loop into an equivalent for-loop as closely as possible using the code snippet bank and template below. It is not enough for the loop to be functionally identical; it needs to follow any patterns mentioned in lecture. int i = 10; while ( i >= 0 ) {     i--;     System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);     i -= 2; }  for (1. _____________; 2._____________; 3._____________)  { 4. _____________;    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);}
Question 10 is based on the following information:  Audit manager Merwin Magician performed a test of controls. The information below presents four possible outcomes (I. through IV.) that could occur when Merwin evaluates his test results.     I.  The achieved upper limit is less than tolerable deviation rate while the population deviation rate exceeds tolerable deviation rate.     II.  The achieved upper limit is less than tolerable deviation rate while the population deviation rate is less than tolerable deviation rate.     III. The achieved upper limit exceeds the tolerable deviation rate while the population deviation rate exceeds tolerable deviation rate.     IV. The achieved upper limit exceeds the tolerable deviation rate while the population deviation rate is less than tolerable deviation rate. 10.  As a result of tests of controls, Merwin assesses control risk too high and responds by increasing the extent of substantive tests.  This is illustrated by situation

A round robin scheduler with timeslice value of 2ms schedules an I/O bound task and two CPU bound tasks. The I/O bound task repeats 3 times a loop where it computes for 1ms and then issues an I/O request, where each I/O operation takes 1ms to complete. Each of the CPU bound tasks take 6ms. The context switching overhead is 0.1ms. Assume that the initial order in which these tasks are scheduled starts with the I/O bound task, followed by the CPU bound tasks.  For this system, compute the following four metrics: - total execution time in ms: [A] ms - average throughput in tasks/ms: [B] tasks / ms - average wait time in ms: [C] ms - average CPU utilization, rounded up to the nearest %: [D] %

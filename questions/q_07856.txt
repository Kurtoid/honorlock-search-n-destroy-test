The research and development department of a well-known household products company is producing a new liquid soap that will clean an entire home with only one drop. They have discovered that the production of the soap has created a byproduct, Fluoro-X. The environmental and health effects of Fluoro-X are unknown, but the company decides to pre-treat the waste stream from the lab before pumping it to the treatment plant. Their laboratory studies reveal that Fluoro-X reacts with chlorine gas, Cl2: Fluoro-X + Cl2 --> products The rate law for this reaction is d[Fluoro-X]/dt = -0.85/s*[Fluoro-X] To treat the waste stream containing Fluoro-X, a 50-L CSTR is designed that will supply Cl2 into the reactor. The Cl2 is pumped into the reactor at a rate of 2 L/s and is free of Fluoro-X. The flow rate of the Fluoro-X stream is 7.5 L/s and the concentration is 3.5 mg/L. The outlet from the CSTR is then sent to the sewage pipes. Draw the control volume. At steady-state, what removal percentage is achieved in this process? Report your answer with 3 significant digits. Type the numerical answer in the field below. It must match what is on your paper.

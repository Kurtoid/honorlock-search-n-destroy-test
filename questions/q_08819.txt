Use this copy of the HONORLOCK ROOM SCAN INSTRUCTIONS to answer the below questions Room Scan Instructions for Honorlock Proctoring The purpose of the room scan is to insure that the same testing environment requirements for an on-campus Test or Exam are being met at the student testing location.   The room must be well lit, the speed of the camera movement must be slow enough, and the video quality must be high enough so that the instructor can clearly identify what is in the room and what is on or under the desk or table at which the test will be taken on The scan must show the entire room as well as the entire desk or table at which the test or exam will be taken  Students are advised to view the How to Conduct a Proper Room Scan video from Honorlock for a visual explanation of a proper room scan. Students will have an opportunity to practice this and receive instructor feedback during the Orientation and Honorlock Quiz (O&HL Quiz). When the instructor reviews a student's room scan for a proctoring session they must be able to confirm that:  No other persons are in the room No notes or other course related materials are on the walls or within reaching distance of the desk or table at which the test or exam will be taken The desk or table on which the Test or Exam will be taken is free of prohibited items specified in the Honorlock Standard Testing Guidelines. These would include, but are not limited to, books, paper, cellphones or telephones, other computers including iPads and similar devices, extra monitors (on or off), televisions, cameras other than the room scan camera, headphones, printers, boxes  If the instructor cannot confirm that these requirements have been met then the Test or Exam score will be invalidated (grade of zero points).

All of the following groups were found in the West during the late nineteenth century EXCEPT:
Madison Construction produces two products, steel beams and wood beams.  Management desires that its product mix of beams maximize weekly total contribution margin.  Direct labor is limited to 2,500 hours per week and machine hours are limited to 1,000 hours per week.  The maximum demand for steel beams is 95 beams per week; while the maximum demand for wood beams is 100 beams per week.  Other data for the beams appear below.   Additionally, total weekly beam production cannot exceed 175 beams due to storage constraints.     Steel Beams Wood Beams   Contribution margin per beam $220 $150   Direct labor hours per  beam 130 170   Machine hours per beam 80 120    Below is a partially completed linear program model that seeks to optimize (i.e., maximizes weekly total contribution margin) the product mix of steel and wood beams.  Fill in the blanks in the partially completed model using variables S, W and TCM which are defined as follows as well as the data provided above.  Please note: you are not being asked to solve the model, only to fill in the blanks to properly state the model.  S = number/quantity of steel beams and  W = number/quantity of wood beams and TCM = total contribution margin  The objective function is TCM = $[variable1]S + $[variable2]W  The constraints are:  Direct labor constraint is: [variable3]S + [variable4]W

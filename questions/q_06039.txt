As part of a comprehensive initiative to reduce drug use among teenagers, a state passed a law forbidding the sale of aerosol paint to any person under 18 years of age. The law was drafted to impose strict criminal liability. A 16-year-old teenager, who was purchasing aerosol paint to use on his car, approached the clerk at a local paint store. After the clerk asked for identification, the teenager replied that he was 16 but promised he would not tell anyone that he purchased the paint from the clerk. The clerk agreed to sell him the paint but asked the teenager to return later that evening after the owner of the store had left for the day. Unbeknownst to the clerk, the owner overheard the conversation and notified police of the plan. When the teenager returned later to purchase the paint, police arrested the clerk and teenager just as the clerk was reaching out to take the teenager's money.

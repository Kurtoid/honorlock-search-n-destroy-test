Again, select any correct answers (multiple answers). "The presence of females in military occupations has steadily increased since 1979 (15). The need to increase physiological research regarding female service members has increased because of their participation in combat positions (16).  Military reports on heat illness demonstrate a similar incidence between men and women, however the incidence for exertional heat stroke (EHS) is lower in women (2, 6). Widespread use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the military has increased since 2006 with Ibuprofen (IBU) as the most prescribed NSAID at 49.2% of all prescriptions filled in 2014 (12). NSAIDs carry a risk of increased heart failure, prothrombotic events and gastrointestinal injury(7, 10). Out of all prescriptions, 21-22% were prescribed to females while the percentage of females in active duty equals 14% of total personnel(12)."

One enantiomer of psicose, namely D-psicose, is shown below. D-psicose can exist in an open chain form (D-psicose) or it can cyclize to form a six-membered ring (a-D-psicopyranose).

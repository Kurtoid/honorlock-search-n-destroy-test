The tires on cars lose rubber as they are used.  Consumer Reports randomly selected 32 tires and tested them over a certain period of time.   The tests resulted in a sample mean of 0.37 mm of tread lost with a standard deviation of 0.015 mm.   Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean amount of tread lost on all tires.
Based on the pKR values given in the table below, what is the net charge (+3, +2, +1, 0, -1, -2, or -3) for the most abundant form (>50%) of Arg and Asp at the given pH values? Assume that the pKa of the a-COOH for both amino acids is 2.0, and that the pKa of the a-NH2 group for both amino acids is 10.0. For each amino acid, list the charges in order from pH 3 (left) to pH 13 (right), separated by commas. Use blank #1 for Arg, blank #2 for Asp. Blank #1: Arg charges at each pH value listed in the table below Blank #2: Asp charges at each pH value listed in the table below  Blank #3: What is the isoelectric point (pI) for Arg? Blank #4: What is the isoelectric point (pI) for Asp?
The blood transports gases between the lungs and cells throughout our body.  The vast majority (98%) of oxygen (O2) is carried by hemoglobin in the red blood cells.  Carbon dioxide (CO2) is transported in the blood through three (3) different means.  List the three methods used to transport CO2 and describe the most important (prominent by percentage) method in detail.  Why do we use the third method the most?  Be sure to discuss oxygen and carbon dioxide loading / unloading at the tissues / lungs.  (30 points)       in your answer:     points     mention the 3 ways to transport CO2     3       fully explain the most prominent way of transporting CO2 and why we use this method the most.  Must discuss gas loading / unloading at both tissue and lungs - step by step.  O2 and CO2 do not have brains.  How do they go in opposite directions?   27     total   30

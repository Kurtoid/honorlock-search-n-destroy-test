In this excerpt from one of his most famous speeches, Civil Rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. reflects on a stay in the hospital several years before, when he was being treated for a condition that threatened his life. I've Been to the Mountaintop 1.   If I had merely sneezed, I would have died.  Well, about four days later, they              allowed me to move around in the wheelchair in the hospital.       They allowed me to read some of the mail that came in, and from all over the       states and the world, kind letters came in. 5    I read a few, but one of them I will never forget. It said simply,       "Dear Dr. King,       I am a ninth-grade student at the White Plains High School.       While it should not matter, I would like to mention that I'm a white girl. I read       in the paper of your misfortune, and of your suffering. 10 And I read that if you had sneezed, you would have died.      And I'm simply writing you to say that I'm so happy that you didn't sneeze."      And I want to say tonight that I too am happy that I didn't sneeze.      Because if I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been around here in 1960, when      students all over the South started sitting-in at lunch counters, 15 standing up for the best in the American dream.      If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been around here in 1961,      when we decided to take a ride for freedom and ended      segregation in interstate travel.      If I had sneezed, 20 I wouldn't have been around here in 1962,      when Negroes in Albany, Georgia, decided to straighten their backs      up. And whenever men and women straighten their backs up,      they are going somewhere, because a man can't ride your back unless      it is bent. If I had sneezed-- 25 If I had sneezed I wouldn't have been here in 1963,      when the black people of Birmingham, Alabama, aroused the conscience      of this nation, and brought into being the Civil Rights Bill.      If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have had a chance later that year,      in August, to try to 30 tell America about a dream that I had had.      I'm so happy that I didn't sneeze.

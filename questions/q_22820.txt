The price of a hot dog is $1.50 more than the price of a bag of potato chips. The cost of a soft drink is $3 less than the price of two hot dogs. (a) Write a system of equations that models this application, where x is the price of a hot dog, y is the price of a bag of potato chips, and z is the price of a soft drink. (b) Find the price of each item by solving the system of equations produced in step a. You will only receive credit if you use solving systems techniques on the equations set up in a, and show your work (on your paper - no need to enter it here). NO CREDIT WILL BE PROVIDED FOR ANSWERS OBTAINED THROUGH OTHER MEANS (such as 'guessing' at the prices).

Many of the protists from these chapters occur in anaerobic environments. They often transfer hydrogens and electrons onto 2 or 3 carbon fragments of pyruvate to make products such as lactate or ethanol. The purpose of these reactions is to oxidize molecules of ___. Glycolysis can continue making ATP, as long as this molecule is present.

Researchers studying pleasant touch sensations measured the firing frequency (impulses per second) of nerves that were stimulated by a light brushing stroke on the forearm and also recorded the subject's numerical rating of how pleasant the sensation was.  The data from the study is below.    Firing Frequency Pleasantness Rating   23 .2   24 1.0   22 1.2   25 1.2   27 1.0   28 2.0   34 2.3   33 2.2   36 2.4   34 2.8    Carry out a hypothesis test to decide if there is convincing evidence of a useful linear relationship between firing frequency and pleasantness rating.  Use .05 as the level of significance.   Be sure to state the hypotheses, name the test you are using, give the test statistic and p-value, and to make your conclusion.

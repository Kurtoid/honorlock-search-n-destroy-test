A 1.0 L flask is filled with NO and O2 initially, and after the reaction establishes equilibrium, the flask is found to contain 0.0018 mol NO, 0.0012 mol O2 and 0.78 mol NO2. What is the value of the equilibrium constant, Kc, at this temperature? 2NO(g) + O2(g) = 2NO2(g)
Consider the diagram below to answer the following question: If you interrupt the citric acid cycle after the reaction that forms succinate, how many ATP molecules would be generated per glucose molecule in a cell capable of aerobic respiration, where no other pathway has been affected. Assume 3 ATP molecules will be produced from every NADH, and 2 ATP from every FADH2 used in oxidative phosphorylation.

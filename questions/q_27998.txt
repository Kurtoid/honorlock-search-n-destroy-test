Section 9: Bid-Rent Curve Figure 1: The bid-rent curves in the City of Madison.            All questions in this section refer to Figure 1. Figure shows the distance to the downtown in kilometers (1 km = 0.62 miles) on the x-axis and rent per square foot on the y-axis, and plots the bid-rent curves for the government, retail, education, housing, offices for medical software companies and storage uses.     Circle one option to indicate the best answer. Include your choices in the text box below. For example, you can write "1 A, 2 B, 3 C, 4 D, 5 E". You can use any other format of the answer as long as your choices for each subquestion 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are clear.   1. [2 points] What is the land, located between six and sixteen kilometers away from the downtown, used for?      Government. Government and retail. Retail. Retail and education. Education. Education and housing. Housing. Housing and offices for medical software companies. Offices for medical software companies.        2. [2 points] What is the lowest rent per square foot paid for the land that is occupied by education?     $1 per sq ft. $6 per sq ft. $7 per sq ft. Strictly between $7 and $9 per sq ft. $9 per sq ft. $11 per sq ft.       3. [2 points] What use does take up the most land in Figure 1? (the question refers specifically to this 20 km depicted in Figure 1)     Government. Retail. Education. Housing. Offices for medical software companies. Storage units.    4. [2 points] What can be a reason for the bid rent curves for residential uses to peak at 10 kilometers away from the downtown?        Noises produced by traffics at 10 kilometers away from the downtown. Great school district located 10 kilometers away from the downtown. High crime rates at 10 kilometers away from the downtown. Pollution produced by the factory located 10 kilometers away from the downtown. Low infrastructure in the area located 10 kilometers away from the downtown.       5. [2 points] Consider the effect of a decrease in university enrollment during the pandemic. This requires less classroom space, and also means lower sales in nearby fast-food restaurants, bookstores, and other retail locations.    Assume the effect of the lower enrollment has not affected any other uses except the classroom space and retail space for shops and restaurants, i.e. bid rent curves for government, housing, storage units and office space for medical software companies have not been affected. How does this change affect the land use pattern within a city?           The bid-rent curve of educational uses shifts up. The bid-rent curve of retail uses shifts down. The land used for offices of medical software companies shrinks. The land used for single-family housing shrinks. The minimal residential rent increases. The boundary between the university and housing shifts away from to the downtown.

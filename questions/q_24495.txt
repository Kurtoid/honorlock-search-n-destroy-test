Question 4(50 pts) A circuit is shown below.  vin is an AC source that has zero output resistance. kn'= 200 mA/V2, W/L = 10, threshold voltage Vth=1V. Neglect channel length modulation (l=0).  Find the DC biasing voltage at the gate, drain and source, and the DC drain-source current of the MOSFET. Draw the small signal model of the complete circuit. Calculate the overall voltage gain  . Find the input resistance Rin and output resistance Rout.

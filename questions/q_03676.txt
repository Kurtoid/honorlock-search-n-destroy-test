A horizontal massless rod with a length of 4.0m is attached to a pivot on the left end.  A point mass, m1 = 5.0 kg, is attached at the center of the rod, and another point mass, m2 = 5.0 kg is attached at the right end of the rod.  In addition, an upward (toward the sky) force F = 200 N is applied at the right end of the rod.  Find the angular acceleration of the rod about the axis due to the weights of the two masses and the upward force.  (Hint: you'll need to compute the moment of inertia of the system first.)

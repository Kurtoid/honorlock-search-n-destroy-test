In an experiment, bacteria were grown in a medium containing heavy nitrogen (15N) for several generations.  (Therefore, you may assume heavy nitrogen has replaced all normal nitrogen in the DNA.)  They were then transferred to a medium containing normal nitrogen (14N) and allowed to grow.  The DNA was extracted and studied. Given the semi-conservative mechanism for DNA replication, which of the following results would be expected after at least four DNA replications in media with normal nitrogen? (A "strand" is 1/2 of the DNA double helix.)

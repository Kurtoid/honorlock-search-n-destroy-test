When patients come to the emergency room with chest pain, the diagnosis might be heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI).   Other possibilities include non-cardiac chest pain (control), stable angina pectoris (SAP), and unstable angina pectoris (USAP). Samples of patients with each of these diagnoses were obtained and the mean platelet volume (MPV) was measured, to see if the means levels of MPV are the same, or not, for the four patient populations.  The appropriate hypothesis test was performed on the data and resulted in a p-value of 0.00085.  Using the 0.05 level of significance, select the correct conclusion.

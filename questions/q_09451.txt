On your work paper you should number each problem.  Multiple choice that need calculations require basic work. Theoretical problems do not need work. If basic work (for calculations)  is not given, points will be taken away based no justification for the answer. If you are unsure of an answer put "guess" by that problem number. If the guess is correct, the points will not be taken away.

20.  In an insightful experiment performed in the 1960s, chloroplasts were first soaked in an acidic solution at pH 4, so that the stroma and thylakoid space became acidified.  They were then transferred to a basic solution (pH 8).  This quickly increased the pH of the stroma to 8, while the thylakoid space temporarily remained at pH 4.  A burst of ATP synthesis was observed, and the pH difference between the thylakoid and the stroma then disappeared.  Explain your answers. (a) Explain why these conditions lead to ATP synthesis. (5 points) (b) Is light needed for the experiment to work? (5 points) (c) Would ATP be synthesized if the solutions were switched so that the first incubation is in the pH 8 solution and the second one in the pH 4 solution? (5 points)

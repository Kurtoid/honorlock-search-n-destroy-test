DIRECTIONS: Choose the correct answer for each question. Shark Attack [A] The morning had started out well for 41-year-old surfer Sam Edwardes. Sam was with his housemate Dane near Belongil Beach in the Australian state of New South Wales. The waves looked good and Sam was sitting on his surfboard, waiting for the right time to begin his first attempt.[B] Suddenly, horror struck. A great white shark rose from beneath the surface and pushed him off his board with great force. Edwardes felt a sharp pain in his leg and began to scream. As quickly as he possibly could, he got back on his board and began paddling toward the beach. As he paddled toward the shore, he shouted for help and warned other surfers about the shark.[C] When he arrived on the beach, his housemate and others on the sand realized how bad the damage was. The scene was extremely frightening. The shark had bitten a large piece out of his leg and blood was spilling out quickly. The shark had also taken a large chunk out of his surfboard.[D] Fortunately, Edwardes and those around him remained remarkably calm. His housemate and others on the beach called for an ambulance and helped stop the blood flow with a number of surfing ropes. Although Edwardes was confused about what was happening to him, he stayed calm enough to thank those around him for helping him. He was soon airlifted1 to a nearby hospital.[E] After surgery lasting four and a half hours, it became clear that Edwardes had been extremely lucky. The shark had missed some of the most important arteries2 and nerves.3 Because of this, not only was he able to survive, but there is a good chance that he will be able to surf again in the future. 1 To be airlifted is to be transported by airplane or helicopter. 2 An artery is a tube in the body that carries blood from the heart to other parts of the body.3 A nerve is a part of the body that sends messages between the brain and other parts of the body, allowing for movement and feeling.In the first sentence of paragraph E, what does the word it refer to?

And into my garden stole,     When the night had vield the pole;      In the morning glad I see      My foe outstretched beneath the tree."   ."

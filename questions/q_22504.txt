Hot-dog vendors on the beach fail to cooperate with one another on the quantity of hot-dogs they should sell to earn monopoly profits. A consequence of their failure is that, relative to the outcome the vendors would like,     (i)  the quantity of hot dogs supplied is closer to the socially optimal level.    (ii)  the price of hot dogs is closer to marginal cost.    (iii)  the hot-dog market at the beach is less competitive.
A light triangular plate OAB is in a horizontal plane. Three forces with magnitudes, F1 = 5.0N, F2 = 8.0N  and  F3 = 10.0 N act on the plate, which is pivoted about a vertical axes through point O. In the figure, F2 is perpendicular to OB. Consider the counterclockwise sense as positive.  a) What is the sum of the torques about the vertical axis through point O, acting on the plate due to forces F1, F2, and F3 ? b) If the moment of inertia of the triangular plate is 0.655 kg.m2, what is the magnitude of the tangential acceleration of the plate at point B.

The patient is to be treated to a depth of 11.25cm from the anterior and has a lateral separation of 35.6cm and an AP separation of 21.3cm. The AP field size is 13.5cm x 16.5cm and the lateral field sizes are 8.5cm x 16.5cm. What is the AP SSD?

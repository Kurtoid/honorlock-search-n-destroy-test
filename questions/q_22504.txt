Is there a correlation between participant's score on self-esteem and self-handicapping?  Use a = 0.05, two-tailed, and a critical value of 0.754.  a) Calculate the Pearson's Correlation and show your work.

Then interpret the results of this experiment and make sure to display the statistical results of your correlation in APA format.  c) Find the regression equation for predicting someone's Self-Handicapping score (Y) from their Self-Esteem score.  d) Does the regression equation account for a significant portion of the variance in Self-Handicapping? Use a = 0.05, and critical value of 6.61 to evaluate the F-ratio? State your decision about the null hypothesis and give a Plain English interpretation. You do not need to include effect size in the interpretation.

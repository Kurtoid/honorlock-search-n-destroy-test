Use Functional Equivalence Partitioning Tree to generate test cases  A function takes in three parameters (x, y, z) and calculate the following formula: x, y, and z are float type. Use functional equivalence partitioning approach to design test cases for this function. You should have at least three levels of partition. You must show your functional equivalence partitioning tree. Generate one test case for each leaf node. Some invalid test cases must also be designed.  Simply providing test cases without partitioning is NOT enough. Note each test case should look like:  ((input_x, input_y, input_z), expected_output) For example: ((5.0, 1.2, 1.0), 3.8) ((-1.5, 1.5, -2.0), 1.5) (('a', 'b', 'c'), exception)

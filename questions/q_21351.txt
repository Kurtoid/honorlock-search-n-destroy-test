Case Study #1: Mr. J. is a 48 year old, 5'10", medium frame male who currently weighs 170 lbs (77.3 kg). He has cirrhosis. His UBW for many years prior to being diagnosed with cirrhosis was 160 lbs (~73 kg). He has been admitted to the hospital on previous occasions for treatment of cirrhosis. The underlying cause of his cirrhosis has been attributed to chronic alcoholism. On medical rounds two days after admission to the hospital it was noted that Mr. J had severe ascites. The medical team also noted that Mr. J appeared to be confused (i.e., he did not know where he was, his name or the year), and he had impaired neuromuscular control with asterixis. The nurse reported that he was difficult to arouse when she attempted to take his vital signs. His lab values include a serum albumin of 2.7 g/dl and serum bilirubin (total) of 2.8 mg/dl (normal range: 0.2-1.3 mg/dl). After examination of the patient, the medical team determined that Mr. J. has hepatic encephalopathy. The physician ordered lactulose. A sodium restricted diet was ordered. Which of the following signs/symptoms evident from the information described in the case scenario would have contributed to the medical team's diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy?

Imagine a market with three identical  firms and wherein the  firms maximize profits by setting quantities sequentially. Firm one chooses their output level, which is observed by firms 2 and 3. They are then followed by firm 2, which chooses an optimal output level that is observed by firm 3. Finally, having observed both competitors' output choices, firm 3 decides their profit maximizing level of production. Each firm has a constant marginal cost of production c and no fixed costs. This market is populated by consumers whose inverse demand can be represented by the equation P(Q) = a + bQ. What is the subgame perfect equilibrium of this game? Define the market price (p*) for the output good, as well as the quantity produced by each firm [q1, q2, q3].

(6 pts.)  One of the main benefits that sets REITs apart from other forms of business organization is that REITs do not pay income taxes at the entity level.  List six requirements (other than the 90% taxable income payout requirement mentioned in question 2) that must be met in order to maintain this preferred tax status.    (9 pts.)  Since REITs have to pay out 90% of their taxable income as dividends, they face severe constraints on the amount of internal capital available to pursue new projects.  Discuss three ways that REITs can increase the amount of money they have to grow and expand the company.      a.  (3 pts.)    LIST the three main types of REITs.          b.  (3 pts.)    Most REITs choose to specialize by property type.  Why?       a.  (3 pts.)   LIST the three main investing styles for private equity real estate funds?           b.  (2 pts.)   What are two ways that private equity real estate funds might choose to focus their investments?       a.  (4 pts.)   Overall, why might we consider adding real estate as an asset class to our investment portfolio?           b.  (3 pts.)   Alternatively, why might we choose not to invest in real estate?   6.     Bernoulli SlumLords REIT received rental revenue of $90,000,000 last year. They also had $3,600,000 of income from a management contract for another REIT.  Their Property Operating Expenses were $39,000,000 and their General and Administrative Expenses were $6,000,000.  They had Depreciation and Amortization of $23,000,000 and Interest Expense of $11,000,000.  In addition, they recognized a loss on the sale of real property in the amount of $3,000,000.  The REIT has 4,165,332 shares outstanding and paid a dividend of $4.57/share.  The current shareprice is $49.45/share. a.  (4 pts.)   Given that Bernoulli's GAAP Net Income is $14,600,000, compute their Funds From Operations (FFO). b.  (4 pts.)   Compute the Earnings per Share and the FFO/share. c.  (6 pts.)   Bernoulli's dividend last year was $4.45, which represents the same growth rate for their dividends that has held for many years.  If their shares are currently priced correctly, what does that imply about the market required rate of return for this stock?   7.   Suppose that you find the following information about two possible real estate investments:         Probability   Return on A   Return on B     Bad State   20%   3%   16%     Status Quo   50%   14%   9%     Good State   30%   22%   4%       a.   (8 pts.)   What is the expected return and standard deviation of returns for each individual security? b.   (8 pts.)   You wish to form a portfolio of these two stocks with 50% of the investment in A and 50% of the investment in B.  What would be the expected return and standard deviation of returns for this portfolio? c.   (3 pts.)   How much diversification benefit does this represent?   8.   Suppose that the market value of equity for a particular private equity fund at the beginning of our three-year period of analysis is $527 million. During the first year, they have a cash distribution of $11 million, and they raise an additional $175 million.  All $175 million is used to buy properties.  The market value of equity at the end of the first year is $730 million. a.   (3 pts.)   What is the rate of return for year 1 of our period of analysis? b.   (6 pts.)   Assume the rate of return in year 2 is 3.7% with a cash distribution of $12 million, and the rate of return in year 3 is 10.9% with a cash distribution of $15 million.  This results in a market value of equity at the end of our period of analysis of $1,155.  Compute the overall IRR and the time-weighted return.     A Handy Formula:

The City of Gotham used to be crime-ridden. Since Batman decided to move in to fight crime in the City of Gotham, the crime rate has dropped dramatically. We know that the residents in the city prefer a low crime rate. Let's assume that statistics show that the crime rate is irrelevant for a firm's productivity. As the crime rate declines, (a) (5 pts) How will the population in Gotham change? (b) (5 pts) How will the house price in Gotham change? (c) (10 pts) How will the wage rate in Gotham change? (d) (30 pts) Now, let's assume that a new study finds that a lower crime rate could lead to higher productivity. Using the Rosen-Roback model framework, draw the firm's isoprofit curve and the household's utility curve (indifference curve). In the new equilibrium, how do the isoprofit curve (firm) and the utility curve (household) change due to a lower crime rate? How does the Rosen-Roback model predict the directions of changes in house prices and wages?

Refer to the following Case Study which pertains to unintended consequences of an Arizona state law. Case Study: The goal of an immigration law in the state of Arizona, SB1070 (2010), was to discourage illegal immigration by making it a crime under state law, and directing law enforcement to check immigration status for anyone legally stopped if there was "reasonable suspicion" of illegal status. In addition, it authorized arrest without warrant if the officer had "probable cause" to believe that an offense had been committed, and resulted in the removal of a non-citizen. Most experts believe that this law resulted in a significant decline in the illegal immigrant population in Arizona. If illegal immigrants are a dominate work group in the construction industry in Arizona, what would the effect of this law be on wages for construction workers and new home production costs?

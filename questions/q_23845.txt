During a polymerization reaction of a 1M solution of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (image shown, molecular weight 116 g/mol) in water using a redox initiator system you find that the number average molecular weight that you achieve is 95,000 g/mol. What is the kinetic chain length of the chains formed in this reaction if you assume that 20% of the termination events are caused by disproportionation. By what factor would you have to change the initiator concentration to reach a number average molecular weight of 65,000 g/mol (20 pts). Show your work on scratch paper and write your final answer here.

Questions 4-8 refer to the following map and passage:  Qing Empire, c. 1890 Anti-foreign sentiment resulted in the rapid growth of a Chinese secret society (which had existed for centuries) known as the I Ho Ch'uan (Righteous Harmonious Fists), but referred to by the Westerners as "Boxers." The Boxers called for the expulsion of the "foreign devils" and their Chinese Christian converts. The society stressed the ritualistic use of the martial arts and traditional Chinese weapons. Anti-foreign incidents, including the burning of homes and businesses, increased dramatically in 1898 and 1899, and was primarily directed at Chinese Christians. The number of killings by the Boxers continued to grow, and on 30 December 1899 included a British missionary. Western governments lodged strong protests with the Chinese Dowager Empress, Tzu Hsi. She responded on 11 January 1900, with a declaration that the Boxers represented a segment of Chinese society, and should not be labeled a criminal organization. Her unenthusiastic support for the Chinese Army's attempts at quelling the violence and the influence of Boxer sympathizers at the Imperial court, led Western governments to deploy military forces on the Chinese coast to protect their citizens and interests. --The Boxer Rebellion and the U.S. Navy, 1900-1901 What other global event of the nineteenth century parallels the event identified in the map and the passage?

Emma has created a model with six predictors (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 , x6). She has 60 observations. She found the following ANOVA table.      DF Sum of Squares Mean Sq F p-value   x1     0.002   x2     0.003   x3     0.004   x4   401  0.65   x5   300  0.26   x6   254  0.25   Residuals  [SSEfull]       She would like to remove the last three variables (x4, x5, x6) all at one time, so she ran the model with only the first three variables  (x1, x2, x3).

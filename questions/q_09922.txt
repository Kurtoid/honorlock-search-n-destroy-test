(35 minutes) Exhaust gases at 350degC and a velocity of 4.5 m/s are used to boil water (at atmospheric pressure) flowing through a bank of thin-walled tubes. The tube bank has an aligned array of 12.7 mm-outer diameter, 1.5 m-long tubes with a longitudinal spacing of 19 mm and transverse spacing of 22 mm. There are 16 rows of tubes with 10 tubes in each row. Determine a. The outlet temperature of the exhaust gases b. The total heat transfer rate from the exhaust gases to water For simplicity, calculate the tube-bank Nu using: Nu = 0.7xRe0.5 Exhaust gas properties: cp = 1056 J/kg-K, k = 0.047 W/m-K, m = 3.101 x 10-5 kg/m-s, r = 0.57 kg/m3

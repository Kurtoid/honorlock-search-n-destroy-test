This model would be sold to retailers for $750. The variable cost of this unit is $575. The demand for the new Model D5 is estimated to be 1,700 units per year. Sixty percent of these unit sales of the new model is expected to come from other models already being manufactured by Drone Concepts (20 percent from Model D1, 20 percent from Model D2, 35 percent from Model D3, and 25 percent from Model D4). Drone Concepts will NOT incur any fixed cost to add the new model to the line. Based on the preceding data, should DCI add the new Model D5 to its line of drones? Why or why not?

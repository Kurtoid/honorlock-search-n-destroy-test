Essay Question.  (3pts total) Type your answer using complete sentences to fully answer the question. Describe the general structure of the skin in a few sentences.  Include tissue types. Then, explain the general functions of the skin and make a connection to how the general structure contributes to the general functions.  (for example, take a tin can. the general structure is an empty cylinder of thin metal, with end caps. It's general function is to store wet food of some kind, like a soup or baked beans, while allowing it to still be accessible.  [Here's where the structure-function connection comes in] The empty structure of the can makes it ideal for a container to hold the food and the metal is what lets it keep and seal-off wet foods in storage for long periods of time! and the thinness is what makes it readily accessible to eat with a can-opener or strong stab with a knife.)

In a study of heart surgery, 200 subjects were randomly divided into two groups of 100. One group received a beta-blocker while the other group was given a placebo. The pulse rate at a particular time during the surgery was measured.  Researchers are interested in knowing if beta-blockers reduce the pulse rate at a 5% significance level.    The results are given below.       Population Sample Size Sample Mean  Sample Standard Deviation   1 (Beta-blockers) 100 68.5 7.3   2 (Placebo) 100 70.5 8.6    Complete each space with the appropriate answer Since the researchers [color1], we need a [color2] alternative. We can perform a [color3] since this is a [color4], and sample sizes are [color5]. The SE for the average of group 1 is  [color6], and the SE for the average of group 2 is  [color7], so the SE for the difference of the averages is [color8]. The test statistic is [color9]. The p-value is [color10].  This is [color11] the significance level of 5%, so we will [color12], and conclude that [color13]

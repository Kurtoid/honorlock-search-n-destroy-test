One way to date when a rock was formed (became solid) is to measure the amount of 238U and 206Pb. 238U is the start of a long chain of decay steps that ultimately produce the stable 206Pb isotope. You can assume that all 206Pb atoms in the rock sample were originally 238U atoms. The half-life for 238U is 4.5x109 years.  If a rock sample contains 9[x].[y] mmoles of 238U and 1[w].[z] mmoles of 206Pb, A. How old is the rock in terms of the number of half-lives? Because this question type only allows decimal answers, I'm asking you to express your answer in terms of the number of half-lives, as a decimal number with 3 sig figs and no units, which could be greater or less than 1 half life. For example, the rock could be 34.5 times t1/2 or 0.0345 times t1/2, etc. Show your work in the file you upload for full credit.  If you're not clear what I'm asking for here, include the age of the rock in years using proper scientific notation (and sig figs and units) . Circle or highlight your answer.

Low lighting hair is achieved by applying ________ color onto some of the hair strands.
Lionfish have no natural predators on Florida coral reefs and the local fish populations easily fall subject to predation by the lionfish. The lionfish's favorite food source seems to be young yellowtail snapper on these reefs. Researchers saw that there was an increase in the number of invasive lionfish on the coral reefs over the course of their study. With this increase in invasive predators on the native yellowtail snapper, it was observed that the species abundance of the yellowtail snapper was ___________ due to the influence of a(n) _____________ interaction.

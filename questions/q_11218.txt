For the next 3 problems (#23, 24, 25), use the following fact pattern:    Steven, age 43, earns $80,000 annually; and his wage replacement ratio has been determined to be 80%. He expects inflation will average 3% for his entire life expectancy. He expects to work until 68 and live until 90. He anticipates an 8% return on his investments. Additionally, Social Security Administration has notified him that his annual retirement benefit, in today's dollars will be $26,000.     Using the capital needs / annuity method, calculate how much capital Steven will need to be able to retire at age 68.

Refer to the floor plan shown below.  The loading consists of dead load (D) and live load (L). Beams B1 (span = v) are supported by the perimeter walls and girder G1, girder G2, or girder G3.   Beams B2 (span = v) are supported by column C1 or column C2 at one end and perimeter wall at the other end.  These beams support an interior reinforced concrete wall over a distance = y1. Beams B3 (span = v) are supported by girder G3 and perimeter wall.   Beam B4 (span = y2) is supported by girder G4 and perimeter wall. Beams B5 (span = v) are supported by column C1 or column C2 at one end and perimeter wall at the other end end.  Girder G1 (span = 3l) is supported by perimeter wall at one end column C1 at the other end. Girder G2 (span = 3l) is supported by column C1 and column C2.  This girder supports an interior reinforced concrete wall over its entire length. Girder G3 (span = 3l) is supported by perimeter wall at one end column C2 at the other end. Girder G4 (span = 3l) is supported by beams B2.  This girder supports two reinforced concrete interior walls over a distance = x at each end.   Unfactored D = 45 psf, unfactored L = 50 psf, l = 8 ft, v = 16 ft, y1 = 12 ft, y2 = 4 ft, x = 7 ft, each interior wall is 8 in. thick and 9 ft tall. Assume the design floor load is 120 psf, and the load from an interior wall is 810 lb/ft.  The total load (i.e., the sum of the two reactions) in beam B2 is nearly

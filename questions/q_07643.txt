I, like an usurped town, to another due,                   5 Labor to admit You, but Oh, to no end! Reason, Your viceroy in me, me should defend,  But is captive, and proves weak or untrue. Yet dearly I love You, and would be loved fain,  But am betrothed unto Your enemy:                       10 Divorce me, untie, or break that knot again,  Take me to You, imprison me, for I,  Except You enthrall me, never shall be free,  Nor ever chaste, except You ravish me.                 14   Which line contains a simile?

Given arbitrary sets A, B, and C, complete the given membership table to verify whether the two sets, (A - C) - B and (A - B) - C, are equal. Tip:  For any cells of the table that display beyond the right border of the question box, use the TAB -| key to move from cell to cell, rather than 'clicking' in a cell to make an entry.

The gene for nail patellar syndrome (n = normal allele; N  = mutant allele) shows linkage to the blood group A, B and O alleles (IA = blood type A; IB = blood type B; i = blood type O). The IA and IB alleles both show complete dominance over the i allele. The IA and IB alleles are co-dominant to each other. The two genes are located 10 m.u. apart.

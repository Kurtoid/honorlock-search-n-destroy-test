Albert King is a 68-year-old man with a grade 4 glioblastoma. He has a rapid-onset dense left hemiplegia and is being seen by home care nursing, physical therapy, and occupational therapy under the palliative care program. In June, a craniotomy was done to debulk the tumor. After surgery, he discharged himself, against medical recommendations that he stay for inpatient rehabilitation. On his arrival home, an urgent request was sent to home services to clarify his new mobility/transfer status for the home support workers (HSW). The family members were hoping for intensive in-home rehabilitation and in fact expected Mr. King to walk again. Examination revealed grade 1 to 2 strength in scattered leg muscles and a flaccid left arm. Mr. King was unable to sit unsupported. Standing pivot transfers were maximum lift ' 2, so use of the mechanical lift was recommended. These findings were essentially unchanged from Mr. King's preoperative status. Intensive rehabilitation was not feasible, but the therapist agreed to teach the HSW range of motion and facilitation exercises and see him weekly for ongoing reevaluation. Over the succeeding 3 months, Mr. King has been seen eight times, and there has been no motor or sensory recovery. There have been very small functional gains: Mr. King is now able to roll to his weak side in bed using the bedrail. Mr. King has variable wheelchair sitting tolerance (10-60 minutes). Last week, Mrs. King asked about admission to a rehabilitation facility to capitalize on these gains. Given the information provided in the scenario above, would you say that Mr. King is a good candidate for intensive inpatient rehabilitation?  Why or why not?

Section 13 of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789:
A direct smear on an endocervical specimen revealed intracellular gram-negative, kidney-bean-shaped diplococci.  The specimen was inoculated onto a Modified Thayer-Martin (MTM) Agar plate, and after 24-hours incubation under CO2, grayish-white, translucent, glistening colonies resembling gonococci were observed.  The technologist subcultured the colony to chocolate agar.  Growth from the chocolate agar was used to perform Cysteine Tryptic digest Agar (CTA) carbohydrate utilization tests with glucose, maltose, sucrose, lactose and fructose.  After 24 hours incubation the technologist saw that both glucose and maltose had been degraded.  What is the best next step?

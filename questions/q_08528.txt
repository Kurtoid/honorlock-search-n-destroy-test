A 2.00-kg object is attached to an ideal massless horizontal spring of spring constant 100.0 N/m and is at rest on a frictionless horizontal table. The spring is aligned along the x-axis and is fixed to a peg in the table. Suddenly this mass is struck by another 2.00-kg object traveling along the x-axis at 3.00 m/s, and the two masses stick together. What are the amplitude and period of the oscillations that result from this collision?

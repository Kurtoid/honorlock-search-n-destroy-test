Three  positive charges  of magnitude q = [q] nC are at the three corners of a square of side a = [a] m.  The last corner is occupied by a negative charge of the same magnitude  as the other three charges.   Find the magnitude and direction of the net electric field at the center of the square.  Hint: pay attention to the units, conversions, and significant figures. Draw a vector diagram with an x-y coordinate system. Label all the fields. Give the direction as an angle with respect to the +x axis in the CCW direction.   Enter only the magnitude below. Use three (3) significant figures and do not include the units here, but make sure you include the units in the work you upload.   Points will be taken off if you do not provide your final value of the net field here before you submit your test.   After you submit your test, you have 15 minutes to scan and email me your work as PDF. Include a vector diagram and all the steps in your calculation.

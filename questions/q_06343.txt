You can go walking, hiking, biking, horse riding and wildlife viewing. You may be lucky enough to see rare bearded and Cape vultures as well as eland, oribi, and other highland fauna in their natural habitat. If you are lucky, you may even get the opportunity to feed the vultures. You can also head into Clarens to potter about the craft shops and, in season, stock up on cherries from Ficksburg. When tired of all the activity, you can head back to your log cabin for an afternoon siesta. Or you can sit on the wide balcony and gaze out into the distance. There is also the two-day, 28 kilometer Ribbok Hiking Trail. For this trail one must be fit as on the second day of the trail you will climb "Generaalskop", which is a climb of 1100 meters.

Fluid Flies  Cell membranes balance the need to remain intact with the need to move during function. Researchers studying fruit flies discovered that the cell membranes of these ectothermic animals changed throughout the day. During the night, when the environment was cool, the membranes were composed of mostly unsaturated phospholipids, leading to a very flexible structure. During the day, when the environment was warm, the membranes were composed of mostly saturated phospholipids, leading to a less flexible structure.    Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 21-25.   21. The change in the structure of the membrane is likely a case of adaptive plasticity.

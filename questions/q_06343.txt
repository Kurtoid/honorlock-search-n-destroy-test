(i) Using the function randint() from the random library, write a function ranlist(M,N) to create and return a list of M random integers which lie in the interval from -N to N, where M and N are inputs to the function. (ii) Create a function mymax(a) to find and return the maximum entry in a list a. (iii) Write a function mysort(a) to sort a random list of integers from smallest to largest. You may find your code for mymax() is helpful. (v) Create a test script to test these functions; the script should call each function in turn.      (a) Create and print a random list of 100 integers which lie in the interval from -1000-1000   (b) Find and print the maximum value in the list.      (c) Sort the list in ascending order and print the sorted list   Upload your completed .py file (here) and .txt file (Q6).

Many companies that manufacture lightbulbs advertise their 60-watt bulbs as having an average life of 1000 hours. A cynical consumer bought 30 bulbs and burned them until they failed. He found that they burned for an average of M = 1233 hours, with a standard deviation of s = 232.06 hours. What statistical test would this consumer use to determine whether the average burn time of lightbulbs differs significantly from that advertised?

In chickens, an organizer called the ZPA normally forms on the posterior edge of the developing forelimb bud and produces a morphogen that specifies the identity of the three distinct digits, with the most posterior digit forming closest to the ZPA and the anterior most digit forming furthest away. Consider a chick embryo that carries a mutation that causes the ZPA to develop on the anterior edge of the limb bud rather than the posterior edge. What would you expect the digits in this chick limb to look like?

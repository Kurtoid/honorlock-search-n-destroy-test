Piezometers are used to measure soil water potentials at two points in the soil on a vertical profile, within the saturated zone. Piezometer A length, from the surface to point A is 1.5 m, and the pressure potential recorded at A was 0.7 m. Piezometer B length, from the surface to point B is 1.0 m, and the pressure potential at B was 0.5 m. What is the soil water potential at each point relative to the soil surface and in what direction is the water flowing?

Q1A (5 points): Gelsolin is a protein that caps the fast growing (barbed) end of actin filaments.  In a particular solution, when magnesium is added, the critical concentration of actin is 0.2 uM, the critical concentration of the barbed end is 0.1 uM, and the critical concentration of the slow growing (pointed) end is 1.0 uM. If enough gelsolin is added to an unpolymerized actin solution so that the gelsolin concentration is 0.0001 uM (only enough to cap a small portion of the microfilaments that form) and the actin concentration is 0.8 uM. Magnesium is added to stimulate polymerization. How much actin remains unpolymerized at steady state? Please briefly explain your answer.     Q1B (5 points): In a solution of pure actin under polymerizing conditions soluble ATP levels go down and ADP levels go up. This occurs much more slowly in a solution of pure actin that is maintained under non-polymerizing conditions. Please explain this result.

Risk Element  MinimumCost Estimate   MaximumCost Estimate    Element 1              $970,000            $1,070,000   Element 2              $950,000            $1,100,000    Which of these elements is riskier (i.e. the accuracy of the estimate is more sensitive to this element)?

The rotational period of Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, is about 6 days. The mass of Sirius is twice the mass of the Sun and its radius is 1.75 times the radius of the Sun. A) What is Sirus' angular velocity in rad/s? (3 pts) Suppose that Sirius runs out of nuclear fuel and suddenly collapses to form a so-called white dwarf star. Assuming no mass loss and that the moment of inertia of a collapsing spinning star changes to one-third of its initial value. B) What would be the new radius of Sirius? (3 pts)     Treat Sirius as a uniform, solid sphere (). MSun = 1.9x1030 kg, RSun = 6.96x108 m.

The alleles his-5 and lys-1 found in baker's yeast results in cells that require histidine and lysine for growth. A cross was made between two haploid yeast stains that are his-5 lys-1 and his+lys+. From the analysis of 500 individuals tetrads, the following numbers were obtained: 1 spore: his-5 lys-1 +     1 spore: his-5 lys+    +    1 spore: h is+ lys-1      1 spore: his+lys+  =300 2 spores: his-5 lys+  + 2 spores:his+ lys-1  =50 2 spores: his-5 lys-1  + 2 spores:his+  lys+  =150 Compute map distance between two genes.

3 Groundwater Flow Two wells have been installed in the surficial aquifer of GFW (see figure below). They are 500m apart and the west well (well A) has a water table elevation of 50 m (above sea level) and the well on the east boundary (well B) has a water table elevation of 40 m. Ksat for this coarse sandy aquifer is 10 m/d.  Additional wells (not shown) on the north and south boundaries  show no water table slope from North to South (i.e. flow is entirely in the A-to-B or west-to-east direction).  Assume the potentiometric gradient and Ksat are uniform across the watershed, and that no water leaks through the confining unit below.

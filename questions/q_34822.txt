An implementation of RSA performs exponentiation by going through the exponent one bit at a time. For a bit in the exponent, it squares the result - this is done regardless of what the value of the exponent's bit is. Then, only if the exponent's bit is tested, the result is multiplied with the message (in this code, exp, res, and msg are large numbers, and each of them occupies thousands of bytes in memory): // For each bit in the exponentfor(int bit_idx=nbits-1; bit_idx>=0; bit_idx--){   BN_sqr(res,res); // res=res*res;   // Get bit_idx'th bit from large number exp   bool bit= get_bit_at_index(exp,bit_idx);   if(bit)      BN_mul(res,res,msg); // res=res*msg} While Betty is using this RSA implementation to sign a message, Evan is running his attack application on the same server, so that Betty's RSA signing program and Evan's attack program share the cache. Before Evan can successfully perform a Prime+Probe attack and discover Betty's secret exponent, he needs to know (or find out) a few facts. Answer the following questions:  Evan needs to know (or write test programs that measure) a few parameters of the cache on the server system. Name at least one property of the server's cache hardware that Evan really must know. Explain why Evan must know the value of that cache property. Evan needs to know something about the data use in the large-number exponentiation code use by Betty. Name at least one variable and at least one property of that variable that Evan must know. Explain why Evan must know that specific fact about that specific variable.

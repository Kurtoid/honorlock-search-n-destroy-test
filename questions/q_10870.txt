A group of students has been trained to increase their score on the math segment of the S.A.T.  For the general population, S.A.T.-Math scores have the normal distribution with u=505 and s=105. It is reasonable to assume that the shape of the distribution is unchanged by training effects, but is shifted, hopefully to the right. It follows that we assume that s =105. For a random sample, of size n=25 the sample mean (sM) S.A.T.-math score is 559. Select a null and alternative hypothesis to determine if there is support for the contention that the training improves S.A.T. verbal scores at the a =.05 level of significance. ?   Find null and alternative hypotheses for this test. The answer is in the form (Ho, Ha).  Save your answer for the next problem.

Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr A sample of gas collected at 21.0degC and 0.868 atm, has a volume of 1.83 liters.  What volume will the gas occupy if the temperature is increased to 38.0degC and the pressure is reduced to 0.658 atm?  To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem.  Be sure to include the answer. Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

A chemist makes a solution by dissolving 0.261 g of oxalic acid (H2C2O4; molar mass = 90.0349 g/mol) in 250.0 mL of water. Oxalic acid is diprotic, so the balanced neutralization reaction is as follows: H2C2O4(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) - Na2C2O4(aq) + 2H2O(l) The oxalic acid solution was titrated with sodium hydroxide and it was determined that 73.4 mL of base was added to reach the equivalence point - what is the concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution?

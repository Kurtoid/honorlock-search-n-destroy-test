Problem 3 (10 points) The Anju Company produces and sells 7,500 modular computer desks per year at a selling price of $750 each. Its current production equipment, purchased for $1,500,000 and with a four-year useful life, is only one-year old. It has a terminal disposal value of $0 and is depreciated on a straight-line basis. The equipment has a current disposal price of $400,000. However, the emergence of a new molding technology has led Anju to consider either upgrading or replacing the production equipment. The following table presents data for the two alternatives:           Replace   Upgrade     One-time equipment costs   $   4,500,000   $   2,000,000     Variable manufacturing cost per desk   $   70   $   100     Remaining useful life of equipment (years)       3       3     Terminal disposal value of equipment   $   5,000   $   0       Required:    Should Anju upgrade its production line or replace it? Show your calculations. (6 points) Assume that the capital expenditures to replace and upgrade the production equipment are as given in the original exercise, but that the production and sales quantity is not known. For what production and sales quantity would Anju prefer to (i) upgrade the equipment or (ii) replace the equipment? (4 points)

Who is the author of the following passage? The sexes should not only correspond to and appreciate one another, but prophesy to one another. In individual instances this happens. Two persons love in one another the future good which they aid one another to unfold. This is very imperfectly done as yet in the general life.

But let anyone defy their taunts, break through, and be brave and secure, they rend the air with shouts.

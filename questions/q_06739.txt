Lecture Test 3, Question 20 The series of diagrams below illustrates the outcome of potential competition between two species of birds relative to two components of their niche: feeding position on a tree limb and ripeness of fruit.  The illustration in the upper left shows the boundaries for these two niche components in the absence of competition for one species (blue).  The illustration in the upper right show the boundaries for these two niche components in the absence of competition for the other species (red).  The illustration in the lower left plots the niche component boundaries together (overlaid) assuming no competition.  The illustration in the lower right shows niche component boundaries under competition.         a.  Why is the zone of actual competition (lower right illustration) less than the zone of potential competiton (lower left illustration)?       b.  Is the "blue" species expressing a fundamental niche or a realized niche?  Explain or defend your response.
What structure is identified by 'D'?

Gallilee St. Peter's fish is a mouth-brooding fish, in which one parent holds the brood in its mouth during the course of their development; thus, an individual can only care for one clutch of eggs at a time. This behavior comes at a cost to growth (they can't eat while they're mouth-brooding!), and female fecundity is strongly related to body size. When female:male sex ratios are low, mouth-brooding is done by the male. However, when females greatly outnumber males in the population, females are more likely to mouth-brood. A) What is the benefit of providing parental care? (Regardless of which sex does it.) B) It takes the same amount of time and energy for males or females to provide parental care.  What are the consequences/costs of engaging in mouth-brooding behavior for females?  For males? C) Use your answer to B to explain why males provide parental care when there is a low female:male sex ratio, and why females provide care when there is a high female:male sex ratio. (HINT: be careful to avoid group selection explanations!)

The practice manager has asked you to run a report using PM software that shows all patient accounts that are in arrears. You understand this to mean:
A three-year bond with 10 percent coupon rate and $1,000 face value yields 8 percent. Assuming annual coupon payments, calculate the price of the bond.
Upon assessing your patient you find that this patient has an abundance of plaque, poor oral home care, bleeding on probing, and moderate radiographic bone loss. The patient has no history of periodontal treatment. The patient had orthodontic treatment as a teenager and states that he grinds his teeth in his sleep. Which of the following categories of plaque-induced gingivitis does this patient most likely have?
Rate S, Ba, F,  and Sn, from greatest electronegativity to least electronegativity
a) (8 pts) We discussed the effects of grain size to different mechanical properties extensively throughout the semester. In general, with the decrease of grain size, the strength increases, and the ductility/toughness decreases due to the fact that grain boundary can pin dislocation motion. However, in some extreme conditions, grain boundary can promote deformation through grain boundary migration. This phenomenon may dominate the deformation when (1) grain size approaches nanometer range; (2) at high temperature.  The schematic shows the typical Charpy impact curve for a coarse grain ferritic steel (grain size 30-80 mm).  By considering the possible effect from grain boundary migration, please draw the behavior of (a) fine grain steel (grain size 1-10 mm); and (b) nano grain steel (grain size < 100 nm). Note: you need to clearly show the changes of ductile-brittle transition temperature, upper shelf and lower shelf values.      b) (7 pts) Below are the fracture images taken from the impact test. Please identify which is from low temperature test and which is from high temperature test.

Destabilization due to gauche interactions is observed in the di-equatorial chair conformer of trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexanes (illustrated below). If the energetic penalty of the CH3/CH3 gauche interaction is 3.80 kJ/mol and the DGdeg (eq to ax) for a CH3 group is 7.28 kJ/mol, what is the difference in energy between the di-axial and di-equatorial chair forms of trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane? Report your answer to two decimal places in kJ/mol and do not include the units or the algebraic sign.

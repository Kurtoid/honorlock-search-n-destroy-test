Kick Scooters Metal frames for kick scooters are manufactured in two steps: Stamping and assembly. Each frame is made up of three pieces: one unit of part A and two units of part B.   The parts are fabricated by a single stamping machine that requires a set up time of 90 minutes switching between two part types. Once the machine is set up, the activity time for parts, regardless of type, is 30 seconds each piece.  Currently, the stamping machine rotates its production between one batch of 120 part A's and 240 part B's. Completed parts move only when the entire batch is produced. At assembly, parts are assembled manually to form the finished products. The three parts and a number of small purchased components are required for each unit of final product. Each product requires 30 minutes of labor time to assemble. There are 12 workers in assembly. There is sufficient demand to sell every scooter the system can make. At the current batch sizes, what is the capacity of stamping (in units per hour)

CASE 3: Harold, a 58-year old grocery store manager, had recently been waking up in the middle of the night with abdominal pain. This was happening several nights a week. He was also experiencing occasional discomfort in the middle of the afternoon. His appetite had suffered as a result of the pain, so his doctor referred him to a physician specializing in internal medicine. The physician performed an endoscopy during which a long tube was inserted into Harold's mouth and directed into his digestive tract. The end of the tube was equipped with a light source and a small camera which allowed the doctor to observe the interior of Harold's stomach. The endoscope was also equipped with a small claw-like structure that the doctor used to obtain a small tissue sample from the lining of Harold's stomach.

Rock pocket mice live in the deserts of the American southwest. Ancestral pocket mice all had light-colored coats that blended in with the region's rocks and sandy soil, keeping the mice hidden from predatory owls. About 1.7 million years ago, a series of volcanic eruptions spewed out wide trails of black lava into the middle of rock pocket mouse territory. Currently there are two color morphs of rock pocket mice: light-colored mice that are typically found in habitats with sandy soil, and dark-colored mice that are typically found in habitats with dark-colored lava rocks.     A) Light- and dark-colored mice survive in many environments because they are able to avoid predation by moving into tunnels.       B) Light-colored mice are more likely to survive than dark-colored mice in habitats with lava rocks and sandy soil.       C) Light-colored mice are significantly more susceptible to predation by owls in habitats with lava rocks than in habitats with sandy soil.       D) Dark-colored mice are more likely to survive than light-colored mice in habitats with lava rocks and sandy soil.

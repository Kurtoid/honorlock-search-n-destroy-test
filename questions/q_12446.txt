3.  Assume you have a random sample containing the following four data points:  31, 28, 40, and 33.  (You might find it helpful to use Excel for this problem.)  If the answer is not exact, give your answer rounded to three digits to the right of the decimal. a.   What is the sample mean? [mean] b.  What is the unbiased estimate for the variance of the underlying distribution? [var] c.  In forming the 95% confidence interval, you would use either a z statistic or a t statistic.  What was its value?   [stat]  d.  Using the values that you have for answers to parts a, b, and c, give the upper limit for the 95% confidence interval for the mean?  [upper]

A municipal 911 ambulance system in a large city has an average response time of 15 minutes for the category of Priority 1 incidents which includes call types such as cardiac arrest and shooting.  The average of 15 minutes is true for both the citywide average and the average for each of 15 distinct neighborhoods comprising the city.  To promote patient well-being, suppose the validated standard for response time is an average of 5 minutes to Priority 1 incidents.  This set of evidencewould suggest that with respect to average response time for Priority 1 incidents citywide and across particular neighborhoods that the system is:  (partial hint - no measure of ambulance unit busyness or workload provided here; nor is there any measure here on how reasonable the deployment scheme for when and where units are scheduled.)

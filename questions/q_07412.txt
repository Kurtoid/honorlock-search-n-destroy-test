A  vinyl record rotates freely about a vertical axis through it center with an angular speed of 6.0 rad/s. The record has a radius of 0.10 m and a mass of M and can be considered to be a uniform disk. Putty of mass M drops vertically onto the record from above and sticks to the edge of the record.

Exhibit 3-2 Suppose that at a given price level the following values exist in a hypothetical classical economy.                                                 Consumption = $2,000 billion                                                 Investment = $900 billion                                                 Government Purchases = $700 billion                                                 Exports = $200 billion                                                 Imports = $300 billion Assume that the level of total expenditures is equal to the value of goods and services that suppliers want to sell.  Refer to Exhibit 3-2. If saving increases by $300 billion the new level of consumption will equal ________________.  According to classical economist, investment would _______________ and total expenditures would _______________.

A study was conducted to assess the effects that occur when children are exposed to cocaine before birth. Children were tested at age 4 for assembly skills, which was described as "a task requiring visual-spatial skills related to mathematical competence".  The 190 children born to cocaine users had a mean of 7.3 and a standard deviation of 3.  The 186 children not exposed to cocaine had a mean score of 8.2 with a standard deviation of 3.  Assume the distributions of scores for children exposed and not exposed to cocaine have the same amounts of variation.  Use 5% significance level to test the claim that prenatal cocaine exposure is associated with lower scores of 4-year old children on the test assembly.  Classify this problem.

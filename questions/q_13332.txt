In a species of salamander, there are two different forms: red striped and yellow striped. Both are quite tasty.  In one area, the yellow form was quite common, and the red form was rare.  Because of this, predators ate more yellow salamanders and were thus more likely to identify the yellow salamanders (over the red) as tasty food.  This continued until the yellow salamanders were eaten so heavily that the red striped form began to outnumber them.  As the red salamanders become more common, and yellows rare, the predators were more likely to eat the red ones...and the yellow form was less likely to be eaten (and more likely to survive and reproduce).

Answer the following question based on the following scenarioYou ask for a guest tray but all the plates have been used. The diet aide takes a dirty dish and washed it off in the sink and hands it to the cook to plate the food on. You follow the tray cart down to the unit which leaves the kitchen at 11:30am. As you wait for all the trays to be delivered so you can take your guest tray, you notice no one is available to start serving the trays. At 11:50, a nurse aide begins passing out trays. As you observe her passing out trays, you notice she set up a tray in a room where the patient was not back from therapy yet. In the next room, she set up the tray on the bedside table which was not in reach of the patient and in the third room the patient was given the wrong tray. When the patient made the nursing aide aware it was the wrong tray, she took the tray out and delivered it to the right patient across the hall. At 12:30, all the trays were delivered and you take your guest tray to audit it. The tray is a pureed diet, temperature of the meat and vegetable were under recommendations for serving.

Abagnale Industries has a special contract with the European Union to provide the ink used for printing Euros.  On January 1, 2003 Abagnale purchased and opened a plant in New Rochelle, New York to produce the ink.  Because the ink can be toxic, there are strict state rules regarding the clean up of the site after the plant is shut down.  At the time of opening, Abagnale estimates that they will have to pay $8,250,000 in 15 years to restore the site.  They will also be required to pay an additional fee of $500,000 for inspection of the site (to confirm that it is cleaned).  The company estimates that their risk adjusted rate of return is 4% and expect to close the plant after 15 years.  a. (8 points) Record the asset retirement obligation and all other required journal entries for 2003 (you don't need to record the plant purchase and assume straight-line depreciation). Date the journal entries.  b. (4 points) At the conclusion of the 15-year period, Abagnale closed the facility and completed the restoration for $8,400,000. Because of changes to the laws, the required $500,000 inspection fee was waved.  Record the final journal entry for the restoration at the end of the 15-year period.

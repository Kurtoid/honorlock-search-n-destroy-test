Use a small, dark filled-in circle as the symbol to represent the octahedral interstitial atom. Write down the coordinates of the octahedral interstitial atom you have drawn in the cube on your worksheet. (3 pts) Using small open circle symbols, now add all the nearest neighbor atoms that also serve as lattice points.  Do NOT include any lattice points in the BCC unit cell that do NOT serve as nearest neighbor atoms for your chosen octahedral interstitial atom. Now, derive the (theoretical) maximum ratio of radii between an octahedral interstitial atom and an atom positioned at a lattice point in a BCC unit cell. Show all work including neat, clear schematics to illustrate any relevant geometry relationships. (6 pts)

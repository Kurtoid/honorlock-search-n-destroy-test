A weather balloon contains 12.0 m3 of hydrogen gas when the balloon is released from a location at which the temperature is 30.0degC and the pressure is 80.0 kPa. The balloon rises to a location where the temperature is -10.0degC and the pressure is 20.0 kPa. If the balloon is free to expand so that the pressure of the gas inside is equal to the ambient pressure, what is the new volume of the balloon? Assume that in both cases the hydrogen gas is in thermal equilibrium with the outside air.

Case Study #1: Mr. J. is a 48 year old, 5'10", medium frame male who currently weighs 170 lbs (77.3 kg). He has cirrhosis. His UBW for many years prior to being diagnosed with cirrhosis was 160 lbs (~73 kg). He has been admitted to the hospital on previous occasions for treatment of cirrhosis. The underlying cause of his cirrhosis has been attributed to chronic alcoholism. On medical rounds two days after admission to the hospital it was noted that Mr. J had severe ascites. The medical team also noted that Mr. J appeared to be confused (i.e., he did not know where he was, his name or the year), and he had impaired neuromuscular control with asterixis. The nurse reported that he was difficult to arouse when she attempted to take his vital signs. His lab values include a serum albumin of 2.7 g/dl and serum bilirubin (total) of 2.8 mg/dl (normal range: 0.2-1.3 mg/dl). After examination of the patient, the medical team determined that Mr. J. has hepatic encephalopathy. The physician ordered lactulose. A sodium restricted diet was ordered. All of the following contribute to the development of ascites in a patient with cirrhosis EXCEPT:

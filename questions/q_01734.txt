An instructional resources company claims to have a method to train students which will increase their scores on any standardized test. Concerned that their admission process would be adversely affected, a large university decides to test this claim. The registrar selects, using a method which is independent and random, a group of n =200 high school students. This group is randomly divided in two, n1=100 students are sent to be trained to increase their test scores and n2=100 students are shown an inspirational movie to act as a control group.             After training both groups are administered an old PDQ. test, the following results are obtained Sample mean 1=257 and sample mean 2=249. To interpret the results the following assumptions are made:               a. The distribution of the scores before training was normal N (250, 50)            b.      Any changes due to training represent a change in the location of the mean                      rather the shape of the distribution, hence s1 = s2 = 50   Test Ho: u1 = u2 vs. Ha: u1 > u2  at the a =.05 level of significance.   The following triple (z-score, p-value, Your Conclusion) is produced when the data is properly input in to your calculator.

(i) Using the function randint() from the random library, write a function ranlist(M,N) to create and return a list of M random integers which lie in the interval from -N to N, where M and N are inputs to the function. (ii) Create a function mymax(a) to find and return the maximum entry in a list a. (iii) Write a function mysort(a) to sort a random list of integers from smallest to largest. You may find your code for mymax() is helpful. (v) Create a test script to test these functions; the script should call each function in turn.      (a) Create and print a random list of 100 integers which lie in the interval from -1000-1000   (b) Find and print the maximum value in the list.      (c) Sort the list in ascending order and print the sorted list   Upload your completed .py file (here) and .txt file (Q6).

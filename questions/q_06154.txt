When is the object represented by the graph above moving in the positive direction? The graph is Velocity vs. Clock Reading.  From 0 s - 3 s, the graph is a horizontal line at the velocity = 1 m/s mark.  Between 3 s and 6 s, the graph decreases linearly to a velocity reading of -2 m/s, crossing the Clock Reading axis at t = 4 s. From 6 s to 8 s, the graph is a horizontal line.  From 8 s to 10 s, the graph is a line that increases from -2 m/s to 0 m/s.

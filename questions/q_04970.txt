Show work on your paper and submit on the last problem of this test.          f(x) = 2x4 - 7x3 + x2 + 16x - 12 Find all zeros of the polynomial (do not use fractions - use decimals and do not round). Show work if synthetic division is needed.  List multiple zeros in order from least to greatest using commas to separate and no spaces. If a zero has a multiplicity other than one write in parentheses (mult 2, or mult 3,...)after you list the zero with no space.  i.e. -7(mult 2),-5,1(mult 3)  a) Zeros: [z]   Parts b)-e) are only on your "graph paper". No answers are entered here. b) Write each function as a product of linear factors.  c) Write the domain of f(x) using interval notation on the paper. d) Write the range of f(x) using interval notation on the paper. e) Graph the polynomial function on the graph paper you printed prior to the test. Be sure to include exact ordered pairs (dots) for zeros, intercepts, maximums or minimums.

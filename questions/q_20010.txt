The following questions refer to the diagram below. The solutions in the two arms of the U-tube are separated at the bottom of the tube by a selectively permeable membrane.

The membrane is permeable to water and to sodium and chloride ions, but not to glucose. The apparatus is allowed to stand for three days.      The fluid level on Side X will rise because the water molecules on that side at the beginning of the experiment have more free energy than those on Side Y.

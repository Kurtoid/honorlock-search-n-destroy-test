Calculate the number of moles of gas in a 45.0 L container at 25.0degC and 0.762 atm.  (Chapter 10)
A perfect score on a particular test is 100. Students' test score distribution shows a fair amount of spread. Each question is worth five points. The lowest score is 35, the mean is 55, the median is 55, the mode is 55, the standard deviation is 10, and the range is 50. What is the highest score in the distribution of test scores based on the information provided?

Answer BOTH of the following questions. Make sure to label each answer to match the corresponding question using number and letter (I-A, I-B). Suggested time: 45 minutes.  I-A.   Descriptive statistics for student final exam scores in a class (N=24) have a mean of 16.3, and a standard deviation of 4.2.  Give the 90% confidence interval for the mean. 1-B.  In a study of psychotherapy treatment methods for mild depression, three treatment groups are compared.  One group of patients receives a form of interpersonal therapy (IPT), a second group gets "pharmacotherapy" (management of the depression with drugs), and a third group gets a combination of IPT and pharmacotherapy.  Patients are evaluated for seriousness of their depression when they enroll in treatment, using the Ham-D scale (a score of >13 indicates depression).   The outcome variable is Ham-D score after 16 weeks of psychotherapy, although scores on the Beck Depression Inventory are also taken at the 16-week mark. The researchers analyzed these data using a mixed-model ANOVA, a repeated-measures design, with factors Group and Time (with levels 1 = week 0, 2 = week 16).  The Group factor has three levels: IPT (interpersonal therapy), DR (pharmacotherapy or treatment with drugs), and IPD (combine IPT and drug management).  SPSS output from this analysis is shown on the following pages. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores at week 16 are recorded in variable BDI16. SPSS Output.pdf   The researchers have the following research questions. RQ1:  Do the three types of therapy differ in their effectiveness? RQ2a: Which therapy treatment works best?   RQ2b: Is that type of therapy effective in decreasing depression scores? For each research question above, write a short paragraph giving your answer to the question. Support your conclusions with statistical evidence, taken or computed from the SPSS output on the next page.  Try to use APA format for presenting this statistical evidence.  Note that for questions RQ1 and RQ2b you should be reporting and discussing inferential tests.   If the researchers want to answer RQ1 and RQ2 using the Beck Depression Inventory scores at week 16 (variable Beck16) as the outcome instead of Ham-D scores, what statistical technique or design would be best? For RQ1, what specific test results would you look at to obtain an inferential test of the question? For RQ2, what specific test results would you look at to obtain an inferential test of the question(s)?

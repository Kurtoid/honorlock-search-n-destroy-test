GnRH stimulates the pituitary gland to create which two hormones?
A suspension of yeast cells is being grown under anaerobic conditions such that glucose is degraded to ethanol and carbon dioxide.Adding an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase to the yeast cell suspension results in rapid cell death. Why?   a) Pyruvate is no longer being produced for use in gluconeogenesis, so the cells quickly deplete this energy source.   b) Loss of this enzyme during anaerobic glucose degradation leads to an increased requirement for ATP, which cannot be met.   c) NADH generated during glycolysis cannot be recycled back to NAD+, thus anaerobic ATP production through glycolysis cannot be maintained.   d) Without alcohol dehydrogenase, the acetaldehyde concentration increases to levels that are toxic to the yeast cells.

A student set up an experiment where pieces of Elodea plant were placed in different test tubes and sodium bicarbonate solution was added. One of the tubes was wrapped in aluminum foil before both tubes were placed in front of a bright white light. Volumeters were placed on top and the volume was read every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. The results can be seen in the table below. Select the correct response below to explain your data.    Time (minutes) Volumeter A Volumeter B   0 25 24   10 25 50   20 19 74   30 13 99

The following summary data came from an experiment on the arsenic concentration (micrograms/L) in a nearby lake. Assume that the arsenic concentration is normally distributed and the sample data contains no outliers.           n         Sample Mean           s          12            14.30                  0.85 a. Calculate a 95% confidence lower bound for the true average arsenic concentration in the lake. Lower bound = [LB] b. Is it plausible that the true average arsenic concentration could be 13 (micrograms/L)? Explain your answer. Yes or No: [no] Explanation: [explain]

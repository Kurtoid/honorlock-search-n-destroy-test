As you know, eukaryotes lack operons such as those found in prokaryotes.  However, the organization of the ChAT/VAChT gene locus in Drosophila has some similarities to a prokaryotic operon.  Both the ChAT and VAChT protein products are required in neurons - ChAT encodes an enzyme that synthesizes acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter; VAChT encodes an acetylcholine transporter protein that packages acetylcholine so it can be released from the neuron. In most multicellular eukaryotes, these two protein products are produced from genes at different loci in the genome.  In flies, however, that's not the case. A diagram of the Drosophila ChAT/VAChT gene locus and the RNAs produced from that locus are shown below.  There is a single regulatory region, a single primary RNA, and two mature mRNAs produced from the locus. In the mature mRNAs, black rectangles represent exons, and thin lines represent the former position of an intron. AUG indicates the translational start site, the stop codon and polyA signal sequence are not shown.  You can see the two mRNAs share a common first exon. Nucleotide sequences that are aligned vertically share the same sequence.  A) In what ways is the organization of the ChAT/VAChT locus SIMILAR to a bacterial operon (2-3 sentences max)? (5 pts) B) Why is the structural organization of this locus DIFFERENT from a bacterial operon (2-3 sentences max)? (5 pts) C) Based on the information above, how much of the ChAT and VAChT PROTEIN SEQUENCE will be the same (express your answer as a percentage)? (5 pts)

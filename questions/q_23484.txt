Tony is the sole trustee of an trust created by Sue.  Ben, 25 years old, is the sole beneficiary of the trust.  Among the items of trust property is a large and valuable collection of gold coins, which comprises one-fourth of the value of the trust.  Under the terms of the trust, the trustee is directed to preserve the coin collection intact and turn it over to Ben when Ben reaches age 30.  For two years, Tony has kept the coin collection in a locked safe in his office, and his office is equipped with a silent alarm system.  Tony would periodically monitor the value of the coins and report the ever-increasing value to Ben.  Ben always told Tony that he liked the fact that the coins were in Tony's office because it was convenient for Ben to occasionally visit Tony's office, take the coins out of the safe, examine and admire them, and then return them to the safe.  During a widespread late-night power failure that disabled Tony's alarm system, thieves broke into Tony's office, forced open the safe, and stole the entire coin collection.  Tony held off telling Ben about the theft, hoping the police would recover the coins.  Ben found out about the theft six months later on one of his occasional visits to inspect the coins.  Ben timely brings suit against Tony alleging breach of fiduciary duty.  On which of the following claims is Ben most likely to prevail?

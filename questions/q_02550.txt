Suppose U-Mobile covers the service region shown in the figure below. There are 22 cells in the region, numbered 0 - 21. The center cell is A at position 0.  The frequency reuse is N=3 and alpha = 3.  Suppose cell number 12 becomes overloaded with users so that U-Mobile places a micro tower at the center of the cell at position 12. The microcell has the same frequency band as cell A. Calculate the received power, Prmicro(R) from the micro-tower in cell 12 that is experienced at the boundary of cell A.  Assume the frequency of operation is 800MHz, the transmitter and receiver gains are 4dBi and 3dBi, respectively, R =1km, and alpha = 3. The transmission power for the microcell is Pr,micro = 3W.      Answer format: The received power at R from the micro tower is: ____________ dBW

Directions: Read the following passage, analyze the graphs, and then answer the questions that follow.  Population Growth and Damage from Hurricanes The East Coast of the United States has attracted millions of new residents and vacationers over the past several decades.  There are now almost 50 million people who live year-round on shorelines from Texas to Maine, especially in the Sunbelt (from Texas through North Carolina).  The East Coast is also in the path of many hurricanes, and the increase in population has led not only to more costly damage when hurricanes strike, as shown in the graphs below, but also to problems evacuating people.  The development of new roads along the shoreline has not kept pace with population growth, making evacuation difficult.  In addition, there have been fewer serious hurricanes since 1980 than there were in the previous three decades, so many people do not take hurricane warnings seriously enough and may delay leaving in an evacuation.

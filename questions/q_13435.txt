You are attempting to purify a novel ATPase from the halophilic archaeal species Halobacterium salinarium. This unique enzyme is comprised of 32 distinct, independent gene products (making cloning and expression of each gene intractable, and well, impossible) yielding a complex of ~1 mDa with a high affinity for ATP. You do not know the sequence of these gene products but rationalize that like many halophilic proteins, this complex is predicted to be composed of acidic proteins  a) In attempting to use affinity chromatography (An ATP-sepharose column) you find that your protein does not bind to the column. If all the buffers are good, and pH is appropriate, provide two potential rationales for why affinity chromatography might not work. b) Ruling out affinity chromatography, provide a detailed description of a multi-step procedure (at least three) that you would use to purify this enzyme complex (take nothing for granted, explain all).

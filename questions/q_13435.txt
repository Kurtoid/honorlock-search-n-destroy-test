Indications: Rule out possible pneumonia. Progressive shortness of breath and daily cough; some weight loss over the past few months. No old films available for comparison. HPI: The patient presents with increasing difficulty breathing. Approximately 2 weeks ago, the patient had what he termed a brief "head cold" that lasted for 3 days, in which he had decreased energy and appetite. This event included nasal discharge that was yellow in appearance and then improved, though he still notes occasional clear discharge. At that time, he developed a cough, which was worse in the a.m. and improved throughout the day. He notes that the cough has worsened in recent days, in which he brings up occasional yellow-green sputum. He notes pain and tightness on inspiration, which can cause a bout of coughing. He denies fever, chills, or night sweats. He also denies any recent travel outside of the area and has lived here his entire life. The patient also notes a 40 pack-year history of smoking [one pack a day for 40 years], though he has not smoked in the past 5 years. He also notes that he spent some time working as a steamfitter in environments where he was exposed to chemicals that were aerosolized, as well as possibly exposed to asbestos.

Dustin, Jean and Michael decide to form a DJM consulting firm that advises companies on employment hiring issues (they do background checks, etc.) They decide to make it a General Partnership (GP) and they operate their business in Texas.  They each put in capital contributions of $50,000.  Each of them is assigned a Territory (Dustin has territory south of Hillsboro and west of I-35.  Jean has all territory south of Hillsboro and east of I-35.  Michael has all territory north of Hillsboro, including DFW).  Michael meets with Sullivan Industries in Dallas and takes them on as a client to help them hire a CFO.  Michael personally does all the research and recommends Mr. Hoverson for the job.  Based on that recommendation, Sullivan hires Hoverson.  Hoverson later embezzles money from the company.  It turns out that Hoverson had been convicted of a similar crime at a previous company in Minnesota 9 years earlier.  Michael had not informed Sullivan of this fact and so this is a serious case of malpractice by Michael and costs Sullivan Industies (between the bad publicity and actual money lost) $1,000,000.   Sullivan Industries sues the DJM general partnership.  The GP has $100,000 available (The rest of the "capital" has been spent), Dustin has $50,000 of personal assets to his name, Jean has $600,000 and Michael has $10,000.   Assuming Sullivan wins the suit, how much can Sullivan collect from Jean's personal assets?

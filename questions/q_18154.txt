A country's trade in manufactured goods diminished substantially, causing it to lose tax revenue and become a net borrower of foreign funds. For the next two decades, its government used the borrowed funds to upgrade the nation's waste-water treatment plants and to develop efficient rapid transit systems, creating substantial gainful employment for its workforce. Thereafter, the country began to quickly repay its past borrowing debt. Which of the following most strongly supported this country's successful economic recovery?

Figure 3(a) gives a memory array with 10 words, and each word contains 4 bits. Apply background data 0: 0000 and 1: 1111 using MATS++ shown in Fig. 3(b), and discuss the detection (entering S for sensitization and O for observation to a table) for stuck-at, transition, inversion coupling faults. Use a table like the one shown in Fig. 3(c) to fill in S and O or undetectable for each fault. Assumptions: (a) The inversion coupling faults are couple-dominating (instead of write-dominating) for adjacent cells in the same word. That is, after the logic value of a victim cell has been written into the cell, the coupling effect takes place.  Further assume that an aggressor cell only affects its immediate adjacent cells. (b) The memory array contains one fault. This single fault assumption is to simplify the answers. That is, you do NOT need to consider the case where faults are correlated. For example, when you consider a single stuck-at fault at cell A, you do not need to consider a coupling fault that will attack cell A.

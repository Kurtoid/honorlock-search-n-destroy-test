First Free Response Question.  Work on your own paper while honorlock is running.  When you have finished type in your final answer.  Be sure to upload your written solution.  You must show all intermediate steps, list assumptions, draw appropriate figures, etc. to receive full credit. Consider a wing with a rectangular planform.  The wingspan is b = 11 m and the chord is c = 1.45 m.  The wing is composed of cambered airfoil sections with a constant lift slope of m0 = 6.5 per radian and a zero-lift angle of attach of -2 degrees.  The wing has twist with the geometric angle of attack equal to 5 degrees at the root (y = 0) and 1 degree at each wing tip (y = b/2 and y = -b/2). Use lifting line theory to estimate the wing coefficient of lift CL and induced drag CDi .  To simplify your analysis, only retain two terms in the Fourier expression and evaluate at y = 0 and y = b/4.

Data on fuel consumption for the 50 states plus Washington, D.C. were collected to develop a regression equation to predict fuel consumption based on population density. The variables collected were:  FUELCON = fuel consumption per capita;  POP  = state population; AREA = area of state in square miles;  DENSITY = population density (POP/AREA).  Analyze the SAS outputs provided to answer the question about the Model fuelcon= b0 + b1 density (R2 = 0.206 ).   ( T or F) The results suggest that fuel consumption does not require any transformation, whereas the variable density should be transformed by taking the natural log of density to achieve linearity and a higher R2.

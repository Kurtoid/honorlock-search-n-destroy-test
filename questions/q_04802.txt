Questions 1 to 10 refer to the following case: Mrs. A. is a 48 y. old paramedic. She has recently noticed a decrease in her exercise tolerance including being 'short of breath' even on what is described as normal exertion - for instance, climbing several flights of stairs. This has become progressively noticeable over the last 3 months. There is no pain associated with the breathlessness, although there is a cough, especially at night when lying down. She also has a feeling of lethargy, and has noticed that she feels cold most of the time. On examination she is found to be overweight (BMI = 29). Her skin is dry to the touch.   On auscultation of the chest, breath sounds are mostly vesicular with bilateral crepitations at the lung bases.   Question: If Mrs A. were diagnosed with a left sided pneumonia with consolidation at the left base, a description of bronchial breathing would be best defined by which one of the following?

In mice, black coat color (B) is dominant over brown (b) and a solid pattern (S) is dominant over white spotted (s). A spotted mouse with a black coat color is crossed with a homozygous brown, solid mouse.  All the F1 mice are black and solid.  A testcross is then carried out by mating the F1 mice with brown spotted mice. Using the five-step method on scratch paper, give the expected ratios of the progeny expected from the testcross. The predicted phenotypic ratio would be:  [blank1] black solid: [blank2] black spotted: [blank3]brown solid: [blank4] brown spotted  The predicted genotypic ratio would be: [blank5]BbSs:[blank6]Bbss:[blank7]bbSs:[blank8]bbss

Use information below to answer the next few questions. Assume that Alice, John, and Bob can communicate using either Symmetric Key Cryptography and/or Public Key Cryptography, with the following parameters:  Alice and Bob shared the secret key, Ks, with each other.  Only Bob and Alice knows the secret key, Ks. Alice has Bob's and John's public key in her keyring. Bob and John have Alice's public key in their keyrings. Alice's keypair is denoted with Ka- for private key and Ka+ for public key. Bob's keypair is denoted with Kb- for private key and Kb+ for public key. John's keypair is denoted with Kj- for private key and Kj+ for public key. m is the plaintext message. H(x) is the digest of "x" using cryptographic hash function, where "x" can be the plaintext message "m" or other values that goes through the cryptographic hash function. Assume that H(m) received is valid and has not been forged.  Below are the messages received by Alice from Bob.    Msg#  Msg#    1  Ka+(m) 6  m, Ka+( H(m) )    2 Kb+(m) 7  m, Kb+( H(m) )   3  m, H(m) 8  m, Kb- ( H(m) )   4  m, H(Ks + m) 9  Ka+( m, Kb- ( H(m) ) )   5  m, H(m) + Ks 10  Kb+ ( m, Ka+( H(m) ) )    You can use Worksheet D on the Midterm Exam Appendix to help you keep track of the property of each message.   Question When Bob sent message 5 to Alice, which type(s) of attacks will this message be vulnerable to?  Select all that apply.

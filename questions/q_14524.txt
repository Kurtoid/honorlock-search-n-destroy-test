Values are a critical component of culture. Ethics is the way those values are carried out in our behaviors, and are embodied as principles in our Student Code of Standards, and our Student Code of Academic Integrity. The Florida International University Student Code of Standards:A University is a learning community that follows a tradition of more than 1000 years. Florida International University is such a community dedicated to generating and transmitting knowledge through excellent teaching and research, the rigorous and respectful exchange of ideas, and community service. As a member of this community:  I will respect the tradition of academic inquiry, the University's rules of conduct, and its mission I will respect the opinions and differences of all members of the FIU community I will practice civility and avoid behavior that undermines the normal functioning of the University I will respect the rights and property of the University and its members I will be diligent and honest in my personal and academic endeavors  Student Code of Academic Integrity:Every student must respect the right of all to have an equitable opportunity to learn and honestly demonstrate the quality of their learning. Therefore, all students must adhere to a standard of academic conduct, demonstrating respect for themselves, their fellow students, and the educational mission of the University. As a student of this university:  I will not represent someone else's work as my own I will not cheat, nor will I aid in another's cheating I will be honest in my academic endeavors I understand that if I am found responsible for academic misconduct, I will be subject to the academic misconduct procedures and sanctions as outlined in the Student Handbook  By clicking 'I agree" you are acknowledging that you have read this statement, agree with and accept its content.

Please use the following information to answer the following questions.You work for a company selling tropical rain forest plants commonly found in the understory of the forest. These plants are shade tolerant and can be grown indoors because they require low light. Your employer wants you to find out what is the best type of light to maximize growth of these understory plants. Using a full spectrum of natural light would cause these plants to die because they are a shade-tolerant plant species.From your biology class, you recall that the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis involve pigment molecules that absorb light of specific wavelengths. You also remember the experiments done by the German biologist Theodor Engelmann, in which he separated light using a prism into different wavelengths and then determined which wavelengths were best for promoting photosynthesis in the algae species he was examining. Your goal is to determine which wavelengths (colors) of light are best for promoting photosynthesis to enhance growth in your species of plant. To achieve this, you grew your plants under different wavelengths of light and measured their growth rates. The wavelengths were measured in nanometers (nm), and the growth rate was measured in millimeters per day (mm/day). The data you collected are as follows:    Wavelengths Growth   400 nm 0.33 mm/day   450 nm 0.46 mm/day   500 nm 0.88 mm/day   550 nm 0.12 mm/day   600 nm 0.54 mm/day   650 nm 0.28 mm/day   700 nm 0.08 mm/day   750 nm 0.00 mm/day    Make a bar graph plotting growth rates on the y-axis and wavelengths of light on the x-axis. Referring to your graph, answer the following questions:Which of these wavelengths is LEAST useful to your plants?
Which of these cells secrete hormones?

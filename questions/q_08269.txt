Jill is a 16-year-old girl. Her parents brought her to therapy because they despaired for several years that her insistence that she was a boy. She wanted to dress in boy's attire and begin masculinizing hormone treatments. What they thought would be a passing whim, over the years, they now realize was a deeply set conviction. At approximately age 3, Jill began showing a greater interest in playing with the toys that her brother, older by 7 years, had used: cars, trucks, soldiers, swords and so on. She was uninterested in the girl-typical toys such as dolls, house items, and stuffed animals, which her parents kept buying for her. At age 4, she declared that she was a boy; any attempt of telling her otherwise was met by crying protests. In kindergarten, at age 5, Jill much preferred the company of boys with whom she would engage in competitive body-contact games. At girls' social gatherings she kept apart, choosing aloneness rather than joining in games and other activities. She would ask, "Where the other boys? Why am I the only one here?" For school she insisted on wearing boyish clothes, resisting more typically feminine ones. At around age 7, her favorite movies and TV shows involved some young male hero or boy-centered story with which she would identify. As Jill entered puberty, she found herself isolating more and more. She did not fit anywhere. Girls found her "strange," thus the avoidance was mutual, whereas boys tended to ignore her or tease her for being "weird." Jill felt it was a tragedy not to have a penis; she hated the emergence of her breasts, which she would flatten with cloth straps. Jill was sexually and emotionally attracted to girls and thought of herself as heterosexual. When her menarche occurred at age 14, she cried for days, experiencing then for the first time a 3-month-long depressive episode. Based on the information available, what is the most appropriate diagnosis, if any?
Should Louisiana eliminate the 12th grade and allow students to graduate after their junior year?Senior year has become the subject of an ongoing national debate. In June 2003, Florida passed legislation that permits students to graduate from high school with 18 credits instead of 24, effectively allowing students to graduate after their junior year. Subsequently, Colorado's legislature has proposed radical elimination of the 12th grade and the establishment of a year of preschool instead. At the heart of both states' attempted solutions is a fundamental question: What is senior year for? Compose an essay of approximately 500-750 words in which you argue at least two (2) reasons whether or not Louisiana should consider eliminating the 12th grade. This argument should be based on your own experience, knowledge you have gained from others, and at least TWO of the readings on the "Final Exam Quotations" Handout to support your opinion and/or to contrast their statements with your own ideas. The references may be direct quotations or paraphrases, and you must in-text cite your sources using MLA format within your essay to show which readings provided your information. No Works Cited Page is needed. Your essay must be your own composition, presenting your own ideas and not merely a patchwork of others' works and ideas. Your essay will be evaluated on your argument, and, in part, on how effectively the readings are used.

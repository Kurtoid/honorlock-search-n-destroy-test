Refer to Figure D, which gives the marginal cost of pollution clean-up for a four-firm economy. So for example, for Firm A to reduce pollution by the first unit would require it spends $50, for the second unit $100, the third $150, and for the fourth unit it would require $250 and that it had already reduced pollution by the first three units (spending $300 to clean up the first three units).  If the government sold pollution permits, how much should they sell them for to reduce pollution by 8 units? Hint: find the permit price required to clean up the cheapest 8 units.

Use the following scenario to answer the following questions:   A professor wants to perform an experiment to test which resources would be best for students to pass her exams. She is currently in the classroom and she sends half her class to study in the library and the other half must stay in the classroom. Both groups of students have access to any available resources within their location of study. To test which group of students does better, the students at the library return to the classroom and students play team Kahoot where each group competes to get the correct answer and the fastest. Points are awarded based on correct answers and speed of the correct answer. No points are rewarded for wrong answers. Professor Archer predicts the library students will score better on the kahoot than the students who stayed in the classroom. The actual experiment was performed: Team library: 8/10 42048 points Team classroom: 10/10  53073 points Note that the students in team classroom found and looked at the answers to the kahoot test, although team library was unaware. Professor Archer ruled that because the answer key was in the classroom it counted as any available resources in the classroom. Which of the following statements above is an example of the hypothesis being tested?

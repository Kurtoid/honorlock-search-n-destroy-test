A company wishes to deploy an FDD TDMA system with 100kHz carriers. There will be 5 timeslots (channels) per carrier and one channel on EACH CARRIER will be used for control. The company will deploy 3 sectored basestations. Each basestation will cover approximately 600 uniformly distributed users. Each user will make on average 2 calls per hour and each call will last 3 minutes on average.   What is the traffic intensity per user (Au) in Erlangs? How many users will be covered by one sector of one basestation and how many Erlangs will they draw? How many traffic channels will be required in each sector to support the traffic described in 2. above at a 0.01 GOS? How many carriers will be required per sector to supply the channels described in 3. above? How many carriers will each basestation require? The equipment's S/I limitations require 4 cell reuse (N=4) with 3 sectored sectoring. Based on 4, above, how many carriers will be required for this deployment? Assuming the carriers are packed next to each other without guard bands or extra spacing, and assuming you need carriers as computed in 5. above, how much spectrum (i.e. how many MHz of frequencies) will this deployment require for the downlink? How many MHz for the uplink and downlink together?

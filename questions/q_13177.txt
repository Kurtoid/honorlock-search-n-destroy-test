A building may fail by excessive settlement of the foundation or by collapse of the superstructure. Over the life of the building, the probability of excessive settlement of the foundation is estimated to be 0.1, whereas the probability of collapse of the superstructure is 0.05. Also, if there is excessive settlement of the foundation, the probability of superstructure collapse would increase to 0.2. Compute: a) The probability that both failure modes will occur over the life of the building. b) The probability that the building will fail during its lifetime, i.e., at least one mode of failure occurs. c) The probability that only one of the two failure modes will occur over the life of the building.

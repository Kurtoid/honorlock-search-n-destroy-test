Lithium metal and nitrogen gas react according to a combination (synthesis) reaction, shown below, to produce lithium nitride (Li3N).  6 Li (s) + 3 N2 (g) --> 2 Li3N (s) In a particular experiment, [x] g of lithium were combined  with 15.00 g of nitrogen and reacted.  Calculate the theoretical yield of lithium nitride. You must  identify the limiting reactant. Report your answer to 4 significant figures.  Do not include units.

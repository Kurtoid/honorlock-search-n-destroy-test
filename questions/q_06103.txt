At a given point in a capillary, the blood hydrostatic pressure is 13mmHg, while the interstitial hydrostatic pressure is 0mmHg. At the same point in the capillary, the blood colloid osmotic pressure is 28mmHg. The interstitial colloid osmotic pressure is 4mmHg. 1. At this point in the capillary bed, the net hydrostatic pressure is [fill1] and favors movement of fluid [fill2] the capillary? 2. Considering both net hydrostatic pressure and net colloid osmotic pressure, you determine that [fill3] is occurring and at a net pressure of [fill4]. 3. This point in the capillary bed is likely closer to the [fill5] end of the capillary bed.

For questions 9-12 apply your knowledge of feedback loops to this example: It is very important to regulate blood solute concentration (osmolarity) by conserving or eliminating water.  When blood solute concentration (osmolarity) increases, chemoreceptors of the hypothalamus detect this change.  The hypothalamus triggers the release of anti-diuretic hormone.  Anti-diuretic hormone travels through the blood and binds to receptors on kidney cells.  The kidney cells conserve more water (preventing water loss in the urine).  As a result, blood solute concentration (osmolarity) decreases.

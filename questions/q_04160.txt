Section 1. The Four Quadrant Model (4QM).   In the problem, you are asked to explain the relationships depicted in the Four Quadrant Model (4QM) and predict changes in rents, prices, stock of space, and construction due to the shock using the model. It would be helpful for you to draw the 4QM before and after the shock to answer the questions. But you do not need to submit the drawings.   1. [8 points] Explain the relationship between the variables in each of the four quadrants: (i) What does the relationship in the quadrant stand for? (ii) How do variables depend on each other according to this relationship?  Quadrant I Quadrant II Quadrant III Quadrant IV    2. [4 points] Consider a more strict zoning regulations. Will this more strict zoning regulations affect any of the relationships depicted in the quadrants? If yes, explain how.   3. [12 points] How does the equilibrium change due to this more strict zoning regulations? To answer the questions below, it is helpful to draw the old and new equilibrium before and after the change in zoning regulations. You do not need to submit the drawing with the midterm, only use it to answer the questions below. (a) [4 points] Compare the rents, prices, stock of space, and construction in the new equilibrium relative to the old equilibrium.

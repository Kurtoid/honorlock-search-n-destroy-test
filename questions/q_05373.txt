Pick another of the following five prompts, clearly indicate which prompt was selected, and answer completely in the space provided below. 1) The Gene: An Intimate History argues that the three "R's" of gene physiology (regulation, replication, and recombination) are dependent on the molecular structure of DNA - specifically, on its base-pairing of the two complementary strands. Explain how regulation, replication, and recombination depend on this base-pairing principle/characteristic of DNA. 2) From The Gene: An Intimate History: "Gene, protein, function, and fate were strung in a chain: one chemical alteration in one base pair in DNA was sufficient to 'encode' a radical change in human fate." Give a specific example of this "chain" in humans, explaining the change in DNA, the following change in protein, the resulting change in function, and the corresponding "fate" of the human organism. (You may use the example from the book or choose your own example.) 3) Genetic diversity within a population's gene pool provides an evolutionary advantage. Sexual reproduction allows for increase in genetic variation because meiosis (the process of creating gametes for sexual reproduction) produces new combinations of alleles in two major ways. Define these two ways of generating genetic variation through meiosis, and explain how each can increase genetic diversity. 4) Explain how Francis Galton's strategy of eugenics paved the way for Nazi racial cleansing. Using what you read in The Gene: An Intimate History, define the term "eugenics" from Galton's perspective and describe at least two examples of eugenic practices encouraged or implemented in America. Then briefly explain how the Nazis twisted the language of heredity to justify their cause and how they incrementally expanded their eugenics program of sterilization, euthanasia, and outright murder to eventually include all lebensunwertes Leben - lives unworthy of living. 5) Based on what you read in The Gene: An Intimate History, explain why scientists originally expected proteins to be the molecules that carry genes rather than nucleic acids (the "stupid molecule"). Then, explain the significance of James Watson's revelation that "important biological objects come in pairs": to what "pairing" does this revelation refer; how did Watson come to this conclusion; and how did this realization, combined with Chargaff's rule, solve the previously frustrating mystery of the structure of DNA?

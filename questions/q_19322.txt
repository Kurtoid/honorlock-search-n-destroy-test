Physician Office Record Office Notes: Mr. Hafner is a 51-year-old white male who has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He had esophageal dilatation for a Schatzki's ring since the last time he was here in April because of swallowing difficulties. He claims that since then he has had no problems with his swallowing and even his heartburn has improved a lot. He denies any chest pains or any shortness of breath. He is still taking Prilosec for symptoms of reflux. The patient is on lovastatin for hyperlipidemia. He is severely overweight, but he is not motivated to lose weight. He is not working and yet he does not do any kind of exercise. Physical exam shows a well-developed, very obese male who does not appear to be in any distress. He is nonchalant about his problems and what he is more interested in is symptomatic relief of his symptoms rather than his hypertension or risk of cardiovascular disease. His vital signs today show a blood pressure of 132/84, heart rate is 110 bpm, weight is 231.5 pounds which is one and one half pounds more than what he weighed last time. He has no pallor, no jaundice. Neck shows no jugular venous distention. Heart is regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Extremities show no edema. Assessment: Blood pressure is normal. I changed his anti-hypertensive from hydrochlorothiazide to atenolol for better control of his blood pressure.  His last cholesterol profile was done in October when he had an LDL of 130, HDL of 40 and triglycerides of 213. He is on lovastatin for hyperlipidemia for which I will continue the dose of 20 mg daily. In term of his severe obesity, the patient is unmotivated, but I advised him on exercises that he can do and a more healthful diet consisting of mostly vegetables and salads.  I will continue the Prilosec since it offers symptomatic relief of his reflux. His next visit will be in four months.

(For all students) The small cylindrical mass m is confined to slide on the slender rod of length L and mass m0 which is free to rotate in the vertical plane about O. The spring which supports the mass has a stiffness k, and r = r0 when it is uncompressed. Neglecting friction and the mass of the spring,  What is the kinetic energy of the cylindrical mass? What is the kinetic energy of the slender rod? What is the potential energy of the cylindrical mass? What is the potential energy of the slender rod? What is the potential energy of the spring? What is the Lagrangian for the system? What is the r equation of motion?

Please use the following information to answer the question(s) below.The Brazil nut tree, Bertholletia excels (n = 17), is native to tropical rain forests of South America. It is a hardwood tree that can grow to over 50 meters tall, is a source of high-quality lumber, and is a favorite nesting site for harpy eagles. As the rainy season ends, tough-walled fruits, each containing 8-25 seeds (Brazil nuts), fall to the forest floor. Brazil nuts are composed primarily of endosperm. About $50 million worth of nuts are harvested each year. Scientists have discovered that the pale yellow flowers of Brazil nut trees cannot fertilize themselves and admit only female orchid bees as pollinators. The agouti (Dasyprocta spp.), a cat-sized rodent, is the only animal with teeth strong enough to crack the hard wall of Brazil nut fruits. It typically eats some of the seeds, buries others, and leaves still others inside the fruit, which moisture can then enter. The uneaten seeds may subsequently germinate.Orchid bees are to Brazil nut trees as ________ are to pine trees.

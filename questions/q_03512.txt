Be sure to write equations and show all work. A plumber pushes a 30 kg crate of parts across a horizontal floor with a constant horizontal force, F, directed to the right.  The crate moves 2.5 m to the right, accelerating from 2.0 m/s to a final velocity of 6.0 m/s.  A frictional force between the crate and the floor points to the left, opposite the motion. a)  Use the work and energy equation to find the total work done by all non-conservative forces together. b)  Given the frictional force between the crate and the floor is fk = 45 N, find the work done by the plumber (by force F) to the box.
Thomas Jefferson said that the idea of a democracy was that each individual had equal say in how the country ought to operate and the only way it was going to work was if each individual took responsibility upon himself to stay educated and informed about our society.  Otherwise we would end up again in an olicharchy where only a wealthy powerful few actually control things.

Above is the multiple regression analysis that predicts life expectancy (in years) based on the year a person was born, their gender (M=0 F=1) and their race (White=0, Black=1).  On the graph above, the legend shows the different groups with circles (race=0, gender=0), squares (race=0, gender=1), diamonds (race=1, gender=0) and triangles (race=1, gender=1).  They represent respectively: [groups]   What is the baseline group in this model? [baseline]   According to the ANOVA p-value, how many of the predictor variables in the model are good? [Anova]   Which of the predictors should be eliminated from this model in order to make it better? [eliminate]

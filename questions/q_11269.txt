Right before killing his wife, the husband called his divorce lawyer and asked to meet with him for advice. They met in a booth at a local bar. The bar was empty except for the bartender. The husband appeared upset, and the lawyer tried to calm him down. The husband, in a whisper, told the lawyer that his wife confused and angered him, and that he had just bought a handgun. The lawyer advised the husband to seek psychiatric help and not to do anything with the gun. The husband returned home and shot his wife.   After the husband was taken into custody, he called the lawyer and said, "You're fired. You didn't help me before and you sure can't help me now." The prosecutor subpoenaed the lawyer to testify at the husband's homicide trial, based upon the bartender's statement that she had seen, but not heard, the two speaking in a booth, and asked what the husband had said about his wife at the bar.  What should the lawyer do?

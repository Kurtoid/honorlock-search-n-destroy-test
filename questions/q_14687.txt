In this image, DAT stands for dopamine active transporter.  If the presynaptic neuron in this image were not producing enough dopamine, a drug might be given that targets the DAT protein.  Would this drug act to stimulate or inhibit the DAT protein?   inhibit The DAT protein recycles dopamine back into the preganglionic cell--removing it from the synaptic cleft.  If the presynaptic cell were not making enough, you would want any dopamine that WAS being made to be left in the synaptic cleft for longer...helping to ensure it was have a proper physiologic response.

Let the continuous random variable, X,  denote the diameter of a hole drilled in a sheet metal component. The target diameter is 12.5 mm.  Most random disturbances to the process result in larger diameters. Historical data show that the distribution of X can be modeled by a probability density function f(x) = 20e-20(x - 12.5)  for x > 12.5 mm. This copywritten question is part of a quiz or exam at Arizona State.  It may not be posted or reproduced without the permission of the author, Dr. L. Chattin, and Arizona State University.   What is the probability that a hole diameter is equal to 12.6 mm?

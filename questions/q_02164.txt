9. A fiber has attenuation of 0.00004 dB/m. What is the total attenuation of a 100 km length?                                         10. a) If 0.73 uW of light is measured at the end of a fiber optic (58 km) with an attenuation of 0.021 dB/km, how much light was sent initially? b) What is the equivalent signal in dBm and dBu?                                         11. Determine the length of an instantaneous pulse sent through a 50 km multimode fiber with a total dispersion of 3.75 ns/km.                                         12. You lose 0.5 dB coupling a 1067 nW HeNe laser into a multimode optical fiber. Another 0.15 dB loss occurs at the receiving end. Determine the length of the fiber, knowing that the output signal is 0.49 uW. (Attenuation is 0.01 dB/km)                                       13. a) Determine the total chromatic dispersion for a fiber with a waveguide dispersion of 7.5 ps/nm-km and a material dispersion of 16 ps/nm-km. b) This fiber is used in a communication system for transmitting 125 ps pulses by using as a source a HeNe laser (632.8 nm) with a spectral width of 0.015 nm. Determine the width of the output pulse knowing that the fiber length is 75 km.                                       14. In an optical communication system, the optical source provides a signal with 6.5 mW power. At the receiving end there is a loss of 2.75 dB due to a bad connector. The coupling connection of the source induces a 1.09 dB loss into the system. Two repeaters (0.99 dB each) are added to the system. The fiber length has an attenuation of 0.04 dB/km. Determine the length of the fiber required to transmit a 1.2 mW signal.                                       15. An instant pulse is sent through a step index multimode fiber with a length of 50 km. The fiber has a characteristic dispersion of 9.5 ns/1000m. Determine: a) The modal dispersion of the fiber. b) The data rate (Data rate = 0.7/pulse spreading).                                         16. A laser source (0.05 nm bandwidth) is connected to a fiber that transmits a single mode at 1300 nm. The fiber chromatic dispersion is 65 ps/nm-km. Determine: a) The maximum data rate that fiber could transmit 120 km. b) An optical amplifier (repeater) is needed after every 24 dB of fiber loss. If the fiber attenuation is 1.2 dB/km, how many repeaters are required to transmit the signal?

Assume a closed economy, with no government, is characterized by the following production function:     Y = 4(K1/3)(L2/3) The savings rate in this economy is s = .40, the rate at which capital depreciates is  = .04, and the growth rate of the population n = .06 (there's no technological growth so g = 0). a) Calculate the steady-state level of capital per actual worker (k*), output per actual worker (y*), consumption per actual worker (c*), and investment per worker (i*). If the current population is equal to L = 20, calculate aggregate output (Y) and the capital stock (K) assuming that we are at the steady-state. b)  What is the golden savings rate (s'golden) and k*golden? If the savings rate were to increase from s=.40 to s=.50, how would this affect y, c, and i initially and would those variables be higher or lower at the new steady-state compared to the steady-state in (a)?

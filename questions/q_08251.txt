You are going to construct a 95% confidence interval for the parameter.   a. What is symbol and value of the parameter? [parameter]   b. Which of the following are the necessary assumptions for a 95% confidence interval for comparing two independent proportions?  Quantitative data in both groups Categorical data in both groups Independent random samples The sample sizes n1 = 1149 and n2 = 1059 are both at least 30 Successes and failures in group 1 and group 2 are 544, 605, 573, 486 respectively and are all at least 15.  For credit, you must choose all of the assumptions that apply. [assump]   c. The 95% confidence interval is (-0.11, -0.03).  Complete the interpretation.

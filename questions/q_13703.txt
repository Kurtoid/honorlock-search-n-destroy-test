The food stamp program provides low income households with coupons which can be exchanged for some specified dollar value worth of food.  Many economists argue that this program is an inefficient means of increasing the well being of low income families. Proponents of this view argue that an equivalent cash subsidy would bring about a greater increase in the well being of the low income families receiving aid.

Critically evaluate the pros and cons of the food stamp program. Do food stamps ensure that low income families increase their consumption of food?

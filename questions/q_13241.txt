Single-Select Questions with Reading Passage #1 GroceryGrabbr The following passage will be used to answer questions #1 - #5Markus is finding that it takes too long to track down all of the groceries he needs to buy from a given store. GroceryGrabbr to the rescue! The app allows Markus to input his shopping list and search for his local grocery store in GroceryGrabbr's database. If his grocery store is there, Markus is all set to go! The database stores grocery items, cost, and item location information for each grocery store. When Markus walks into the store, a notification pops up on his smartphone letting him know that GroceryGrabbr is ready to get to work. Each of Markus' grocery items is displayed one at a time, along with the aisle number and shelf location. After Markus grabs his items off the shelf, he hits a button on the app to navigate to the next item. The list of items is arranged so that Markus follows the most efficient path through the grocery store. When Markus finishes shopping, the total amount of money his groceries cost is displayed, which allows him to double check the total cost with the cashier. GroceryGrabbr pays grocery stores a small amount of money for each user who successfully uses the app and checks out of the store with over one hundred dollars worth of groceries.

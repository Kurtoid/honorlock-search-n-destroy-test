A scientist studying fly development isolates two proteins encoded by the same gene that differ from each other by the length of the C-terminal domain. The protein isolated from the head region is identical to the one from the thorax in the N-terminal region but is shorter by 30 amino acids.   Analysis of gene sequence indicates a presence of a single ORF that would lead to the production of the longer peptide, the one produced in the thorax.   What is the most likely mechanism responsible for the production of the two different peptides encoded by this gene? Hint: draw a picture.

Enter the pitches for an ascending F-sharp harmonic minor scale. Use letter names, where "#" is a sharp, "b" is a flat, "x" is a double sharp, "bb" is a double flat. So G-flat would be entered "Gb" (no spaces between). A note with a "natural" is just the letter name, so D natural = "D" Do - re - me (etc) Ascending:  F# - [re] - [mi] - [fa] - [sol] - [la] - [ti] - F#

On the "Exam1-Q5" tab is data showing the depth of a stream as a function of distance (x) from the left bank. Write a VBA code to read in the data, calculate the cross-sectional area of each segment (segment 1 extends from x = 0 to x =3, segment 2 extends from x = 3 to x = 6, etc.) and the total cross-sectional area of the stream using the trapezoid rule. Note: if you cannot get your code to work, you may work this problem using spreadsheet formulas for partial credit but clearly note on the spreadsheet if you're choosing the formula option. The code/formulas should be written such that values in blue change correctly if the values in yellow change and the code is re-executed. Once complete, please type a one-word essay (e.g., "ok") for this question and then upload your combined Excel file at the very end of this exam.

Intokozo jikelele kayisekho lapha ekhaya. Amashwa lapha ekhaya ayatetana. Selokhu aqala mhla uMthoko ebuya ekhaya ebathazela ngezinyawo, eshawayizela ngesikhinjana esincane sangaphansi. Izicathulo Kanye nebhantshi kungasekho. Wathi uma ebuzisiswa ukuthi izingubo zishonephi wathi akazi. Okukodwa akukhumbulayo yizithunzana ezimnyama ezisabantu athi wazibona evela esikoleni.     2   Zazimhleka ulimi, zimzungezela osengathi zifuna ukumbamba. Wagcina ekhala ememeza okwembuzi ihlatshwa. Uthi emva kwalokho akakhumbuli lothu olwenzeka. Uhlutshulwa izingubo nje uMthoko, emasontweni amabili adlule, Balahlekelwe yimali ebhekile lapha ekhaya. Babhudula umuzi wonke, lutho imali.

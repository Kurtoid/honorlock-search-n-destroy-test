For all parts (a) to (d), please write each answer as the strategy pair (Maersk price, CMA/MSC price). For instance, if Maersk sets price at 1080 and CMA/MSC at 1120 (so that Maersk profit 836 and CMA/MSC profit is 736), you should write your answer as (1080, 1120). No credit will be given if you do not write the answers using this convention. As in class, the payoff for Maersk is the bold number, and CMA/MSC payoff is the lighter number. (a) What is the (simultaneous) Nash Equilibrium of this game? (3 pts) (b) What do the two firms choose as strategies if: Maersk goes first and commits to its best strategy, assuming CMA/MSC responds with its best strategy? (3 pts) (c) What do the two firms choose as strategies if: CMA/MSC goes first and commits to its best strategy, assuming Maersk responds with its best strategy? (3 pts) (d) What is collusive outcome that maximizes the sum of the payoffs to the two players? (3 pts)

In early 2009 Apple Inc.'s management was considering making an offer to buy Banana Corporation. Banana's projected operating income (EBIT) for 2009 was $32 million, but Apple believes that if the two firms were merged, it could consolidate some operations, reduce Banana's expenses, and raise its EBIT to $45 million.  Neither company uses any debt, and they both pay income taxes at a 35% rate.  Apple has a better reputation among investors, who regard it as better managed and also less risky, so Apple 's stock has a P/E ratio of 16 versus a P/E of 13 for Banana.  Since Apple 's management will be running the entire enterprise after a merger, investors will value the resulting corporation based on Apple's P/E.  Based on expected market values, how much synergy should the merger create?

While on your trip to the Antarctic, you are part of a team who discovers the femur (leg bone) of a nomadic woman.  Forensics use the formula Ht = 61.412 + 2.317f where f is the length of the femur in centimeters and the height is then given in centimeters.  The femur measures to be 21 cm.  Estimate the height of the woman.  Do NOT report the "cm" in your answer.  Only report the number accurate to three decimal places. You may use your calculator for this problem.

The body maintains this "normal" range by using a (a. POSITIVE or NEGATIVE) feedback loop to reverse the direction of change and make small adjustments.  For example, when blood calcium levels are high, the hormone (b. CALCITONIN or PARATHYROID HORMONE) is secreted from the (c. THYROID or PARATHYROID) gland.  This hormone stimulates cells called (d. OSTEOBLASTS or OSTEOCLASTS) to begin storing the excess blood calcium into the bone matrix.  Working opposite to these cells and the previous hormone is another hormone called (e. CALCITONIN or PARATHYROID HORMONE) which is secreted from the (f. THYROID or PARATHYROID) gland.

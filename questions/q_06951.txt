Midterm -   EGR/CSC1054 100 points total - You must complete this without talking or chatting or emailing or asking for help from other people. You may use any other resource you would like. Remember to turn in your work on canvas at the end of the lab time. You can assume you will get "valid" input in all parts of the program. Part I:  Create program that keeps track of a list of first names. Start the list with "Josue", "Leslie", "Brenden", "Leslie", and "Steven". Loop over a menu and implement the functionality of the following options.  You should be able to remove a name (only remove one copy of the name). Print out the number of letters in each name and the names.    See below for a sample run and examples of how each command works.    Sample output: What do you wish to do?1.Remove one copy of a name2.Print out the number of letters in a name3.quit >> 25 Josue6 Leslie7 Brenden6 Leslie6 StevenWhat do you wish to do?1.Remove one copy of a name2.Print out the number of letters in a name3.quit >> 1What name would you like to remove? >> StevenWhat do you wish to do?1.Remove one copy of a name2.Print out the number of letters in a name3.quit>> 25 Josue6 Leslie7 Brenden6 LeslieWhat do you wish to do?1.Remove one copy of a name2.Print out the number of letters in a name3.quit >> 1What name would you like to remove? >> LeslieWhat do you wish to do?1.Remove one copy of a name2.Print out the number of letters in a name3.quit >> 25 Josue7 Brenden6 LeslieWhat do you wish to do?1.Remove one copy of a name2.Print out the number of letters in a name3.quit >> 3 Part 2: Part 2 uses this Moon class and the later client class. You may not modify moon or duplicate variables that already exist in Moon. You may not modify the client class. public class Moon{   private String name;   private boolean isGas;   private double diameter;   public Moon(String name, boolean isGas, double diameter)   {      this.name = name;      this.isGas = isGas;      this.diameter = diameter;   }      public String getName()   {      return name;   }   public boolean getIfGas()   {      return isGas;   }   public double getDiameter()   {      return diameter;   }}    Create a Planet class, which extends Moon Moon has the following methods: (see the use of each of these methods in the client and output).  Planet has a population amount. Planet should have an equals method which returns true if all the parts of each Planet/Moon are the same and false otherwise. Planet should have a method that determines if the population is endangered (a population is endangered if less than 500). Planet should have a toString method that prints out the following:  If gas:  is a ball of Gas with  people. If not gas: is a normal planet with a population of  people and a diameter of .      *In between the , please have the correct value for the particular instance.  Planet can have any accessors and mutators that it needs.    Client: public class PlanetClient{   public static void main(String[] args)   {      Planet earth = new Planet("Earth",false,5.5,499);      Planet psyclo = new Planet("Psychlo",true,100,0);      Moon phobia = new Planet("Phobia",false,5,0);            Planet mars = new Planet("Mars",true,100,10000);            if(earth.isPopulationEndangered())      {         System.out.println(""Humans," said Terl, "are an endangered species".");      }      if(mars.isPopulationEndangered())      {         System.out.println(""Martians," said Terl, "are an endangered species".");      }      System.out.println("Population of Psychlo is:" + psyclo.getPopulation());            System.out.println(earth);      System.out.println(psyclo);      System.out.println(phobia);            Planet earth2 = new Planet("Earth2",false,5.5,499);      System.out.println(earth.equals(earth2));            Planet psyclo2 = new Planet("Psychlo",true,100,1);      System.out.println(psyclo.equals(psyclo2));            Planet earth3 = new Planet("Earth",false,5.5,499);      System.out.println(earth.equals(earth3));            earth.setPopulation(1000);      System.out.println(earth);         }} output: "Humans," said Terl, "are an endangered species."Population of Psychlo is:0Earth is a normal planet with a population of 499 people and a diameter of 5.5Psychlo is a ball of Gas with 0 peoplePhobia is a normal planet with a population of 0 people and a diameter of 5.0falsefalsetrueEarth is a normal planet with a population of 1000 people and a diameter of 5.5     Part 3: Create a program to read in from a file called "midfile.txt". The file contains a whole number (let's call this number N) followed by N whole numbers. Determine if the numbers are sorted in an ascending order (smallest to biggest). Print out whether it is in order or not in order. Example file: 51 2 3 4 1   Output: Not in order

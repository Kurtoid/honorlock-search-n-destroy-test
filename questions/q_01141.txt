Case: Dr. Z., a professor of clinical psychology, after IRB approval, he ran an ad in the school newspaper seeking as paid subjects students who often felt depressed. After an extensive assessment battery and interview (for which all students were paid), 100 students were invited to sign up for a lengthy study that "monitored depressive feelings." Dr. Z was working on a hypothesis that a combination of regular physical activity and cognitive therapy would decrease the frequency of depressive feelings. The study, was double-blinded and contained the following groups   a control group; a group engaging in physical activity; a group receiving cognitive therapy; and a group both engaging in physical activity and receiving cognitive therapy.  Each student signed a consent form committing the student to two months of three half-hour sessions per week plus a follow-up . Each student would receive $10/hr for participation. Half of the money would be received at the end of the two months; the other half would be received after the six-month follow-up. Control group members simply met and talked about their feelings. Over the course of several weeks, one of the students in the control group became increasingly more depressed and unhappy, and eventually stopped showing up, and withdrew from school. She subsequently filed a grievance with the university arguing that she had signed up for the experiment  with hope that it would help her, but that instead it had harmed her. A second student in the control group, after talking with a psychology graduate student, discovered that he was not receiving the treatment that was hypothesized to be most effective and demanded that he be given that treatment immediately. The investigator refused, and this student also filed a grievance insisting that his rights were being abrogated and his mental health endangered . A third student argued that she should be released from the study because it wasn't helping her and, further, that she had been coerced into participating in the experiment by a lack of money and the unrealized hope of getting better. She argued that she should be paid for her time to date because she had been paid in previous psychology experiments in which she had declined to continue when given the opportunity either to stop or continue. How would you evaluate these students' claims?  Do you think the professor violated any principles of human research testing?  If each student's claim is allowed, what would that do to the study? Do you think the design is justified?

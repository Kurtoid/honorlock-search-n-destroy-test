After the narrator learns that Bartleby has been living in his office, he considers his employee's case: "My first emotions had been those of pure melancholy and sincerest pity; but just in proportion as the forlornness of Bartleby grew and grew in my imagination, did that same melancholy merge into fear, that fear into repulsion" (p. 1482).  What is it about Bartleby's situation that the narrator finds pitiable, fearful and revolting? Why does the narrator, a man far more socially acceptable to society, react the way he does towards Bartleby?
On January 1, 2021, Excalibur Company signed a contract agreeing to lease equipment from Merlin Corp.  The following information pertains to this lease:  The term of the noncancelable lease is 3 years, with no renewal option.  The equipment reverts to the lessor at the termination of the lease. Equal rental payments are due on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2021. Merlin manufactured the equipment at a cost of $90,000.  The fair value of the equipment on January 1, 2021 is $115,300.  The equipment has an economic life of 3 years with an unguaranteed residual value of $5,000.  Both parties use straight-line depreciation. Merlin sets the annual rental to ensure an 8% rate of return.  Excalibur's incremental borrowing rate is 10% and Excalibur does not know Merlin's implicit rate of return. Collectibility of lease payments is reasonably predictable.  Round all dollar amounts to the nearest dollar. Required:  Answer the following questions based on the information above.  In your response, be sure to specify which question you are answering by numbering your responses (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).  Calculate the amount of the annual rental payment.  Be sure to clearly designate your final answer. Insert a table (use the formatting below as a guide) in the field below to prepare the necessary journal entries made by Merlin with regard to the information above for 2021.  Be sure to label or date your journal entries. Insert a table (use the formatting below as a guide) in the field below to prepare the necessary journal entries made by Excalibur with regard to the information above for 2021.  Be sure to label or date your journal entries.  Assume that at the end of the lease term, the actual residual value is $4,000.  Insert a table (use the formatting below as a guide) in the field below to prepare the necessary journal entry made by the lessor at the end of the lease term to record the receipt of the equipment from the lessee.  Assume instead that the residual value of $5,000 was guaranteed by the lessee and that the expected residual value at the commencement of the lease was $2,000.  Under this alternate scenario, what amount would be capitalized by the lessee as the right-of-use asset and associated lease liability?

DQ3: At the end of her 12-hour shift, the nurse needs to document the fluid intake and output for her patient. The patient is NPO. The patient is receiving NS at 100 mL/hr, in addition to a IVPB 50 mL bag of metronidazole (Flagyl). The patient urinated 500 cc after breakfast, 300 cc after lunch and 300 cc after dinner. The nurse drained 100mL out of her JP drain 6 hours into her shift. Calculate the input (in mL) for this patient: _______ mL

Case study: Japanese four-o'clock flowers. In these plants, the allele for red flower has incomplete dominance. This is very convenient for this experiment because you can distinguish the heterozygous (CRCW pink flowers) from the homozygous dominant (CRCR red flowers).  In a population of Japanese four-o'clock plants, you find these phenotypes: 36% (CRCR) red, 48% (CRCW) pink and 16% (CWCW) white flowers. What is the frequency of the red allele (CR)?

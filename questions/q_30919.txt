In a recent case involving application of the search incident to arrest exception to cell phones, the Supreme Court ruled that:
As a biomedical engineer you are developing a reactor assembly, which produces alcohol for hand sanitizers. The initial system operates under steady-state conditions and it produces alcohol (ethanol, C2H5OH) from glucose (C6H12O6) according to the following reaction: C6H12O6 -  2 C2H5OH + 2 CO2 A diagram of this assembly is depicted below:       In order to increase the efficiency of this system you decide to make the following modifications (reactor assembly 2):  Some of the glucose from the exit stream is isolated through a crystallization process and mixed with the fresh feed of 2.0 kg before it enters the reactor. The gross feed, i.e. the total mass of glucose, which is fed directly into the reactor-subunit, is 19.0 kg. The single pass conversion of this subunit is the same as the conversion of glucose in reactor assembly 1.   a) Calculate the % increase of the overall conversion of glucose, which is achieved through the modification from reactor assembly 1 to assembly 2.  b) Calculate the mass-fractions of ethanol and in the product stream of reactor assembly 2. Calculations must be supported by a degree of freedom analysis.

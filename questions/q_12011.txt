2 pages Lack of pointer alias knowledge at static (compile) time can cause heavy imprecision in dataflow analysis. So we would like to find out points-to-sets. Points-to(p) defines the set of variables pointer p may be pointing to at a given program point. Points-to sets are to be found at the entry and exit of each basic block. Aliases are language dependent based on permissible operations. In our language a pointer can only point to a variable, not to another pointer. Assume that the underlying language has the following constructs : p = &a (address of object a is assigned to pointer p, note that a is not a pointer), p = q (pointer copy), p = b[i] and b[i] = p (a is an array of pointers, and p is set to a pointer contained at b[i] or vice-versa). Note that these are the only pointer operations supported in the language.     (I) Show through a small example using CFG how points-to() sets can be found for the underlying pointers at the basic block boundaries - just show the relevant pointer operations, data objects and nothing else.     (II) Formulate the problem as a data-flow problem and write the equations to solve the points-to() at the entry and exit of basic blocks.     (III) Write an algorithm based on (II) and show how it works on parts of the example in (I).
Case Study #3--Josh Campbell Josh is a 27 year-old male who recently moved back in with his parents after his fiance was killed by a drunk driver 3 months ago. His fiancee, a beautiful young woman he'd been dating for the past 4 years, was walking across a busy intersection to meet him for lunch one day. He still vividly remembers the horrific scene as the drunk driver ran the red light, plowing down his fiancee right before his eyes. He raced to her side, embracing her crumpled, bloody body as she died in his arms in the middle of the crosswalk. No matter how hard he tries to forget, sometimes he feels as though he is reliving the entire incident. Since the accident, Josh has been plagued with nightmares about the accident almost every night. He quit his job because his office was located in the building right next to the little cafe where he was meeting his fiancee for lunch the day she died. The few times he attempted to return to work were unbearable for him. He has since avoided that entire area of town. Normally an outgoing, fun-loving guy, Josh has become increasingly withdrawn, "jumpy", irritable and angry since his fiance's death. He's stopped working out, playing his guitar, or playing basketball with his friends - all activities he once really enjoyed. His parents worry about how detached and emotionally flat he's become. What is Josh's most likely diagnosis?
The linea aspera is located on the distal end of the femur.

1.30     A method used to investigate the rate of reaction of calcium carbonate with dilute hydrochloric acid under different conditions is shown.   * Place 50 cm3 of dilute hydrochloric acid in a conical flask. * Add a known volume of water to the conical flask. * Heat the conical flask to the required temperature. * Add 1.0 g of calcium carbonate to the conical flask. * Measure the time taken for the reaction to finish.   Which volume of water and which temperature gives the shortest time taken for the reaction to finish?           volume of water added / cm3   temperature / degC     A   10   30     B   10   50     C   40   30     D   40   50

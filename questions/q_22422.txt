Balance the redox reactions below:      a)  Fe3+ (aq) + Hg22+ (aq) - Fe2+ (aq) + Hg2+ (aq) b)  VO2+ (aq) + Sn2+ (aq) - V3+ (aq) + Sn4+ (aq)
The context of this question are the instructions and details provided above in the "Hands-on-Testing" text.  Generate (i.e. write down), using the Test Case Generation tool  and the model above as input, two different test cases.  Each test case should test that the system handles very expensive products and will trigger the defect described in the next question.  A test case is again a numbered listing of actions and asserts (see sample above ).  Note: Each test case needs only be long enough to detect the defect described in the question below.  For each test case, clearly mark where the test case will fail.
Match the people with their descriptions.

A manual platelet count is performed using a standard hemocytometer. A dilution was prepared by adding 20 microliters of blood to 1.98 mL of diluent.  116 and 120 platelets were counted on each respective side of the hemocytometer, within the 25 small squares of the large center square. The large center square measures 1mm x 1 mm on each side of a standard hemocytometer and the depth = 0.1 mm.  Calculate the total platelet count.

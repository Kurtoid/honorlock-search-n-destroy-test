Sentenced to the Newspaper Judges in several states are now permitted to sentence men who solicit prostitutes to buy ads in local newspapers to run their photos and the charges against them as a form of humiliation and shame. In some places, the names of the men can be placed on Web sites or even on a billboard. *  Is such a sentence for soliciting prostitutes morally permissible?     OR   CSI: Effect on Offenders? The proportion of rape cases that go unsolved is increasing, and some believe it is the result of television portrayals. Although the rate of cases solved by arrest rate for violent crimes overall has remained about the same (45 percent), the rate of rapes solved by police has dropped by about 10 percent in the last decade (from 51 to 41 percent). Some observers have speculated that this drop in the clearance rate might be due to more sophisticated offenders who are leaving less evidence at the scene. They argue that television shows like CSI: are informing offenders about the power of DNA evidence and that offenders are making victims shower or bathe and taking other measures to reduce evidence left at the scene. Other observers are not convinced that this change in the behavior of offenders is actually taking place, and note the general decline in the total number of rapes over the last decade, even though unsolved cases are growing.24  If it were to be proven that television shows like CSI: help criminals avoid apprehension, is it morally permissible to prohibit them?

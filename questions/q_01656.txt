Please mark this problem as EC.  I. A diver running at 1.80 m/s dives out horizontally from the edge of a vertical cliff and reaches the water 2.00 s later. How high was the cliff and how far from the base of the cliff did he hit the water? II. (a) How long does it take a brick to reach the ground if dropped from a height of 50.0 m? (b) what will be it's velocity just before it reaches the ground? III. A baseball (m = 0.140 kg) traveling at 30.0 m/s moves a fielder's glove backward by 0.0.00150 m when the baseball is caught. (a) What work was done on the glove and (b) what force was exerted by the ball on the glove? IV. Two particles, of mass 5.00 kg and 7.00 kg are mounted 4.00 m apart on a light rod. Calculate the moment of inertia of the system (a) when rotated about an axis halfway between the masses and (b) when the system rotates about an axis located 0.500 m to the left of the 5.00 kg mass. V. A car coasts down a hill of height 40.0 m. Calculate (a) the velocity of the car at the bottom of the hill and (b) at what height will it have half this speed? VI. A 18.0 kg box is released on a 33.0deg incline and accelerates down the incline at 0.300 m/s2. What is the coefficient of friction for the incline? VII.  The planet Venus orbits the Sun in a nearly perfect circle of radius 1.08 x 1011 m. The angular    velocity of Venus is 1.63 rev/yr. Determine the tangential speed of Venus in m/s. (There are 3.16 x  107 seconds/year.) VIII.  A baseball is thrown with an initial velocity of 100 m/s at an angle of 30.0deg above the horizontal. How far from the starting point will the baseball reach it's original height? IX. A turntable platter has a radius of 0.150 m and is rotating at 3.49 rad/s. When the power is shut off, the platter comes to a rest in 15.0 seconds due to a retarding torque of -6.20 x 10-3 N m. Assume the platter to be a uniform disk. Determine (a) the angular acceleration (in rad/s2) and (b) the mass of the  platter. X. A nearsighted sheriff fires at a cattle rustler with his trusty six-shooter. Fortunately for the cattle rustler, the bullet misses him and penetrates the town water tank to cause a leak. The top of the tank is open to the atmosphere so P1 = P2, determine the speed at which the water leaves the hole when the water level is 0.500 m above the hole. Assume that v2 [?] 0 since the surface area of the tank is so much larger than that of the hole.  XI. If 1.40 x 10-7 g of nitrogen gas is held at 27degC in a container that a volume of 5.00 x 10-3 m3, what is  the gas pressure in the container? XII. If 0.200 kg of tea at 95degC is poured into a 0.150 kg glass cup initially at 25degC, what will be the final  temperature when equilibrium is reached?

Kai Keoni has created custom statues made out of scrap metal for over ten years. He lives above his shop in Martha's Vineyard, Maryland. Kai is an accounting fanatic and has kept detailed records of every statue he has ever created. For every sale, he obtains the customer's name and address, a description of the statue, and a picture of the statue sold to the customer. His unique style has recently attracted the attention of several celebrities. Ready to take his business to the next level, Kai has hired you to construct an accounting information system, which he wants modeled after his paper records. As you look over his records, you notice that some customer last names have different first names in different records. For example, R. Framington Farnsworth, Bob Farnsworth, and Snake Farnsworth all seem to be the same person. You explain to Kai that every customer must be identified by a unique customer number in the AIS. You are referring to the

In January 2017, Neil called Sloane's employer, the University of Florida, and reported that he thought "the blonde in financial aid" had stolen $10,000. Sloane is the only blonde in financial aid. Without investigating, the University of Florida swiftly fired Sloane. After spending nearly two and a half years battling the mental health effects from the false accusation, Sloane decided she was ready to sue earlier this month. Part of Sloane's decision to sue arose from the Independent Florida Alligator's May 2019 article detailing UF's improper firing of Sloane based on unfounded allegations. Analyze Sloane's defamation case against Neil. Detail the elements of the claim and any defenses Neil may have available. (200 word limit, 7 points)

In Drosophila, the recessive allele p, when homozygous, determines pink eyes. Pp or PP results in wild-type eye color. On the same chromosome of Drosophila that carries the p (pink eyes) locus, there is another locus that affects the wings. Homozygous recessives, byby, have blistery wings, whereas the dominant allele By produces wild-type wings. The P and By loci are very close together on the chromosome; that is, the two loci are tightly linked. Assume that no crossing over occurs, and that the F2 generation is produced by interbreeding the F1 progeny. For the cross PPByBy x ppbyby, what is the genotype ratio of the F2 generation

Give your answers to questions 3.1.1 - 3.1.4 as fractions.      3.1.1   What is the probability of the dice landing on an even number?   (1)     3.1.2   What is the probability of the dice landing on a number that is not a multiple of 4?   (1)     3.1.3   What is the probability of the dice landing on a square number?   (1)     3.1.4   What is the probability of the dice landing on 12?   (1)     3.1.5   Redraw the following number line and indicate ALL your answers from questions 3.1.1 - 3.1.4 on the number line.    (2)               3.2   The following two-way table shows different tigers in captivity in a particular country.      Bengal   Siberian   Sumatran   Total     Male   14   9   3   26     Female   17   4   13   34     Total   31   13   16   60      As part of a zoological study, the health of the tigers are being monitored.   *Hint for interpreting the table: The total column at the end shows the total for each row; the total row at the bottom shows the total for each column.

Be sure to write equations, draw Free body diagrams if needed, and show all your work. A box of consume flavored potato chips rests on a horizontal table connected by a string to a hanging box of thunder-burgers. The system starts from rest and begins moving.  Using energy, find the speed of system after m2 has descended 0.80 m.  (Note, this means that m1 moves 0.80 m to the right.)

Suppose we want to implement a random number guessing game.  First, our program should choose a pseudo-random number in the range of 1 to 100 that varies each time we run the program through the use of a unique random number seed.  Second, the player will pick a value.  Third, our program will check the user's guess against the selected random number and tell them if their guess is too high or too low relative to the random number selected by our program.  Fourth, our program will output a congratulations message and the number of tries it took for the user to guess the correct random number. The object of our game is to see how many guesses it takes for the player to guess the right answer. Fill out the correct sequence of the pseudocode statements below that most closely matches the description above in order to design a solution to implement this Random Number guessing game. Pseudocode:  Random Number Guessing Game [1] [2] [3]         [a]         Get another guess [4]

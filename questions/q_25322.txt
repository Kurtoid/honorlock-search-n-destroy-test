FULL SOLUTION PROBLEM:  For the following question, write down the final answers here, but you must submit a full solution including Given, Find, EQU, all mathematical steps, and include units.  Work on this problem should be submitted to the Test #3 Work Submission assignment no more than 15 minutes after the completion of this test. A 1000kg 'Toyota Sadan' car is stopped at an intersection. A large 4000kg 'GMC Truck' approaches from behind with a velocity of 25m/s and finds itself on a sheet of ice, unable to slow down or change direction and collide with the car. After the collision, they become entangled.  Make a labeled sketch of this physical scenario (before and after collision) and include a table of Givens and Finds next to your sketch [1 pts]. Find the speed of the combined wreckage (car+Truck) immediately after the collision [2 pts] If the collision lasts 0.1 seconds, find the magnitude of the average force acting on the car [1 pts]. Find the kinetic energy lost if any due to this collision [1 pts.]

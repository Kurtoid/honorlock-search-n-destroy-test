Tableau Task 4        (max 10 pts)   Create a new worksheet in your Tableau workbook.  Name it "Filled Map".   Management wants a map that shows how many restaurants are in each state. An unskilled user should be able to change the map to display either all of our restaurants or to filter for a single chain.   Create a filled map visualization as follows:  States where we have zero restaurants should not be filled. States where we have at least one restaurant should be completely filled. The color of the fill should be controlled by the number of restaurants.  The CEO just loves red.  Please setup the map to use shades of red.  More restaurants = darker red.  Fewer restaurants = lighter red. Setup a filter based on the restaurant chain name.  There should be an easily-accessible control on the screen so that an unskilled user can quickly change the filter to display a different chain (or all of the chains) by just clicking a checkbox.    NOTES:   This task will be graded manually, based on our evaluation of the TWBX file you submit.

F table.pdf  1. (5 points) Multiple-choice questions:     (1) For analysis of variance, the term "two-way" refers to: (0.5 points)         (A) The number of factors         (B) The number of levels         (C) The number of replications         (D) The number of elements in each group         (E) The number of combinations of factors     (2) In a one-way ANOVA F test, "the among group" variation is attributable to: (0.5 points)         (A) SS Treatment         (B) SS Error         (C) SS Total         (D) SS Interaction         (E) MSA/MSE     (3) When the k population means are truly different from each other, it is likely that the average error deviation: (0.5 points)         (A) is relatively large compared to the average treatment deviations         (B) is relatively small compared to the average treatment deviations         (C) is about equal to the average treatment deviation         (D) none of the above         (E) differ significantly between at least two of the populations     (4) When conducting a one-way ANOVA, the      the between-treatment variability is when compared to the within-treatment variability, the      the value of FDATA will be tend to be. (0.5 points)         (A) smaller, larger         (B) smaller, smaller         (C) larger, larger         (D) smaller, more random         (E) larger, more random     (5) When conducting an ANOVA, FVALUE (CALCULATED ) will always fall within what range? (0.5 points)         (A) between negative infinity and infinity         (B) between 0 and 1         (C) between 0 and infinity         (D) between 1 and infinity     (6) If FDATA follows an F distribution with df1=4 and df2=5, what is the boundary value of F where P(FDATA < F) = 0.95? (0.5 points)         (A) 0.05         (B) 5.19         (C) 6.25         (D) 15.52         (E) 11.39     (7) Suppose the critical region for a certain test of the null hypothesis is of the form F > 9.48773 and the computed value of F from the data is 1.86. Then choose the correct answer:  (0.5 points)                   I: H0 should be rejected.                   II : The significance level is given by the area to the left of 9.48773 under the appropriate F distribution.                   III : The significance level is given by the area to the right of 9.48773 under the appropriate F distribution.                   IV : The hypothesis test is two-tailed                   V : Fail to reject H0         (A) I and II         (B) I and III         (C) I and III and IV         (D) III and V         (E) IV and V     (8) Choose the correct option: (0.5 points)                 I: t-distribution is symmetric                 II : chi-square distribution is symmetric                 III : Standard normal distribution is symmetric                 IV : F-distribution is symmetric         (A) Only I is correct         (B) I and III are correct         (C) Only IV is correct         (D) I and IV are correct     (8) An investigator randomly assigns 30 college students into three equal size study groups (early- morning, afternoon, late-night) to determine if the period of the day at which people study has an effect on their retention. The students live in a controlled environment for one week, on the third day of the experimental treatment is administered (study of predetermined material). On the seventh day the investigator tests for retention. In computing his ANOVA table, he sees that his MS within groups is larger than his MS between groups. What does this result indicate? (1 point)         (A) An error in the calculations was made.         (B) There was more than the expected amount of variability between groups.         (C) There was more variability between subjects within the same group than there was between groups.         (D) There should have been additional controls in the experiment. 2. (30 points) Let x1, x2, x3 be independent random variables that have normal distribution N(mi, s2), i = 1, 2, 3.

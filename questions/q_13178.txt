One of the requirements that must be met before constructing a confidence interval for a population proportion is that there be at least 5 successes and 5 failures. Describe why the following scenario meets this condition. In a study of the accuracy of fast food drive-through orders, approximately 20% of the 264 Burger King orders were inaccurate. Note: You do not need to construct a confidence interval. You just need to determine whether the condition is met.   Problem adapted from book.

TURN YOUR PHONE ON SILENT AND PUT IT AWAY! I understand that: a. This test should be taken in a quiet room. I am not allowed to talk to others during the test. Talking to others will result in a zero on the test. b. I am not allowed to use any device other than the testing computer for any reason during the test and doing so and will result in a zero on the test.  c. The use of books, notes, papers, phones, tablets, other computers, personal assistants (Siri, Alexa, Hey Google), etc. is strictly prohibited during the testing session and will result in a zero on the test. d. I am not allowed to open any other web pages on the testing computer during the test. Leaving the test page will result in a zero on the test. e. I am required to look straight ahead with my face clearly in view of the webcam and remain in view of the camera for the entire session. If I leave the camera view I will receive a zero for this test.  Type your name in the box below to acknowledge that you agree to comply with the above-stated testing procedures and the Virtual Proctoring Guidelines in the introductory module. To do otherwise would constitute academic dishonesty.

Using the following information, deduce the sequence of the original octapeptide.  Write the original peptide sequence in order using one-letter codes for the amino acid in the appropriate blanks.  A list of peptide cleavage reagents and their specificities are shown below. 1.  Total acid hydrolysis:  Arg, Glu, Gly (2.0 equivalents), Lys, Ser (2.0 equivalents), Thr 2.  Trypsin:  2 products.  Each was isolated and hydrolyzed with acid and their amino acid compositions were determined:  #1 (Lys, Ser (2.0 equivalents)); #2 (Arg, Glu, Gly (2.0 equivalents), Thr) 3.  Staphylococcus aureus V8:  2 products.  Each was isolated and hydrolyzed with acid and their amino acid compositions were determined:  #1 (Arg, Gly (2.0 equivalents)); #2 (Glu, Lys, Ser (2.0 equivalents), Thr)   [amino_acid_1]-[amino_acid_2]-[amino_acid_3]-[amino_acid_4]-[amino_acid_5]-[amino_acid_6]-[amino_acid_7]-[amino_acid_8]   Reagents for peptide cleavage ArgC:  Cleaves after Arg AspN:  Cleaves before Asp Carboxypeptidase:  Liberates the C-terminal amino acid as long as this residue is not Pro.  If the C-terminal residue is Pro, there is no reaction Chymotrypsin:  Cleaves after Leu, Phe, Trp, Tyr CNBr:  Cleaves after Met LysC:  Cleaves after Lys Staphylococcus aureus V8:  Cleaves after Asp, Glu Thermolysin:  Cleaves before most hydrophobic residues Trypsin:  Cleaves after Lys, Arg

Problem Solving Question 4. The table on the top shows the top four statistically significant results of the GWAS for impulsivity. Assume each SNP has the same exact effect size but differs only in its sign, where "beta" represents the direction (either positive or negative) of the SNP's effect allele (A1) on impulsivity. For instance, + means that the A allele of rs00001 has a positive association with impulsivity. The table on the bottom shows the genotypes at each SNP for four different people within the same family.

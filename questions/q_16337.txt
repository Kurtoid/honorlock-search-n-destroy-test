Distance walked on a six-minute test was the outcome measure. (a) Name the experimental design and list the specific F tests required to analyze the data. (b) Write a research hypothesis for the interaction term. (c) Write a null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis for the interaction term.

Dr. Disney has been raising exotic fruit flies for decades. Recently, he discovered a strain of fruit flies that in the recessive condition have baby blue eyes that he designates as bb. He also has another strain of fruit flies that in the recessive condition have pink wings that are designated as pw. He is able to establish flies that are homozygous for both mutant traits. He mates these two strains with each other. Dr. Disney then takes phenotypically wild-type females from this cross and mates them with double recessive males. In the resulting testcross progeny he observes 500 flies that are of the following make-up:            41       with baby blue eyes and pink wings      207       with baby blue eyes only      210       with pink wings only     42       with wild-type phenotype

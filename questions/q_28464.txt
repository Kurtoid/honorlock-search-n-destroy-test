According to the size principle, in which order are motor units recruited in response to increasing synaptic input? (FR: Fast Fatigue-Resistant, S: Slow, FF: Fast Fatigable)
Page replacement algorithms. For the same reference string shown in the previous question (Question 33), and for the same number of frames (3), run the Second Chance Algorithm, showing the content of the frames as well as their R bits at each reference. Indicate at each reference if a page fault happened by indicating Y/N "PF". Hint: linearizing the presentation of your answer will be easier in Canvas. So just follow this format of a "vertical" answer: 2 F1: x, R: 0 or 1 F2: x, R: 0 or 1 F3: x, R: 0 or 1 PF: No or Yes   3 F1: x, R: 0 or 1 F2: x, R: 0 or 1 F3: x, R: 0 or 1 PF: No or Yes

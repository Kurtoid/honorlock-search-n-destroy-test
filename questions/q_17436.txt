A COSC intern prior to his internship was required to complete an ethics and safety 1 course.    As a result, the intern was knowledgeable of general ethical principles, and had been issued an OSHA 10-Hour certification card.   He went to work alongside a very senior and experienced field superintendent in a residential construction company.   He enjoyed working with the superintendent and was learning new things every day.   As a result of the increased emphasis on compliance with OSHA requirements, the company put forth a requirement that all employees must acquire their OSHA 10-Hour card within two months using an online, self-paced training and testing program.  Each employee was issued a user name and password to access the online OSHA course and test.  The intern asked and was given permission to not take the exam since he already had an OSHA 10-Hour card.    On Wednesday, two days prior to the Friday deadline for taking the course and exam, the superintendent gave the intern his personal user name and password, and told the intern to go on line and complete the course and exam for him before Friday.  The intern likes the superintendent and feels some obligation in repayment for how helpful the superintendent had been.  The intern still had 10 weeks remaining on his internship and is assigned to work with this superintendent until the end of the internship.   1) Do you think it is ethical for the intern to take the OSHA 10 class for the superintendent?   2) What would you do if you were the intern?

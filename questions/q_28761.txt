QUESTION #4 (COLLEGE-LEVEL SPANISH INSTRUCTION) Application question: Analyze the Spanish class presented in the case study, according to the following topics.    Methodology/ approaches Theoretical assumption of the teacher (empiricist or rationalist) Task sequencing (Brandl, 2008): Input, assimilation, and task Role of the instructor and learners Role of L1 versus L2 Role and type of feedback (explicit versus implicit) Proficiency outcome prediction in terms of oral production, e.g., what learners would be able to produce at the end of the semester, if classes continue in this fashion.    Support all your answers with the content of the readings and discussions carried on in class and specific examples from the case study. For example, it is not enough to say the teacher is an empiricist, you need to define "empiricist" and then give evidence from the case study supporting the characteristics of this theoretical posture.   CASE STUDY: Spanish class  PHASE I Teacher:            -Buenos dias. ?Como estan, bien? Bueno, hoy vamos a hablar de *la familia, la familia, ?si?  (Says, as he writes "familia" on the board).

You have isolated several strains (Strains YOU200, YOU201, and YOU202) of S. pneumoniae that you think may have mutations in competence genes. You grow the strains, treat them with extra competence peptide to induce competence, and give them DNA you radiolabeled with phosphorus-32 (6000 counts/min). At various times you treat the culture with DNase.  You then precipitate the culture with acid and collect the precipitate on a filter. You take radioactivity readings of the filters and compare your mutants to the wild type strain T4R. Results:        T4R         - 3000 counts/min        YOU200 - 2998 counts/min        YOU201 - 20 counts/min        YOU202 - 6000 counts/min What can you determine about each mutant? YOU200 [answer1] YOU201 [answer2] YOU202 [answer3]

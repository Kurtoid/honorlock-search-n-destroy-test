Selection #2       Much misinformation exists about drug usage.  A study conducted by the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center found the highest rates of drug use among unemployed youth and in military camps, not as commonly believed, among college students.  College students used drugs at a rate about equal to that of the average for people of the same age in all walks of life.  Some 70 to 85 percent of the young men studied disapproved of the use of illegal drugs (except marijuana) even on an experimental basis.   Despite the widely reported upsurge in the use of marijuana, the number of youth who have tried regularly using alcohol (weekly or oftener) has decreased.  Still other data from Gallup surveys reveal that the number of college students who said they had tried marijuana had jumped from 5 percent in 1967 to 51 percent in 1971.  The biggest increase was registered between 1969 and 1970 when the percentage almost doubled, from 22 to 42 percent.  It is conceivable that marijuana will peak out and stabilize as in the case of alcohol usage (a segment of the population remaining non-users).   It is also conceivable that marijuana will become legally available to adults within the next twenty years, but be regulated, as is alcohol, for underage use.  Marijuana will then have similar coming-of-age connotations as drinking beer and whiskey has today.  Yet there are strong traditions working against legalization of marijuana.  America may solve its dilemma by having its cake and eating it, too.  As Thurman Arnold put it, "Most unenforced criminal laws survive in order to satisfy moral objections to established modes of conduct.  They are unenforced because we want to continue our conduct and unrepealed because we want to preserve our morals."  This has occurred with largely unenforced laws against adultery and fornication; it happened to a lesser extent during Prohibition; and it could also occur with our marijuana laws.

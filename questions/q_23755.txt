Suppose we have a 6 points in 2D space: A1(0, 0), A2(0, 4), A3(2, 1), A4(2, 3), A5(4, 0), A6(4, 4) and would like to run k-means clustering on the 6 points with k = 2 (where k is cluster number), using Euclidean distance. Now if we choose the A1 and A2 as the initial cluster centroids,  What is the final clustering result(final centroids and assignment of points to each cluster)? Please also show the intermediate results from each iteration.

Four identical particles (mass of each = 0.24 kg) are placed at the vertices of a rectangle (2.0 m x 3.0 m) and held in those positions by four light rods which form the sides of the rectangle. What is the moment of inertia (in kgxm2) of this rigid body about an axis that passes through the center of mass of the body and is parallel to the shorter sides of the rectangle?   Hint: First find the center of mass location, that will become the axis of rotation.

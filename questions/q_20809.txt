An automated repair center needs to complete 100 maintenance jobs in the next three days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday), of which 50 will arrive on Monday morning and 50 on Tuesday morning. Two repair robots are available: regular and advanced. Due to other activities, the number of jobs that each can complete per day varies: regular robot can complete [r1] jobs on Monday, [r2] on Tuesday and [r3] on Wednesday; advanced robot can do 50 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday and 40 on Wednesday. Assigning a job to the regular robot is free, while assigning a job to the advanced robot costs $100 on Monday, $400 on Tuesday and $300 on Wednesday. Additionally, each day that a job is not completed costs $150. The problem is to determine how many jobs each robot performs on each day so that the total cost is minimized. Draw a network, so that solving the minimum cost flow problem on it gives the optimal solution. On your paper, draw the network and explain your solution. Leave the field below blank. You do not need to find the optimal solution. Hint: create two nodes with ``supply'' of jobs for each of the two days, nodes to represent each robot on each day, and an additional node to collect all completed jobs. Make sure each arc has cost and capacity.

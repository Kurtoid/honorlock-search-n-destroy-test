Planck's treatment (see below) of radiant light eliminated the erroneous "ultraviolet catastrophe." The equation below gives the rate of change in the energy density versus the change in the wavelength (dr/dl).  Calculate dr/dl at the following temperature and wavelength values.
Seattle Radiology Group plans to invest in a new CT scanner. The group estimates $1,500 net revenue per scan. Preliminary market assessments indicate that demand will be less than 5,000 scans per year. The group is considering a scanner (Scanner A) that would result in total fixed costs of $1,000,000 and would yield a profit of $500,000 per year at a volume of 5,000 scans. What is the implied variable cost rate (variable cost per scan) for Scanner A?

A system consists of two particles. At t = 0 one particle is at the origin; the other, which has a mass of 0.50 kg, is on the y-axis at y = 6.0m. At t = 0 the center of mass of the system is on the y-axis at 2.4 m. The velocity of the center of mass is given by (0.75m/s3)t2i . Find the acceleration of the center of mass at 10 s.

All of the other members on John's basketball team can shoot free-throws with at least 80% accuracy. John, though, is only a 60% shooter. So, he practices for long hours and his team members praise him for doing so. After a week of this, his accuracy improves to his teammates' average of 80%. Which of the following best describes the above situation?
Smooth muscle contraction requires the actions of myosin light chain kinase.

A freight train consists of engines (mengine=100,000 kg) and cars (mcar=50,000 kg). Each engine is capable of exerting 5.00 x 105 N force on the track to accelerate the train forward. For the questions below, show in detail how you get to the solution of the problems. a) Assuming that the train is composed of 2 engines and 50 cars, what is the force of kinetic friction acting on the train? Ignore the force of drag. b) For the same train from part (a), what is the acceleration of the train? Consider that the train is already moving. Ignore the force of drag. c) Considering the drag force acting on the train, what is the terminal velocity of the train from part (a)? Do NOT ignore friction. d) If the train from part (a) is making a curve with 2.00 km of diameter at 72km/h, what is the centripetal acceleration of the train? Express the results in m/s2. e) If the train is now composed of 80 cars, what is the minimal number of engines necessary to make the train start moving? Suggestion: assume that the train is stopped, then use the static friction force of the cars to estimate the number of engines. Do NOT forget that the engines also have friction forces acting on them. Ignore the force of drag.   Useful information: The static friction coefficient between the train and the tracks is

Given the code below, what gets printed? Assume that Test inherits from an appropriate exception class. It is recommended that you trace this on scratch paper and look for your answer in the choices provided. public class Catcher {     public static void main(String[] args) {        Test testException = new Test("Test Thrown");        try {           throw testException;        } catch (Test f) {             System.out.println(f.getMessage());         } catch (Exception e) {             System.out.println("Exception Thrown");         } finally {             System.out.println("Is this printed?");         }     } }

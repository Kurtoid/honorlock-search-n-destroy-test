Re: Researchers set out to test the impact of Families First, a comprehensive program addressing parent employment and financial stability on participants' children's academic achievement and motivation, and school engagement. Researchers recruited 750 families between July 2008-December 2010. All parents had one or more children between ages 2 and 11 years old and were under-employed and/or low income (under 200% of the federal poverty level). Half of the families (375) were randomly assigned to Families First, and therefore provided with income supplements and important work supports including extensive child-care assistance and health care subsidies. The other half was assigned to a control condition (treatment as usual). At the 5-year follow-up study, when children of all families were between the ages of 7 and 17, researchers conducted interviews with parents, children and teachers. As hypothesized, in comparison to the control-group children, children of Families First families scored significantly higher on academic achievement and motivation to achieve. "Motivation to achieve" was measured in child interviews using 12 questions about perceived ability, expectations for success, and perceived value of studying math and English; responses could range on a 5-point scale from 'not at all'=1 to 'very'=5. Overall, the results of the study suggested that an income/employment intervention for families in poverty can lead to profound, long-term changes in children's educational engagement outlook and achievement.  Answer both a and b in the text box : a. Given the study design, would this study be considered more of a descriptive/correlational or predictive /causal research?  b. Explain your answer to a.

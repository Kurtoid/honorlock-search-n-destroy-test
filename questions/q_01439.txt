TEKS E         AfriForum prys skool met positiewe dissipline Deur Jhua-Nine Wyrley-Birch     1.   "Duidelike riglyne en reels in skole is sinoniem met doeltreffende onderrig en leer."  So se Carien Bloem, AfriForum se projekkoordineerder vir onderwysveldtogte, oor die burgerregte-organisasie se Wandel met Waardigheid-kompetisie, wat ten doel het om skole en leerders bewus te maak van positiewe dissipline op die skoolterrein en in die klaskamer.     2.   Die onderskeie kategoriee van die kompetisie waarvolgens deelnemers beoordeel is, is die skool die beste dissiplinebeleid en die leerder met die beste voorstel om sy/haar skool se bestaande dissiplinebeleid te verbeter.     3.   "Enige skool of leerder het die geleentheid gehad om vir die kompetisie in te skryf," se Bloem.     4.   Hoerskool Middelburg in Mpumalanga is vanjaar met die toekenning vir die skool met die beste dissiplinebeleid bekroon, terwyl Nina Mostert, 'n graad 11-leerder van Helpmekaar Kollege in Johannesburg, die toekenning ontvang het as die leerder met die beste voorstel om haar skool se bestaande dissiplinebeleid te verbeter.     5.   Volgens Bloem ly sowel leerders as onderwysers se werkprestasie onder swak dissipline.  Sy meen dit is belangrik dat dissipline deel van 'n kind se opvoeding en waardestelsel op skool moet wees.  "Dit is belangrik om verantwoordelikheid vir jou dade te neem en kinders moet besef dat gedissiplineerdheid 'n eienskap is wat jy jou hele lewe lank gaan nodig kry."

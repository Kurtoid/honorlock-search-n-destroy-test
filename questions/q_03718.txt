TransWorld Communications Inc., a large telecommunications company, is evaluating the possible acquisition of Georgia Cable Company (GCC), a regional cable company. TransWorld's analysts project the following post-merger data for GCC (in thousands of dollars):             2009   2010   2011   2012     FCF       $  61.4   $  69.7   $  71.7   $  74.8     Tax rate after merger   35%                     Beta after merger   1.5                     Capital structure after merger   50% Debt                     Beta before merger   1.4                     Tax rate before merger   20%                     Capital structure before merger   40% Debt                     Risk-free rate   8%                     Market risk premium   4%                     Terminal growth rate of cash flow available to TransWorld   7%                     If the acquisition is made, it will occur on January 1, 2009. All cash flows shown in the income statements are assumed to occur at the end of the year. GCC currently has a capital structure of 40% debt, but TransWorld would increase that to 50% if the acquisition were made. GCC, if independent, would pay taxes at 20%; but its income would be taxed at 35% if it were consolidated. GCC's current market-determined beta is 1.40, and itsinvestment bankers think that its beta would rise to 1.5 if the debt ratio were increased to 50%. The cost of goods sold is expected to be 65% of sales, but it could vary somewhat. Depreciation-generated funds would be used to replace worn-out equipment, so they would not be available to TransWorld's shareholders. The risk-free rate is 8%, and the market risk premium is 4%. Please answer the following two questions: (1) What is the proper discount rate for valuing this acquisition?

Prove the following statement using induction. "For all positive integers n, 3|(n3 + 2n)."  Use good proof technique.  Note:  To avoid the need for typing superscript exponents, you may use the expression 'n^3' to represent n3. Grading rubric:1 pt. State the basis step, then prove it.1 pt. State the inductive hypothesis.2 pt. Complete the proof of the inductive step.1 pt. State the final conclusion at the end of the proof.1 pt. Label each part: the basis step, inductive hypothesis, inductive step, and conclusion.

In the pea plants that Mendel studied, purple/violet flowers are dominant to white flowers and yellow peas are dominant to green peas. The alleles designated for each phenotype are W for purple/violet flowers, w for white flowers, G for yellow peas, and g for green peas.  Part I: You are provided two plants with the genotypes GgWw and ggWW. What are the phenotypes for each parent and which of Mendel's Laws did you use to determine these phenotypes? Part II: Now you must cross these plants together to yield an F1 generation. Write out the expected gametes for each parent. You will use Mendel's final two laws to generate their gametes. State the two laws and define them in the context of these parents. Part III: Before you count and quantify the F1 generation plants, you want to determine the theoretical genotypic distribution of offspring. Perform a dihybrid cross using the parental gametes you generated previously (do the dihybrid cross in a separate piece of paper with your name on it). This drawing will be graded separately for 1 point and the score will be added to your Exam.Then, write  both the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of the F1 generation (in the space provided in this test). Note: You must label your answers as Part I, Part II and Part III. All answers must be provided in the space below. For the dihybrid cross Punnet square in Part III you will have 30 minutes after you finish your test to submit all the drawings to the "Exam 1 Part 2" assignment on the "Exams" link. You can submit the file as a pdf or a jpeg file. The questions will only be shown in the actual exam, so it is important to complete the drawing before submitting/disconnecting from your exam.

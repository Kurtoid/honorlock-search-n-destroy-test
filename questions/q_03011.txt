Consider the following homogeneous gas phase reaction with value of Kc: COCl2(g) = CO(g) + Cl2(g)              Kc = 8.33 x 10-4 MA reaction mixture initially contains 1.6 M COCl2.   Calculate the approximate molar concentration of CO gas in the equilibrium by recognizing the assumption you can make when Kc is MUCH LESS than 1.  Tip: complete and fill in the partially completed ICE table provided.     COCl2 (Molarity) CO (Molarity) Cl2 (molarity)   Initial 1.6 M 0 M 0 M   Change -1x     Equilibrium 1.6 - 1x = ?

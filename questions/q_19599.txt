You read a report that claims that 78% of community college students use social networking sites. You assume this is also true at Valencia College. To check that assumption you select a random sample of 60 Valencia College students and ask if they use social networking sites. If many samples of size 60 were collected from this population and what you assumed were true, label the sketch of the p-hat sampling distribution below with the mean (rounded to two decimal places) and three standard deviations (rounded to three decimal places) in each direction.  A = [A]     B = [B]    C = [C]    D = [D]     E = [E]     F = [F]     G = [G]

Mannose is a naturally occurring sugar that is important to human metabolism. Mannose can exist in an open chain form (D-mannose) or can cyclize to form a cyclic structure (a-D-mannopyranose). Answer the questions below about D-mannose and a-D-mannopyranose.  Which of the Fischer projections (A-F) below represent D-mannose? [Fischer]   Which of the chair conformations (T-Z) below represent the MOST stable conformation of a-D-mannopyranose? [chair1] Which of the chair conformations (T-Z) below represent the LEAST stable conformation of a-D-mannopyranose? [chair2]  How many total possible stereoisomers are there for a-D-mannopyranose (including the one drawn)? [stereopyr] How many diastereomers are possible for D-mannose?

Let K5 be a complete graph on 5 vertices labeled A, B, C, D, and E. How many different simple circuits of length 5 are there in K5? For this question, consider two circuits different if they use different edges. For example, the circuit ABCDEA uses the same edges as AEDBCA, which is the same circuit in reverse, so we consider it the same circuit. Furthermore, the circuit ABCDEA is considered the same as the circuit BCDEAB, even though the "starting point" is different, because it uses the same edges.

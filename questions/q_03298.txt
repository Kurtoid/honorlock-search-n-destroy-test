Problem No. 3   A rigid bar ACDB is pinned at end A and supported by vertical wires of the same material (E=210GPa) and  equal cross section area (A=80 mm2) at point C and point D as shown below  .  The  coefficient of thermal expansion of steel is       alpha = 12x10-6/oC. The dimensions are         c = 0.8m,  d =2.4m and L = 3.0m. The vertical force P = 10 kN.    With this information answer the following question: Question 3.3: When the load P is already applied the temperature was raised by 30oC what will be the tension in wire at C?

*** For this question, upload a .cpp file (source code) only. Any other file type submitted will result a score of zero (0) for this question.*** Distance traveled: The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follow:            distance = speed * time For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles. Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how many hours it has traveled. It should then use a loop to display the total distance traveled at the end of each hour of that period of time.  Do not hard-code the result values in your program. They must be calculated by using mathematical expressions based on the speed and the number of hours that the user inputs. Sample run 1:  Sample run 2:

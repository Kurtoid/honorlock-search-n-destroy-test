Comrade Ossipon, nicknamed the Doctor, went out of the Silenus beer-hall.  At the door he hesitated, blinking at a not too splendid sunlight--and the paper with the report of the suicide of a lady was in his pocket.  His heart was beating against it.  The suicide of a lady--this act of madness or despair. *** His revolutionary career, sustained by the sentiment and trustfulness of many women, was menaced by an impenetrable mystery--the mystery of a human brain pulsating wrongfully to the rhythm of journalistic phrases.  " . . . Will hang for ever over this act. . . . It was inclining towards the gutter . . . of madness or despair."    "I am seriously ill," he muttered to himself with scientific insight.  Already his robust form, with an Embassy's secret-service money (inherited from Mr Verloc) in his pockets, was marching in the gutter as if in training for the task of an inevitable future.  Already he bowed his broad shoulders, his head of ambrosial locks, as if ready to receive the leather yoke of the sandwich board.  As on that night, more than a week ago, Comrade Ossipon walked without looking where he put his feet, feeling no fatigue, feeling nothing, seeing nothing, hearing not a sound.  "An impenetrable mystery. . . ."  He walked disregarded. . . .  "This act of madness or despair."    And the incorruptible Professor walked too, averting his eyes from the odious multitude of mankind.  He had no future.  He disdained it.  He was a force.  His thoughts caressed the images of ruin and destruction.  He walked frail, insignificant, shabby, miserable--and terrible in the simplicity of his idea calling madness and despair to the regeneration of the world.  Nobody looked at him.  He passed on unsuspected and deadly, like a pest in the street full of men.

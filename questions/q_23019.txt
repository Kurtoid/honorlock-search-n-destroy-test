Draw a state diagram for the following scenario. The system waits in idle state until a transaction is initiated or a change in grocery checkout personnel occurs. In the latter case, the current grocery checkout person logs out of the system and the system waits for the new user (checkout person) to log on. Once the new user is logged on to the system, the system returns to the idle state. A transaction is initiated when a new item is either scanned or entered in the system. After each scan or entry of an item, the system displays the running total amount for that transaction. This continues as more items are entered. Once all the items in that transaction are entered or scanned, the checkout personnel signals the end of that transaction and the system displays the total amount for that transaction if there are no discount coupons. However, if a discount coupon is scanned, the system then subtracts double the value of each coupon from the total amount of the transaction. This continues until there are no more coupons remaining to be processed in this transaction. The checkout person then signals the end of this transaction. The customer pays the total amount either by cash, check, or credit card. If the payment is by cash, the checkout person accepts the amount and the transaction is completed when the system prints out the receipt. The system then returns to the idle state. If the payment is either by check or by credit card, the system authorizes the payment and then prints out the receipt. The system then returns to the idle state and waits for another transaction to begin.

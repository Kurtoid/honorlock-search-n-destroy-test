Assuming that the rate constants for the initiator dissociation (kd), chain propagation (kp) and chain termination (kt) in free radical chain growth polymerization can be expressed by the following equations.  kd = Ad exp (-Ed/RT) kp = Ap exp (-Ep/RT) kt = At exp (-Et/RT)   (a) Calculate the changes in (i) the rate of polymerization rp and (ii) the degree of polymerization Xn as a result of increasing the polymerization temperature of styrene from 60 oC to 80 oC. The initiator used is azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN). The corresponding activation energies are Ed = 126 kJ/mol, Ep = 34 kJ/mol, and Et = 10 kJ/mol, respectively.   (b) Based on the result in (a), explain both quantitatively and qualitatively why the degree of polymerization increases (or decreases) when the temperature increases.   Assume that both concentrations of monomer and initiator as well as initiator efficiency f remain unchanged during polymerization when the temperature is increased. And there is no chain transfer. Gas constant R = 8.314 J mol-1 K-1

Question 1 Consider the following sequence: 15 ; 11 ; 7 ; 3 ; -1 ; ...    1.1  If this pattern continues consistently, determine the   term of the sequence.  (3)   1.2  Show that - 293 is a term of the sequence.  (2)    1.3   Using the given sequence above, a new sequence is formed as follows: The first term is the same as the first term of the given sequence. The second term equals the sum of the first 2 terms of the given sequence. The third term is the sum of the first 3 terms of the given sequence. The fourth term is the sum of the first 4 terms of the given sequence and so on. Write down the first 4 terms of the new sequence.  (1)     1.4   Determine an expression for the nth term,  , for this new sequence if it continues in the way described in QUESTION 1.3.   (5)     1.5      An arithmetic sequence:   is given. A new sequence is formed with a as first term, the sum of the first 2 terms of the given sequence as second term, the sum of the first 3 terms of the given sequence as third term and the sum of the first 4 terms of the given sequence as fourth term and it continues in this way.

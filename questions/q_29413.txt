"You do some thinking.  You hallucinate.  You look ahead a few paces and wonder what your legs will resemble if there is no more to the earth in that spot than silicates and nitrogen.  Will the pain be unbearable?  Will you scream and fall silent?  Will you be afraid to look at your own body, afraid of the sight of your own red flesh and white bone? . . .  It is not easy to fight this sort of self-defeating fear, but you try.  You decide to be ultra-careful---the hard-nosed realistic approach.  You try to second-guess the mine.  Should you put your foot to that flat rock or the clump of weeds to its rear?  Paddy dike or water?  You wish you were Tarzan, able to swing on the vines.  You trace the footprints of the men to your front.  You give up when he curses you for following them too closely; better one man dead than two."          ~~Tim O'Brian, A Life in a Year: The American Infantryman in Vietnam, 1965-1972     What is O'Brian worried about?
Which type of lipid is most important in biological membranes?

A study published in 2019 provided data that suggests that killer whales may have important non-consumptive effects on white shark behavior.  The paper indicates that although white sharks and killer whales show overlap in where they occur in the nearshore areas of Southeast Farallon Islands (SEFI) as shown in the map below, white sharks actively avoid the area during the period when killer whales are most abundant despite the fact that elephant seals, their main prey, are very abundant. The graphs below show that: A) elephant seals are very abundant in the spring and fall, but B) white sharks are only really abundant during the fall because C) killer whales are very abundant during the spring.  The other thing that the paper showed is that during the fall when the white sharks and killer whales were both present within the area, tagged white sharks would quickly leave the area when killer whales would show up.  Graph B below is a good example: it shows that sharks were very abundant in the SEFI from Oct-Nov until killer whales showed up (the orange line in B are white sharks; looks how it drops in Nov).  The picture in D shows that when the killer whales showed up, the sharks moved from the Islands (where the green, purple, yellow, and orange diamonds are) to other locations (where the blue diamond is).  Cowards!   So what we may have here is an example of a top-down trophic system that may regularly experience a behaviorally-mediated trophic cascade (such as the "fear ecology" I talked about for tiger sharks and their prey in Shark bay, Australia). Scientists love to form predictions based on data such as these and then test them. Given this, which of the following predictions is UNLIKELY TO BE TRUE about this system?

Bonus (6 points.) A 60.0 g piece of metal was heated in boiling water to 100.0 oC   and then dropped into water (cwater = 4.184 J/g*oC) in an insulated beaker.  There are 55.0 mL of water (density = 1.00g/mL) in the beaker, and its temperature before the metal was dropped in was 24.0 oC. The final temperature of the metal and water is 27.2 oC. What is the specific heat of the metal? Assume that no heat transfers through the walls of the beaker or to the atmosphere.  (If you wish, you can show math work for possible partial credit.)

Probability Saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) are incredibly slow growing cacti that appear to benefit from the shelter of other desert plants, such as Mesquite (Prosopis) for their first several decades of growth. Researchers surveyed the cacti at Saguaro National Park near Tuscon, AZ to determine the probability of sprouting an arm (a sign the cactus has reached maturity) and location near a nursery plant. (These properties are independent but not mutually exclusive!) Use the addition rule of probabilities and the multiplication rule of probabilities to determine the following probabilities. Include your work in your R script for partial credit!      P|Arm| = 0.22                              P|Nursery| = 0.67 P|NoArm| = 0.78                         P|NoNursery| = 0.33   The probability of not sprouting an arm or no nursery plant: [p1] The probability of sprouting an arm or a location near a nursery plant: [p2]  The probability of not sprouting an arm and a location near a nursery plant: [p3] The probability of sprouting an arm and a location near a nursery plant: [p4] The probability of not sprouting an arm and no nursery plant: [p5]

GELO #6 - Question 8 Niko Tinbergen (1907 - 1988) was a Swedish Ethologist (animal behaviorist) famous for studying animals in their native habitats. One of his classic experiments involved a bird called the black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus). Black-headed gulls build nests of twigs on the ground and lay light brown eggs that are covered with dark brown spots. However, the inside of the egg is white in color. Tinbergen noticed that adult gulls pick up the eggshells shortly after a chick has hatched, and fly them to a location far from the nest, where they are left. Since this behavior required expending energy and time that could have been spent feeding and protecting the chicks, Tinbergen wanted to know why the birds did this.     Experiment:  Tinbergen and his co-workers collected gull eggs and painted 69 of them white and left 68 of them with their natural color. (Statistically, these numbers are close enough to be considered equal.) The researchers then scattered the eggs next to a gull breeding area and observed from a nearby blind. Predation rates were recorded for white versus natural colored eggs.      Which step of the scientific method is represented by the following statement?   The white interior of the shell is not camouflaged and attracts predators to the nest. Therefore, the gulls remove the shells to decrease predation.

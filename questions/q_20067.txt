Yang, et al., Mitochondrial origins, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 82: 4443--4447 (1985).  The first eukaryotes acquired mitochondria by endosymbiosis. In studying which living prokaryotes might be most closely related to the ancestor of mitochondria, researchers isolated and cloned nucleotide sequences from the gene that codes for the small-subunit rRNA molecule for six organisms. Cloned rRNA gene sequences for the six organisms were aligned and compared. The data table, called a comparison matrix is shown above.  According to the comparison matrix, which organism is most closely related to the wheat mitochondrial gene?

For the year 2005, the demand for a popular children's board game was Normally distributed with an average of 200 games per store.  During 2006, an advertising campaign was launched in hopes of raising the sales even higher. At the end of 2006, a random sample of 15 stores was selected to see if there was significant evidence to conclude that the average demand had risen.   For these 15 stores, the average demand for the game was found to be 215 games per store and the standard deviation was 35. Assume that demand is still Normally distributed and that there were no outliers in the data. What is the test statistic for this test?
In the logistic population growth model, the per capita rate of population increase approaches zero as the population size (N) approaches the carrying capacity (K), as shown in the table. Assume that rmax = 1.0 and K = 1,500. You can then calculate the population growth rate for four cases where population size (N) is greater than carrying capacity. To do this, use the equation for population growth rate in the table.    Which of these four populations where the population size (N) is greater than the carrying capacity has the highest growth rate?

Read the following abstract very carefully. "Sysetmic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by the activation of autoreactive B cells and the presence of autoreactive antibodies.  Considering the role helper T cells play in the activation of B cells, inhibitors of co-stimulatory molecules have been proposed for the treatment of SLE.  Transgenic mice that develop SLE-like symptoms were treated with inhibitors of specific co-stimulatory molecules and compared to untreated mice.  The amount of activated and differentiated autoreactive T cells was significantly decreased in the treated mice compared to controls." Which of the following is used as a positive control?
Exam Policies  You are allowed to use Quartus II to write, compile, and test your code for this final exam question. You are not allowed to open files related to past work of any kind during the exam.  You should not be seen viewing code from lecture or a previous lab experiment during the exam. You are not allowed to use any outside resources during the exam.  This includes: internet searches, the textbook (hard or soft copy), prior lab reports, another student's work, another person, notes, lecture material, cell phones/tables/other electronic devices. Within Honorlock, you must allow screen sharing at all times.  If screen sharing is stopped, this will be seen as a violation of academic honesty.  If screen sharing is voluntarily ceased, your exam will be penalized with a loss of points, with a maximum penalty of a final exam score of 0 points.   Problem Statement The state diagram for a finite state machine is shown below.  Your assignment is to write a complete VHDL design description of the diagram below, as a two-process or three-process FSM.      Use the following entity for your design. entity code1 isport (        clk, reset_bar, x : in std_logic;        y : out std_logic);end code1; Exam Submission  Write, compile, and functionally simulate your design in Quartus II. Upload a text file of your code to Canvas.  Code should include a header with your name, course, and date. Upload a screenshot of your functional simulation results to Canvas. Type a short description that explains the function (or purpose) of this FSM.

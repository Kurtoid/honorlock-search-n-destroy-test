The antigenic binding site of MHC Type-I  Is located between the Alpha-1 and Alpha-2 globulin domains Has a floor that consists of eight Beta-pleated sheets Prefers to bind nonameric peptides with Leucine or Isoleucine at the amino end and a similar hydrophobic AA in the 2 or 3 position at the Carboxyl end The antigen is bound in the closed ends of the cleft by hydrogen bonds The antigen is presented to the CD8 TCR in a flat planar fashion so it will fit the TCR antigenic pocket

Key equations and a Periodic Table to be used for the whole quiz are included below:pH = -log[H3O+]pH + pOH = 14[H3O+][OH-]=1.0 x 10-14Kw=1.0 x 10-14pKa=-log(Ka)pKa + pKb=14Free Response 1: A 0.30 M solution of weak acid HA has a pH of 4.3. What is the Ka of this acid? (5 points)Free Response 2: Acetic acid, CH3CO2H, has a Ka of 1.8 x 10-5. Determine the pH of a 1.2 M solution of acetic acid. (5 points)Free Response 3: Determine the pH and concentrations of all species present at equilibrium (H2C6H6O6, HC6H6O6-, C6H6O62-, H3O+, and OH-) of a 0.0500 M solution of the diprotic acid, H2C6H6O6. . (12 points)Free Response 4: A solution is created by combining 0.45 moles of NH3 with 0.60 moles of NH4+ in 5.0 L of total solution. If the Kb of NH3 is 1.8 x 10-5, determine the pH of this solution. (5 points)Free Response 5: A titration is run between a solution of HX and NaOH. If the Kb of X- is 1.0 x 10-7 and the concentration of HX and NaOH is 0.30 M before reacting at the equivalence point, determine the pH of this solution at the equivalence point. (5 points)

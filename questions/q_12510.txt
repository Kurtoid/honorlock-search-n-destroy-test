As shown in the figure, a fluid flows upwards inside an enclosed channel.  The thickness of the channel is h, and the length is L. The tilt angle th is marked in the figure. A pressure P is applied upwards by a pump.  The fluid is incompressible, Newtonian, and laminar.  Neglect end effects.  Note the coordinate is defined as shown in the figure as well. (a) Write down the simplified momentum equation based on the defined coordinate. (b) Write down the boundary conditions (c) Find the steady-state velocity distribution in the film. Hint 1: The channel is enclosed (it has a top cover). Be careful with your boundary conditions. Hint 2: Pay attention to the coordinate in the schematic when you determine the signs.

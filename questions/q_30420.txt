In the figure, the magnitude of vector A-{"version":"1.1","math":"vec{A}"} is 18.0 units, and the magnitude of vector B-{"version":"1.1","math":"vec{B}"}  is 12.0 units. Find C-=A-+B-{"version":"1.1","math":"vec{C} = vec{A}+ vec{B}"}.  Use vector components to find your answer, and express the resultant vector  by first  giving its magnitude and then the angle it makes with the +x-axis going counterclockwise.

For this question, do one and only one of the following two choices.  You may not do both or do pieces of both.     Choice #1: Utilizing information from our design psychology topic, describe in your own words what it means to provide the user with the ability to "undo" any action, how providing this is an important design feature, and provide a specific example. Choice #2: Explain, using terms and concepts from our course, why for a person who has learned to drive on a typical vehicle where turning the steering control left causes the vehicle to veer left (and vice versa), it would likely be difficult to drive safely if they were put in a car where turning the steering control left causes the vehicle to veer right (and vice versa).   Provide an example of something in software design that avoids this type of user challenge.

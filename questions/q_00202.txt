Just like we did in lab one (1), identify your own skill/movement.  Once you Identify a skill/activity, classify it in terms of environmental predictability and task organization. For the environmental predictability classification, place an X on the line that represents where you think the activity falls between open and closed.  For the task organization classification, circle (highlight in red) the classification (discrete, serial, or continuous). For you skill/activity, describe one change to the task or environment that would result in a change to the task demands represented by one of your skill classifications and indicate what that change would be. Example Activity: Whitewater kayaking (moderate level of experience).  (1pt) OPEN -X-------------------Closed (1pt)                Discrete   Serial   Continuous (1pt) The rationale for classifications: The environment is constantly changing and probably fairly unpredictable for a person with a moderate level of experience, so it is more open than closed. The primary demand of the task is paddling, which is continuous in nature. (2 pt) Changes to the task or environment: If the task was to practice a kayak roll in a pool (rolls are used in recovering from being capsized), then the task in the environment would become fairly predictable (i.e., it would become more of a closed skill). Because a roll has an identifiable beginning (capsizing) and end (righting oneself), the task would become discrete.   (2pt)   Template:  Skill/Activity: ______________- OPEN - - - - - - - - - - CLOSED    Discrete   Serial   Continuous  The rationale for classifications: Changes to the task or environment:

In deliberating a national rollout in 2015, PDB has set an objective of breaking even on its 2014 "soft launch" advertising budget.  At its proposed retail price of $2.75 per can, Crescent Pure would have to sell about 140,000 cases to break even.  If PDB maintained CP's current retail price of $3.75 per can, the breakeven number of cases would be about 47,000 cases.  When combined with other information in the case, what are the implications of the two breakeven computations for Crescent Pure's positioning?   Consider factors such as production capacity, sales history, customer price perceptions, the impact of the potential positioning, etc. (100-word limit).

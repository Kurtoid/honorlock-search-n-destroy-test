Two boxes are sliding on a horizontal frictionless surface in 1-D.  Box m1 = 4.0 kg, sliding at v1i = +24 m/s (to the right), collides with box m2 = 8.0 kg, sliding at -5.0 m/s (to the left).  They stick together and both boxes collide with a horizontal spring with spring constant 6800 N/m.  a)  Find the velocity of the two boxes after the collision. b)  Find the maximum compression of the spring. Start with given equations.  Show all your work.

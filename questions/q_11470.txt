(Swiderski) Select the most appropriate match for the diseases listed in the following three questions from answers a-e below. (1 point each)[a] Right dorsal colitis[b] Neorickettsia risticii[c] Lawsonia intracellularis[d] Rotavirus a - The most common cause of diarrhea in foals less than 6 months of age. This highly contagious agent has feco-oral transmission and prolonged viability in the environment. Histologic lesions are more severe in the villus tips leading to lactase deficiency and affected foals tend to have a transient high fever and malaise followed by diarrhea and improvement in clinical signs. b - This etiologic agent of diarrhea is most commonly associated with herd outbreaks in horses aged 4-7 months. The agent is spread by feco-oral transmission and causes proliferation of the epithelium, which leads to ileal and jejunal thickening and associated altered secretion, absorption, and profound hypoproteinemia. c - As a cause of diarrhea, this etiology causes a spectrum of mild to severe diarrhea, occurring sporadically along waterways in the US in the summer. This etiology is often identified by marked improvement within 24 hours of administering IV tetracyclined - This disease has a wide spectrum of clinical signs including diarrhea and is generally associated with chronic administration of NSAIDs. Weight loss, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia and recurrent colic are common. e - A very common etiologic agent of acute (and chronic) diarrhea in horses. This disease is difficult to definitively diagnose because the etiologic agent is not detectable until late in the disease course, despite inducing extensive multifocal eosinophilic mucosal damage, predominantly in the ventral colons and cecum.

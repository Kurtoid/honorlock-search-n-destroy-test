Which type of structure indicates an evolutionary relationship between organisms?
Diode D in the Figure above is non-ideal  and the thermal voltage is 0.025V, use the CVD(constant voltage drop =0.7V) diode model to determine how much current flows through the diode and the diode voltage if  vI = 5V,  R = 4kohms and the diode reverse leakage current  IS =  1.5x10-15 A . (Hint:  iterate the answer.  Only few iterations are needed,  You need to calculate the precise vD to find the actual current.)

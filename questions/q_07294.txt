Consider a disk with a mass of m =1 kg that is positioned over an upward flowing free jet of water exiting a nozzle with an area of A = 0.01 m2 and a velocity of V= 2 m/s.  Prior to turning on the nozzle the disk is supported from below at a height of            hinitial = 0.01 m above the jet.  Assuming incompressible flow, the water exits radially after coming into contact with the disk, and the velocity at the exit of the nozzle remains constant once turned on. Determine the following:  The initial acceleration of the disk in m/s2; and  the height of the disk above the nozzle at steady state.

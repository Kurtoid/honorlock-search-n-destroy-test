In risk terms, that is a little under 9 chances in 10 million of that problem occurring. Despite that, CDC and FDA recommended a pause in the use of the vaccine, which has been followed by some states, including Florida.  Most people would take a risk that was about 9 in 10,000,000. Write 3 reasons that the recommendation to pause the use of the vaccine is a good policy decision and 3 that it is not. Is this decision based on scientific evidence or on other considerations? Which are most appropriate, and why?

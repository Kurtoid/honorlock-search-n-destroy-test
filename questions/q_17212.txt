Question 6 54 Points   The pharmacy at EAMC is going to be re-organizing their primary storage room, and needs to decide how many storage bays to allocate to each of the products they need to have on hand.  Only whole storage bays can be assigned (no partial assignments are allowed).     All of the products have been grouped into 8 categories based on their size, frequency of use, and critical status. Hospital policy also dictates that a minimum number of each item must be stored.  This data is provided in the table below.     Category   Size   Frequency   Critical Status   Min Number     Room Temp. Medicine   2   10   20   25     Cold Storage Medicine   1   6   30   10     Non Prescription Medicine   2   15   15   30     Herbal Supplements   3   12   10   10     Bandages   4   20   15   5     Technology   8   5   5   1     Packaging   3   40   5   3     PPE   4   10   5   2           The pharmacy storage room has 60 bays available, and each bay is of size 10.

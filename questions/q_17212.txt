There is no question on this space; please read this passage and view the two graphs, and then answer the final three questions on the test. Scientists in Britain performed an experiment in which they altered the number of eggs in the nest of the small woodland bird Parus major.  By adding eggs to nests or removing eggs from the nests, they manipulated brood size (# of eggs) from 1 to 13.  The parent birds continued to care for the brood and raise the nestlings like normal. In panel (a) below, the researchers measured the average weight of the nestlings at a specific date post-hatching. In panel (b), the researchers estimated survival of the nestlings as a function of body mass.  They recorded whether the baby birds were recovered (seen again or recaptured) 3 months after having fledged (flew away from the nest).  The researchers argue that %recovery is a good index of survival.

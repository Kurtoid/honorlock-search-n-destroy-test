In a population of 100 diploid clams, two alleles at a single locus control the ability to detoxify bacterial contaminants. The allele D codes for an enzyme that can detoxify the contaminant and is completely dominant to d, which codes for a nonfunctional form of the enzyme. In a population of clams, you find 84 individuals that can detoxify and 16 that cannot. The total number of alleles in the gene pool of this population is [blank1] and the frequency of the recessive allele is [blank2]. Assuming that this population remains in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, the expected frequency of clams in the next generation that can detoxify the bacterial contaminants is [blank3]

Jamal attended the campus president's speech about tuition increases, while Mary listened to a podcast of the speech in her car. Later, Mary said she thought the president's words stated clearly that he opposed an increase in tuition. But Jamal said that the way the president avoided looking at students when he talked about tuition made it seem the president actually supported an increase in tuition. The difference in the messages Mary and Jamal received most likely resulted from the fact that

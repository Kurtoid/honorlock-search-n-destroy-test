Saint Augustine's City of God  Book XIV (Higgins/Solomon, 45-46).  Augustine: "[t]his lust asserts its power not only over the entire body, nor only externally, but also from within.  It convulses all of a man when the emotion in his mind combines and mingles with the carnal drive to produce a pleasure unsurpassed among those of the body.  The effect of this is an almost total eclipse of acumen and, as it were, sentinel alertness. "But surely any friend of wisdom and holy joys, who lives in wedlock but knows, as the Apostle [Paul] admonished (in I Thessalonians 4), 'how to possess his bodily vessel in holiness and honor, not in the disease of lust like the gentiles who do not know God,' would prefer, if he could to beget children without this kind of lust." What does Augustine conclude from this argument?

It is important to understand the extent and significance of polymicrobial infections, since treating an infection with a single antibiotic for an assumed causative organism may not adequately eliminate the infection.
Virulence refers to recovery from the disease.
(2 pts) We have the circuit shown here...  In this figure, some currents, EMF sources, and resistors take the following values   = 1.00 A,  = [E2].00 V,  = [E3].00 V,  = [R1].00 O,  = [R2].00 O,  = [R3].00 O, and  = [R4].00 O.  The currents are positive if in the direction indicated. The unknown  is positive if the polarity is as illustrated here. Negative values are fine, they just indicate that the pictured current is the wrong way or the pictured EMF has a different polarity. You won't calculate this initially, but give your value for  here in units of mA. Be sure to include the sign if appropriate.

A patient with celiac disease understands his dietary restriction when he states:
Cement and reinforcing steel rebars are essential materials for constructing a reinforced concrete building. At a given location, the probability of shortage of cement and rebars are 0.1 and 0.05, respectively. However, if cement is not available, the probability of shortage of rebars is increased to 0.2. Consider the following two events:                 C: cement not available (shortage of cement)                 S: steel rebars not available (shortage of rebars) a) What is the probability that both cement and rebars are not available? b) What is the probability that there will be shortage of either of construction material? c) If rebars or cement are not available, what is the probability of shortage of both materials?

Follow the instruction below to answer this question: 1. Copy the graph below to your answer sheet.   2. Use your best artistic skill and draw the energy band diagram for a pnp transistor with VBE = 0.3 V and VBC = 2 V.  Use the collector as the electric ground.  Quantify the energy the quasi-Fermi level difference between the emitter and the base, as well as the quasi-Fermi-level difference between the base and the collector.  Your plot should reflect the feature of the quasi-neutral region in each section of the transistor. Random drawing or erroneous QFL assignments will receive zero credit. 3.

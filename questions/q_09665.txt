A refinery blends three petroleum components to produce two grades of gasoline - regular, and premium.  The maximum quantities available for each component and the cost per barrel are shown below     Component   Availability (barrels per day)   Cost per barrel     1   5,000   $9.00     2   2,400   $13.00     3   5,000   $10.00        To ensure that each grade of gasoline retains essential characteristics, the refinery has put limits on the percentage of the components in each.  The limits as well as the selling price for each grade of gas is shown below. (So, for instance, the first line in the table says that premium gas must consist of not more than 30% component 1 and a barrel of premium gas sells for $21 per barrel.)       Grade   Component Specifications   Selling Price per barrel     premium   Not more than 30% of component 1     $21     regular   Not less than 40% of component 3     $15       The refinery wants to produce at least 6000 barrels of each grade of gasoline. Formulate an LP to determine the optimal blend of components that will maximize profits. (25 points)

Two large conducting parallel plates A and B are separated by 2.4 m. A uniform field of 1500 V/m, in the positive x -direction, is produced by charges on the plates. The center plane at x = 0.00 m is an equipotential surface on which V = 0. An electron is projected from x = 0.00 m, with an initial velocity of 1.0 x 107 m/s perpendicular to the plates in the positive x -direction, as shown in the figure. What is the kinetic energy of the electron as it reaches plate A ? ( e = 1.60 x 10-19 C, m el = 9.11 x 10-31kg)

Which of these chains is polyunsaturated?

A researcher wishes to see whether there is a relationship between the caloric contents and the sodium contents (in milligrams) of 10 beef hot dogs.  She selects five brands of hot dogs, determined the caloric contents and the sodium contents (in milligrams) of each brand.  The data is listed in the table below.      Caloric Content, x Sodium content (mg)   150 370   170 480   120 340   120 360   90 300    Compute the value of the correlation coefficient (you may use your calculator).  Round the value to 4 decimal places.  Test the correlation coefficient for significance. Be sure to include your null and alternative hypotheses (including symbols - use the insert equation editor to do so),   If using the t-test: your t-critical value, your calculated t-test statistic, decision rule, decision, and conclusion.  The level of significance alpha, a = 0.05. If testing using table I, the statistically significant/critical value correlation coefficient, your calculated correlation coefficient, decision rule, decision, and conclusion.  The level of significance alpha, a = 0.05.   If applicable, find & interpret the coefficient of determination, R2. If applicable, find the linear regression equation. If not applicable, explain why it is not. If applicable, find the predicted sodium content if the caloric content is 160 calories. If not applicable, explain why it is not. If applicable, find the predicted sodium content if the caloric content is 200 calories. If not applicable, explain why it is not.  You must show all work for this problem.  If using a graphing calculator all computer output and explanations are required.  Failure to show your work or to provide an appropriate explanation will result in a 0 for the question's score regardless of whether or not the answer is correct.
What is the pattern of organization for the following passage? In the early years of the new nation, two types of newspapers were developing.   One was the mercantile paper, published in the seaboard towns primarily for the trading and shipping classes interested in commercial and political news.  Its well-filled advertising columns reflected the essentially business interests of its limited clientele of subscribers--2000 was a good number.  The other type was the political paper, partisan in its appeal and relying for reader support on acceptance of its views, rather than upon the quality and completeness of its news.  Most editors of the period put views first and news second, the political paper deliberately shaped the news to fit its views.

Suppose scores on exams in statistics are normally distributed with an unknown population mean and a population standard deviation of 4 points.   A random sample of 38 scores is taken and gives a sample mean score of 72. Find a confidence interval estimate for the population mean exam score (the mean score on all exams).    Find a 90% confidence interval for the true (population) mean of statistics exam scores.

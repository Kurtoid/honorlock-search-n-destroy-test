39)  Marco is a psychologist interested in people's ability to estimate crowd sizes.  Marco recruits a random sample of 1000 undergraduate students and shows them a photograph of Camp Randall (the University of Wisconsin-Madison's football stadium) during the Badger football team's game in 2019 against Michigan State (when the stadium was completely full).   Marco then randomly divides the participants into two groups and asks them slightly different questions:   Group #1:  Question 1: "Was the attendance at the football game in the picture greater than 100 people?"   Question 2: "What do you think the attendance at the football game was?"   Group #2:  Question 1: "Was the attendance at the football game in the picture greater than 100,000,000 people?"   Question 2: "What do you think the attendance at the football game was?"   When Marco compares the groups' responses to Question 2, Marco finds that the participants in Group #1 estimated that there were 70,000 people at the football game, while the participants in Group #2 estimated that there were 90,000 people at the football game.

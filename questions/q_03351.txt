Your patient is a five-year-old boy who appears to be dehydrated after having the flu. Which of the following is the best way to communicate with the patient regarding the need for obtaining IV access?
Define standard of care.
Problem 3 We have focused on the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply framework for thinking about short-term changes in the macroeconomy. The news extract in this box appeared in the Washington Post in January 2018. Let's analyze it!  Assume that, initially, the economy was in long-run equilibrium, that is, YE (equilibrium real GDP) was equal to YP (potential Real GDP). a) What are the main components of Aggregate Demand? b)  In December 2018, the Senate adopted the tax reform which translated into across-the-board cuts in income taxes. Once President Trump's budget was adopted, what would be the overall effects on each of the following: Transfer payments (TR), Government purchases of goods and services (G), taxes (T)? What is the impact on disposable income at the current level of real GDP? (No numbers needed. Just explain if they fall, rise or stay the same and state any additional assumptions you may make) c)  How would this situation affect the equilibrium real GDP and price level? Please refer to the graphs above to represent the change (if any) in the macroeconomy and discuss the change (if any). Would that benefit or harm the economy? d) Opponents to the adopted budget who fear an increase in government deficit suggested that, instead of reducing taxes, the Senate should actually increase taxes by the same exact amount as the overall increase in Government spending. Using the appropriate multipliers, explain whether this balanced approach would increase, reduce, or leave real GDP unchanged.

When 1.365 g of anthracene, C14H10, is combusted in a bomb calorimeter that has a water jacket containing 500.0 g of water, the temperature of the water increases by 25.89degC. Assuming that the specific heat of water is 4.18 J/(g degC), and that the heat absorption by the calorimeter is negligible, estimate the enthalpy of combustion per mole of anthracene.

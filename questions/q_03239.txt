In 1944, a well-intentioned individual introduced 29 reindeer to St. Matthew Island off the coast of Alaska. David Klein, an ecologist, visited the island in 1957 and found 1,350 well-fed reindeer munching on lichens.  In 1963, Klein returned to the island and counted 6,000 reindeer.  The population had soared far above the island's carrying capacity.  Lichens had become sparser and the average body size of the reindeer had decreased. In 1963--1964, the island went through an unusually harsh winter with extremely low temperatures and excessive amounts of snow. When Klein returned again in 1966, bleached-out reindeer bones littered the island and only 42 reindeer were alive.  Only one was a male; it had abnormal antlers, which made it unlikely to reproduce.  There were no fawns (baby deer).  By 1980, there were no reindeer on St. Matthew Island.

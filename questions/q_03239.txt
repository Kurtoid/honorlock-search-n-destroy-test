Suppose the dependent variable in a study is the number of times that children hit each other on the playground. That is, each time a child hits someone, the observer puts a tally mark on the observation sheet next to the child's name. Each child's score on this variable is the number of tallies next to his/her name. Most children scored "0" on this variable-they did not hit anyone. However, one child scored 2 (2 hits), and another child gave twice as many hits-he scored 4. A few children got even higher scores. This variable is considered to be a/an ________ scale.

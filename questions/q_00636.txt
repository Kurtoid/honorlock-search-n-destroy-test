Explain the difference between performing simple "what-if" analysis and using the Goal Seek tool using the worksheet shown in Figure 3 below. Assume that a formula is used in cell B6 to calculate the amount financed and that the PMT function is used in cell B10 to calculate the payment amount.  Both use references to the input values in column B.  Figure 3 a. Simple What-if Analysis:Assuming the formulas/functions correctly use cell references, state which input cell(s) a user would enter new value(s) in and which cell(s) would be automatically recalculated by the Excel program to produce new results. Use CELL REFERENCES to the cells in Figure 3 to cite SPECIFIC CELLS in your answer.   b. Goal Seek Analysis:To perform Goal Seek analysis for Figure 3 give the values that would be entered for Goal Seek's three arguments: Set cell:_______, To value:__________, and By changing value______Use cell references where appropriate in your answers.  Also answer the follow questions regarding Goal Seek:i)  How many input values may be changed at one time?ii)  Which cell must contain a formula or function? Begin each of your answers by typing a title line as shown below: a. Simple What-If Analysis: b. Goal Seek Analysis:

Design the Thevenin Equivalent circuit for the complex circuit shown below.  Your answer must correctly demonstrate each step of the process for designing a Thevenin equivalent circuit.  To complete this problem:  You may use scratch paper if you like, but all of your work, including all calculations, must be typed into the answer box below.    Your steps should be clearly labeled, and thoroughly explain what you are trying to calculate - and how. Your final answer should also include a description of what the Thevenin equivalent circuit should look like.  Explain the source, resistance(s), and orientation of the circuit. In other words, explain how you would wire the Thevenin equivalent circuit.   Use the "Insert Math Equation" function.  Answers without an adequate explanation or work/calculations will receive little to no points.

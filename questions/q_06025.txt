A BCBA was recruited to work with a young boy who climbed on top of all the furniture at his home. The BCBA trained the young boy's mother on the following procedure. When the boy climbs on top of any piece of furniture, immediately pull him down. Tell him, "No climbing" and gently lead him to the chair at the corner of the room with the booster seat attached and sit him in the chair for 2 min. Do not talk to or look at him while he is sitting in the chair. Do not allow his siblings or others to interact with him. Also, turn off the television while he is in the chair. When 2 minutes have passed, the child may get up from the chair and resume his previous activities. The boy's rate of furniture climbing decreased shortly after his mother began implementing the procedure. This procedure most closely exemplifies

Steam at 600lbf/in.2, 1000degF, enters a turbine operating at steady state with mass flow rate at 2000lb/min. Some steam is extracted from the turbine through a duct with a duct with a cross-sectional area of 1.6 ft2.  The pressure of the extracted steam is 100 lbf/in.2 and the velocity is 25.9 ft./s.  The rest of the steam exits as a two-phase liquid-vapor mixture with a temperature of 50degF,  a quality of 80%, and a volumetric flow rate of 36,350 ft3/s.  Kinetic and potential energy effects and heat transfer between the turbine and its surroundings are negligible.  Determine  A. Find the volumetric flow rate of the incoming steam, in ft3/min. B. Find the temperature of the extracted steam, in degF.  C. Write the 1st law and indicating any assumptions find the power produced by the turbine, in Btu/h.

Part 2. The following 12 short essay questions are designed to evaluate critical thinking/reasoning skills.  You do not need to answer all of the questions.  What you need to do is choose 2 the following questions to answer (correctly number which questions you chose). If you answer more than two questions, only the first two will be graded. (5 pts. each)  1) Explain what ecosystem diversity is and why environments with higher ecosystem diversity are healthier and able to resist negative effects.  2) What is the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning.  Give one example how you would use each type of reasoning.  3) What does the 2nd law of thermodynamics state about energy?  Why is this important to understand in regards to how energy moves through ecosystems?  4) What is the difference between a positive feedback loop and a negative feedback loop?  Provide a real-world example of either a positive or a negative feedback loop and how you know it is either a positive or negative feedback loop.  5) In regards to how energy flows through an ecosystem, specifically from producers to tertiary consumers, explain why it is so important to maintain the 'bottom' of the trophic pyramid (e.g., Eltonian Pyramid). 6) Explain what the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis is and why this hypothesis makes sense in regards to biodiversity in ecosystems.  7) Explain what is meant by altitudinal biomes (e.g., elevation) and how those biomes relate to the latitudinal (e.g., north-south) biomes. 8) What abiotic factor influences the aquatic biomes the most? Why did you chose the abiotic factor that you did?  9) It is sometimes phrased that "natural selection works on the phenotype" (I even said this during class).  First, what is meant by the term phenotype?  Second, why does natural selection work against the phenotype? Third, how does this affect a species genotype.  10) It has been suggested by some scientists that we are on the brink of, or in the early stages of the 6th mass extinction.  What are some of the reasons why scientists are saying this?  What is your opinion on this concept (do not forget to discuss evidence you are using to support your own opinion)?  11) What is meant by the term keystone species?  Why is important to protect keystone species and what can happen when a keystone species is removed from an ecosystem?  12) What is the difference between primary and secondary succession?  Is it possible for secondary succession to occur without primary succession occurring first?  In regards to primary or secondary succession, when are invasive plants (e.g., non-native) more likely to invade an area and why?

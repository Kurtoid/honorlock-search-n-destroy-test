A hypothesis test procedure is applied to compare a treatment group and a control group.  The null hypothesis is that the two groups are equal in performance and the alternative is that the treatment group outperforms the control group. For the situation presented below. state whether it is an instance of a Type I error, a Type II error, power, or a correct decision for "accepting" the null hypothesis.  The "givens" (found in bold print) reflect the true state of affairs, or what is really true in the population. Given the treatment group outperforms the control group and the researcher concluded that the treatment group did not outperform the control group.
Optimization is a statistical process that finds the way to make a design, system, or decision as effective as possible, for example, finding the values of controllable variables that determine maximal productivity or minimal waste.

Bivariate data was collected from a random sample of college students, where the independent variable x is the number of hours per week the student spent working at a part-time job and the dependent variable y is the student's overall satisfaction with their college experience (measured on a 100-point scale). SPSS was used to create a scatter plot of the data and to construct a simple linear regression model. A portion of the SPSS output appears below.          Use the SPSS output to fill in the blanks:  From the SPSS output, the value of Pearson's correlation is [r1]. Based on this and the scatter plot, there appears to be [r2]. The P-value for the ANOVA test is P=.0004. Testing at the .05 level of significance, the sample evidence is [a1] to conclude that a linear correlation exists between x and y. The proportion of the variance in a student's overall satisfaction with college that can be explained by the time the student spends working at a part-time job is [a2]. Using the linear regression model, a student who spends 9 hours per week working at a part-time job is expected to have an overall satisfaction score of approximately [score]. Based on the linear regression model, an increase of one hour in the time a student spends working at a part-time job decreases the student's expected overall satisfaction score by [m] points.

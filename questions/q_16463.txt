A 6.00-kg ornament is held at rest by two light wires that form 30deg angles with the vertical, as shown in the figure. An external force of magnitude F acts vertically downward on the ornament. The tension exerted by each of the two wires is T. A free-body diagram, showing the four forces that act on the box, is shown in the figure. If the magnitude of force F is 410 N, what is the magnitude of the tension T?

Diabetes Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease Type 2 (T2D) and gestational diabetes (GDM) are considered metabolic disturbances. Analysis of the three types of diabetes identified 8,469 transcripts considered as informative, and the principal component analysis (PCA) of these gene is shown above. Based on this plot, would you conclude that transcriptional signature could identify each of the 3 diseases?  Specifically, explain which if any of the diseases would be identifiable by transcriptional profiling, and provide specific evidence for your argument.

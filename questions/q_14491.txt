Problem 2. This problem tests your ability of reading reliability plots and if you can correctly interpret software outputs. (40 points) a. Read the following lognormal probability plot. The three lines correspond to lifetime distribution plots from three different temperature, 85C, 100C and  125C. You need to specify which line (e.g., solid line, long broken line, or short broken line) is for which temperature. Please find the median lifetime at each stress level and calculate the acceleration factors at 100C and 125C, comparing to 85C. (10 points)    b. Use the acceleration factors calculated above, compute the activation energy of this product. If the use stress is 25C, what is the estimated median lifetime at the use stress? (10 points) c. Can we say the parameter

Heart pumps the blood to arteries to be distributed in a human body. If we model the arteries as a tube, the length of that tube will be around 150.00 cm (from heart to foot). Blood's velocity when it enters the arteries is at 30.0 cm/sec. The internal diameter of arteries is around 19.0 mm on average. The density of blood is 0.994 g/ml.  Plot an engineering diagram. In a standing person, what is the change in potential energy of the blood entering at the heart level and leaving at foot level (Epout - Epin)? Report your answer in BTU/hr? What is kinetic energy of the blood exiting the arteries (Ekout)? Report your answer in BTU/hr.

According to Sigmund Freud, our personality develops from a conflict between two forces: our biological aggressive and pleasure-seeking drives versus our internal (socialized) control over these drives. Our personality is the result of our efforts to balance these two competing forces. Freud suggested that we can understand this by imagining three interacting systems within our minds. He called them the id, ego, and superego. The job of the ego, or self, is to balance the aggressive/pleasure-seeking drives of the id with the moral control of the superego.

Given: Catalog and Widget types as shown, select the memory diagram that best represents the memory used by w in the printWidget function. To avoid a limitation in Canvas, array code below has an extra space before the index. typedef struct { char code[ 5]; int pages; } Catalog ; typedef struct { char item[ 15]; Catalog *cat; float price; } Widget ;  void printWidget(Widget *w) { printf( " item: %sn", [CODE1] ); printf( " cat: %s (%i pages)n", [CODE2] ); printf( "price: $%fn", [CODE3] ); }... Memory Symbol Key:  (a) is a contiguous block of memory that is named a  (b) is a pointer named b that contains the address to another memory location; the end of the arrow indicates the memory that is pointed to. (c) shows a larger contiguous block of memory where all items in the box are stored in a contiguous block of memory; it may have address (c) associated with its start address or be pointed to (d) shows a larger contiguous block of memory that includes a smaller block of contiguous memory that is located within the larger block; it may have address (d) associated with its start address or be pointed to

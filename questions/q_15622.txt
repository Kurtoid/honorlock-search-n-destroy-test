Given: Catalog and Widget types as shown, select the memory diagram that best represents the memory used by w in the printWidget function. To avoid a limitation in Canvas, array code below has an extra space before the index. typedef struct { char code[ 5]; int pages; } Catalog ; typedef struct { char item[ 15]; Catalog *cat; float price; } Widget ; void printWidget(Widget *w) { printf( " item: %sn", [CODE1] ); printf( " cat: %s (%i pages)n", [CODE2] ); printf( "price: $%fn", [CODE3] ); } ...  Memory Symbol Key:  (a) is a contiguous block of memory that is named a  (b) is a pointer named b that contains the address to another memory location; the end of the arrow indicates the memory that is pointed to. (c) shows a larger contiguous block of memory where all items in the box are stored in a contiguous block of memory; it may have address (c) associated with its start address or be pointed to  (d) shows a larger contiguous block of memory that includes a smaller block of contiguous memory that is located within the larger block; it may have address (d) associated with its start address or be pointed to

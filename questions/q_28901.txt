As a possible solution to the problem of natural evil in the context of the Free Will Defense to the Problem of Evil, Alvin Plantinga has suggested that natural evil might result from the free will actions of Satan and his demons.  Plantinga merely suggested Satan as a possibility, and made no attempt to argue that Satan does indeed control nature.  Plantinga's point was that the existence of natural evil does not automatically doom the Free Will Defense.  That being said, we do not have to accept just any possibility that is thrown out even if we can't totally rule it out.   A possibility that is seriously problematic wouldn't help the Free Will Defense much.  There are multiple problems with the Satan possibility, but one that stands out is that Satan in Christianity tends to mess with humans, not nature.  We could imagine a scenario where God prohibited Satan from directly interfering with humans (so no possessions, deals, temptations, etc.) and only allowed Satan dominion over nature.  However, there are indirect methods that Satan could use to mess with humanity.  Describe a scenario in which Satan could use nature to mess around with humanity.  Do you think there is any way for God to prevent Satan from messing with humanity by using nature without violating Satan's free will?  Explain your answer.

A wheel is shaped like a hoop, with all of the mass on the outer edge (like a bicycle wheel).  The spokes that hold the wheel to the axis at the center and the wheel hub have negligible mass.  The mass of the outer edge is m = 30 kg, and the radius is r = 5.0 m.  A cord is attached to a hub that is rhub = 2.0 m from the axis.  Force F = 700 N pulls on the wheel at the hub as shown.  The axis is fixed so that it rotates, but does not translate.  Assume no friction.  a)  Find the angular acceleration of the wheel. b)  Find the magnitude of the tangential acceleration of a point on the outer edge of the wheel.

4 pages double spaced (1200 words) A patient underwent a complex and rare surgery  which resulted in complications including permanent paralysis.  The doctor that performed the surgery did not think he did anything improper and that the outcome was a normal risk of the procedure. Regardless, he only had a policy with a limits of $1,000,000 and was concerned about a personal exposure due to the extent of the injuries suffered by the patient.  Unlike many professional liability policies, his policy gave full control of  all settlement decision to the insurance company.   The patient hired an attorney who filed suit and  submitted a policy limit demand letter.  The  adjuster recognized that while liability was generally favorable to the insured doctor, a significant injury was sustained by the patient.  He noted that if liability were established,  a verdict could be well in excess of the policy limit in his file notes.   Counsel was retained and represented the insured, doctor, but at the request of the adjuster, never offered an opinion on  strategy,  case value or the risks associated with the case.  The insurance company  never extended any offer and did not fully evaluate the damages because it was clear that if they lost on liability, the value of the case was in excess of the policy limit.  The  case went to trial and a verdict  of $3,000,000 was rendered.  The doctor then assigned his bad faith claim to the patient and suit was filed against the insurance company.  Did the insurance company  handle this case properly? Does the insurance company have any liability beyond the $1,000,000 policy limit.  Please explain your answer.

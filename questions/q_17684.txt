After reading the paragraph below, answer the questions that follow.Ron and Tiffany are studying circulatory system function. They designed an experiment to test whether the diameter of a tube affects the rate of flow through the tube. In their experiment, they ran water from a large container through five tubes with different diameters for exactly 30 seconds for each tube. They measured the volume of liquid that passed through the tube during the 30-second period, testing each tube three times and pouring the water back into the container after each test. The results of the experiment are shown in the following table.    Diameter of Tube (cm) Average Volume Fluid (mL)   Tube A 0.5 210   Tube B 0.6 350   Tube C 0.7 480   Tube D 0.8 600   Tube E 0.9 975   Which statement best summarizes the results of the experiment?

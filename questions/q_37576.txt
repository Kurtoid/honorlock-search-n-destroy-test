Complete the main method below so that it reads in a file named FileIn.txt (assume this exists in the same directory where you are running your program). The method should output each line to another file named FileOut.txt, replacing each EVEN line with "Line X was an even line", where X is the line number (starting with 1). Look closely at the example output for more clarification. Notice that the output file has the SAME number of lines as the input file. HINT: Store each line from the input file into a String variable BEFORE testing if it is an even or odd line number. import java.io.*;import java.util.Scanner;public class FileIO {  public static void main(String[] args) { /* Your implementation here */ }} Example input and output files:     FileIn.txt   FileOut.txt     Here is  some texteven more   HereLine 2 was an even linesome textLine 4 was an even line       Make sure to select the 'Preformatted' style from the dropdown so your code is formatted clearly.

Consider the following payoff table where d1,d2, and d3 represent the available decisions and s1, s2 and s3 represent the possible states of nature.  The numbers in the table represent profits.           s1   s2   s3     d1   3000   1000   1500     d2   1000   1200   1400     d3   5000   500   1200       Assume that we have no information about the probabilities of the states of nature, s1,s2,s3.  Use the Maximax approach to choose a decision Use the Maximin approach to choose a decision. Assume now that we have probability estimates for these states as follows p(s1) = .4, p(s2)  = .3, p(s3) = .3  Using the expected value approach, which decision should be chosen? What is the Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) for this problem?

Balancing Redox Reactions using the Half-Reaction Method 1. Write the two half-reactions representing the redox process 2. Balance all elements except oxygen and hydrogen 3. Balance Oxygen atoms by adding H2O molecules 4. Balance hydrogen atoms by adding H+ ions 5. Balance charge by adding electrons (e-) 6. If necessary, multiply each half-reaction's coefficients by the smallest possible integers to yield equal numbers of electrons in each 7. Add the balanced half-reactions together and simplify by removing species that appear on both sides of the equation 8. Check that both the numbers of atoms and total charges are balanced

The rating is to be determined for the heat exchanger illustrated in the sketch.  The conductance, UA, is 14,400 Btu/hr[?]oF.  The conditions are as follows: T_inlet, hot = 350 F; T_inlet,cold = 150 F mdot_hot = 8.334 lbm/s; mdot_cold = 4 lbm/s cp_hot = 0.24 BTU/lbm-R; cp_cold = 1.00 Btu/lbm-R   The maximum heat transfer is: (Express your answer as numerical only no units.  The magnitude corresponding to units of Btu/s should be used.)

Attraction Corporation produces specially machined parts. The parts are produced in batches in one continuous manufacturing process. Each part is custom produced and requires special engineering design activity (based on customer specifications). Once the design is completed, the equipment can be set up for batch production. Once the batch is completed, a sample is taken and inspected to see if the parts are within the tolerances allowed. Thus, the manufacturing process has four activities: engineering, setups, machining, and inspecting. In addition, there is a sustaining process with two activities: providing utilities (plantwide) and providing space. Costs have been assigned to each activity using direct tracing and resource drivers:       Engineering     $1,000,000       Setups     900,000       Machining     2,000,000       Inspection     800,000       Providing space     250,000       Providing utilities     180,000       Activity drivers for each activity have been identified and their practical capacities listed:       Machine hours     25,000       Setups     200       Engineering hours     5,000       Inspection hours     2,500         The costs of facility-level activities are assigned using machine hours.    What is (are) the unit-level activity(ies)?

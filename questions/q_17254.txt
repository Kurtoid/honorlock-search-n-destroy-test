Mack was badly abused as a child. His father was an alcoholic, and Mack vividly remembers the sequence of events. His father would walk in the door at 10 pm, smelling of alcohol. He would slam the door shut, he would stomp across the floor, take off his belt, and whip young, terrified Mack with it. Eventually, Mack decided to run away. He packed up his belongings and left.

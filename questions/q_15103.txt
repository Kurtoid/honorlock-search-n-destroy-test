A fully ionized Potassium atom (19 protons, 20 neutrons) with an initial velocity of -925 i km/s moves into an area where there is a static electric field of +875 j kV/m.  Calculate the magnitude and direction (relative to 0deg = +i direction) of the ion's momentum       exactly 43.7 ns after it enters the electric field.   2. Calculate the work done by the electric field during this same 43.7 ns.

Carnosine (shown below) is a dipeptide molecule made up of the amino acids b-alanine and histidine bound together through an amide bond. It is highly concentrated in muscle and brain tissues and has been proven to scavenge reactive oxygen species, among other things.  Consider the different conformations of carnosine through the C2-C3 bond and answer the following questions. Which of the Newman structures below represents the conformation wherein the dihedral angle between the "Im" group and the "NH(b-Ala)" group is 180deg? [180deg] Which of the Newman structures below represents the conformation wherein the dihedral angle between the "Im" group and the "NH(b-Ala)" group is 0deg? [0deg] Which Newman structure of carnosine (through the C2-C3 bond) shown below shows the molecule in its lowest energy conformation (assume "NH(b-Ala)" is larger than CO2H)? [lowestE] Which Newman structure of carnosine (through the C2-C3 bond) shown below shows the molecule in its highest energy conformation (assume "NH(b-Ala)" is larger than CO2H)? [highestE] What is the relationship between structures C and F below? [relationship]

Read the following scenario and answer the questions accordingly (there are 4 questions for this specific scenario). Toward the end of the ski season, you decide to take one last trip. You go to resort, and there are not a lot of people on the mountain. You take advantage and begin to go skiing. As you ski down the mountain on a run with trees bordering on both sides, you come across a man lying motionless in the snow near a tree that he may have crashed into. No other skiers are in sight and you are alone. As you approach the person, you see no obvious injuries. You have no first aid supplies. Your first aid certification is current. 3. True or False - After tapping on the man's shoulder to see if he is okay, he remains unresponsive but is breathing. You can leave and assume that ski patrol will be coming shortly.

Assume that if Wayne Enterprises decided to discontinue product X43 a $30,000 operating loss would occur. What volume of units (i.e., number of units produced and sold) would make Wayne Enterprises indifferent between discontinuing product X43 and continuing it given the revenue and cost data above? Please round your response to the nearest whole number (e.g., 15,434.66666 would be 15,435).

[For this and other calculation questions, I strongly suggest typing out your math for any chance of partial credit...an answer like 'about 100' will  earn a zero] Recall the Purification Table for Carbonic Anhydrase (MW = 32,000 g/mole) in that paper where 2.5 grams of protein was used as starting material, and 40 micrograms of purified enzyme was obtained with a 22% yield or total recovery.   a) If the investigator obtains 1.0 gram of cell material (80% water by weight; however, as noted in your textbook an average protein is 40% water by weight) from 1.0 L of cell culture, how many liters of cell culture did this investigator start with? (Remember the percentage of protein by weight in the cell discussed in class was completely DRY weight).   b) If the cells were harvested at a cell density of 2 x 109 cells/ml, how many molecules of carbonic anhydrase are estimated to be present in each cell of the culture?

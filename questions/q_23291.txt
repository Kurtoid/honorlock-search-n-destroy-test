*Please Note, The first two parts of answers are answered in this question, the remainder is in the subsequent question* Live Ranges In the following instruction sequence, identify (a) dead register and (b) unused register indicating their ranges. A dead register is the one that carries a value which has no further use. An unused register on the other hand, carries a live value which has a use further down in its live range but has no use in a given range.    Write your answer using the format: register#{starting-label, ending-label}. For example, if register r6 is dead between labels 10 to 15, the answer will be r6{10, 15}. The ranges are inclusive of the labels, ie, this range starts at 10 and ends at 15 both being included in the range.   You will identify the answer to (a) and (b) as the registers with the longest ranges - ie, report above only one dead register with a longest range and one unused register over a longest range along with their respective ranges.   Spill Code Next, our goal is to remove the spill code shown in instructions 4 through 6  and 8 and 9 below.  c) Which register will you use for removing this spill for the best code efficiency. Justify your answer.  d) Finally show the modified code with spill removed by using this register.  Make sure you ensure code correctness by inserting necessary boundary load/stores if necessary.     // Note:  r1 and r2 already have some existing values which are going to be used in the following code excerpt //   add r3, r1, r2  mul r2, r1, r1  add r4, r1, r1  ldw s1, mem{4}  // spill code - spilled value is loaded  addi s1, s1, 10   // some operation on spilled value  stw s1, mem{4}   // spilled value is stored back  sub r4, r1, r1  ldw s2, mem{4} // spilled value loaded  add  r5, s2, 2     // spilled value used  ldw r2, mem{r1}  add r4, r3, r2  add r5, r5, 1  mul r3, r2, r1  div r3, r3, r1  mul r5, r5, 3  add r2, r3, r4  stw r2, mem{r1}  // Note : the values in r5 and r2 are live below this point// The instruction format is OP DEST, SRC1, SRC2 for all operations, except for load and store which have the format OP DEST, SRC, where the DEST represents the destination (target) of the instruction and SRC indicates the source.

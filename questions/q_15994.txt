A two-stage, high-rate trickling filters treat 2.25 MGD of municipal wastewater that has a BOD5 of 210 mg/L. The trickling filters are of equal diameter and depth and have equal recycle ratios. Other pertinent data for the facility are as follows:  BOD5 applied to the trickling filter system: 158 mg/L after 25% of BOD5 removal in the primary clarification system Trickling filter diameter: 75 ft Trickling filter media depth: 6ft Required surface area of the two-stage trickling filter system: 4,418 ft2 (=0.1014 acres) Recycle ratio: 1.0  Using the NRC equations, determine the following parameters and solve the problems.    (5 pts) Determine the required volume of the two-stage trickling filter system (Unit: acreft). (5 pts) Determine organic mass loading to the two-stage trickling filter system (unit: lb BOD5/day). (5 pts) Determine trickling filter recycle factor (F). (5 pts) If the BOD5 removal efficiency of the first-stage trickling filter is 68.4%, determine BOD5 removal efficiency (%) of the second-stage trickling filter. (Hint: V2 unit is acreft)

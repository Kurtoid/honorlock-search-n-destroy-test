QUESTION 4     4.1   Read Extract 1 below and answer the questions set.                   Extract 1: NHS funding     The National Health Service (NHS) is the largest employer in Europe with more than 1.3 million staff. It treats over 1 million patients every 36 hours. Between 1997 and 2008 government spending on the NHS increased in real terms from PS58.5 billion to PS115 billion and accounted for 8.3 per cent of GDP. Spending is planned to increase further to PS127 billion by 2011. This reflects growing demand and cost pressures on the health care budget, following an ageing population, advances in medical care and rising staff costs. Staff wages now account for 40 per cent of the NHS budget.   However, the huge increases in NHS funding are set to come to an end after 2011 as government spending must be reduced following the impact of the recession. The government has identified ways to increase NHS efficiency by driving down the prices for goods and services it buys, reducing staff sickness, cutting its investment in computer software, improving the use of its buildings and lowering its energy consumption. Some progress has already been made as the average length of inpatient stay in hospital has fallen from 8.8 days to 6.3 days between 1997 and 2008. Source: adapted from: www.kingsFund.org.uk             4.1.1   Using examples, explain the significance of opportunity cost to the increase in government spending on the NHS referred to in Extract 1.

A college student gained weight over the course of his first semester of college. His mother was concerned for his health, so over winter break, she told him that if he joined an on-campus gym and started an exercise routine she would pay the gym's membership fees, and that she would also pay him $100 for every pound he lost until he returned to a healthy weight. The college student agreed and said he would sign up when he returned to campus. The next day, the college student left his mother's house to spend the remainder of his winter break at his father's house. His father also was concerned about his son's recent weight gain. The college student told his father of his mother's offer. His father thought it was a great idea and told the college student that if his mother didn't pay as promised, he would pay. The next semester the college student joined the gym and as a result of his efforts he managed to lose 30 pounds. Shortly before summer break began, the student's mother died, and his step-father, who was the executor of the mother's estate, cancelled the gym membership and refused to pay the college student any money for his weight loss. When the college student told his father what had happened, his father also refused to pay, saying that the student should be satisfied with his weight loss and not concerned with the payment. If the college student brings suit against his father for breach of contract, which of the following represents his father's best defense?

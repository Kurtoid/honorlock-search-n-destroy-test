You may be asked to create a k-map during the exam.  You can create a digital k-map by inserting a table into your answer box, similar to the one below.   Here is an example k-map for a circuit with four inputs A1, A2, A3, and A4 where A4 is the MSB.  K-Map     A2'  A1' 0   0   A2'  A1 0   1   A2  A1 1  1   A2  A1' 1   0     A4' A3' 0    0  0 0 0 0    A4' A3 0    1  0 1 1 0    A4 A3 1  1  1 1 x 0    A4 A3' 1   0  X 1 1 0    You do not have to show your circles when you answer the problem.  But you do have to use circling to figure out the simplified output expression of the circuit.  You may wish to also draw the k-map on your own paper and draw the circles so that you can determine the output expression. Practice drawing a k-map in the space below.   Determine the expression for the output of the circuit and type it below your k-map. Be sure that you can create a k-map within Canvas during an online exam.  Exam time won't be changed or extended due to an inability to create a k-map within your answer box.  Be sure you can draw a k-map for 3 or 4 variables.

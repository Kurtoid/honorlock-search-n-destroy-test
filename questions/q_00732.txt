Two masses hang from a fixed pulley.   The masses are m1 = 10 kg and m2 = 40 kg.  The pulley has moment of inertial I3 = 6.0 kg*m2 and radius r = 0.80 m.  Initially, the system is moving such that the masses have a speed of 5.0 m/s (mass 2 is moving down). a)  Find the total initial Kinetic energy of the system (both masses and pulley) b)  Find the total final Kinetic energy of the system after mass 2 has moved downward a distance of 2.0 m (note mass 1 moves up 2.0 m).

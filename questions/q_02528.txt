You are a research assistant in a lab that studies nucleic acids. Your advisor gave you four tubes for analysis. Each of these tubes differs in its contents by the source of its nucleic acids: mouse cytoplasm (single-stranded RNA), yeast nuclei (double-stranded DNA), rotavirus (double-stranded RNA), and parvovirus (single-stranded DNA). The approximate nucleotide base composition of each sample is given in the table below.

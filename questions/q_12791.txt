Consider in this question and the following questions a real elastic solid (not to be confused with the fluid solid described previously in this class). Reversible work can be done on this system only by shearing it. In this case, the amount of reversible work done d W_r by a small change in the strain, d e, is s d e, where s is the stress. Write down the fundamental equation for such a system and use it to derive two equations of state and a Maxwell relation.

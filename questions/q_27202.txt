Dwayne and his buddy Sea Bass are over-the-road truckers, and at their weekly chess match on Sundays, they compare the number of miles they drove during the week. The data for last week are illustrated by the bar graph. Who drove further during the first three days (Monday through Wednesday).
Consider the symmetric I-beam below. Recall that the flanges are the two primarily horizontal segments of the beam, and the web is the primarily vertical section. The beam is loaded in such a way that both shear V and moment M are non-zero. Which of the statements below is the most accurate about the general nature of the shear and normal stresses in the beam?
Using the graph, determine any relative maxima and relative minima of the function.f(x) = x3 - 12x + 2
This model is exceptionally good at modeling fraction multiplication. It works when partitioning is challenging and provides a visual of the size of the result.
What volume of a 2.00 M KCl solution should you use to make 500. mL of a 0.100 M KCl solution?
Jarrod was an active man who was extremely interested in physical fitness.  Running, going to the gym, and being outdoors were a major part of Jarrod's life.  When Jarrod became unable to complete a run or his weight exercises, he became worried.  He was experiencing muscle weakness and fatigue more and more frequently in his daily life.  Where Jarrod had once been able to go to the gym three days a week for weight training and lift one hundred sixty pounds, he was now lucky to lift seventy-five pounds for just one full repetition before his muscles were no longer able to continue.     His doctor told him he had an autoimmune disorder called Myasthenia gravis where the body's immune system attacks the skeletal muscle cells, making them respond slower to the nervous system and present weaker contractions.  Jarrod didn't understand what any of that meant so the doctor proceeded to explain to him the importance of the nerves and muscles working together.   The neuromuscular junction is an important communication point in the human body.  This junction illustrates how the nervous system and the muscular system use electric and chemical signals to communicate.  This communication allows for our conscious control of skeletal muscles, so it's vital to our daily functions.   For this junction to work we must first produce an action potential in a motor neuron.  This action potential will propagate down an axon and cause voltage-gated calcium channels to open.  The calcium ion will enter the presynaptic terminal and initiate the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  The acetylcholine will be released by exocytosis and diffuse across the synapse and bind to ligand-gated sodium channels on the postsynaptic membrane (skeletal muscle).  This will cause the ligand-gated sodium channels to open and allow sodium to enter the cell membrane of the skeletal muscle.  Once threshold is passed, an action potential is generated along the cell membrane of the skeletal muscle.  Muscle contraction will occur soon after.   For the muscle to relax, acetylcholine must be removed from the sodium channels by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.  This will break down the acetylcholine into acetic acid and choline.  The choline will be transported back into the terminal end of the axon and the acetic acid diffuses away from the synapse.   The doctor proceeded to explain that in individuals with Myasthenia gravis, the person's immune system attacks and destroys the ligand-gated sodium channels on the postsynaptic membrane of the skeletal muscle cell.  With fewer ligand-gated sodium channels, it takes longer for the threshold to be met to generate an action potential and weakens the contraction strength of the muscle.    Jarrod was shocked to learn that it was his own body that had caused the disease and to also learn that his condition was incurable.  His doctor informed him that he could use corticosteroids and immunosuppressant medicines to prevent any further attacks, but the current damage was permanent.  Jarrod would be unable to continue living as physically active as he had previously been, but in time he would learn the extent of his physical capabilities and slowly define a new normal for his life. This figure is associated with the text above and to answers to questions below.      What ion channels must be opened on the post-synaptic membrane of a skeletal muscle to initiate a muscle contraction?
Instructions: Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.        (1) Street skateboarding and vert skateboarding differ in several ways. (2) Street skateboarding takes place in outdoor public areas where there are staircases, benches, walls, and sidewalks. (3) In contrast, vert skateboarding usually takes place in skate parks with ramps or bowls. (4) Another major difference is the tricks performed in each type of skateboarding. (5) Street skaters use a style called the grind, which involves scraping their boards' axles against objects such as stairway handrails. (6) They also perform tricks that involve kicking the board to flip it into the air. (7) Vert skaters, on the other hand, use the steep walls of the ramps or bowls to pick up speed and gain "air time" at the edges. (8) While airborne, they perform different flips and spins. (9) To achieve these tricks, they use boards that are wider and flatter than street boards, which have upturned noses and tails to aid kicking.   Which of the following sentences does NOT contain a transitional expression that indicates contrast or comparison?

Some researchers believe there is an association between daily sodium intake and blood pressure level. Imagine we collect information on the amount of sodium intake yesterday and blood pressure of 300 middle-age men in Austin, Taxes. We hypothesize that middle-age men who consumed less sodium would have lower blood pressure. Which kind of graph can the best portray this relationship:

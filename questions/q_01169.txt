A 10-month-old girl developed a cough and sore throat.  She lives in rural Iowa on a farm.  Her mother decided to treat the cold homeopathically by giving her fresh honey from their farm.  The next morning her arms were limp and she was not responding to interactions.  They rushed her to the emergency room.   The most likely pathogen:
Boundaries offer unique habitats
Question 2 (25 points): Composites   A research team has invented a new composite manufacturing process that can create ceramic-ceramic composites. In this type of composite, ceramic fibers of uniform diameter (d) are all aligned along the same direction within a ceramic matrix. The process can generate composite samples of only a constant fiber volume fraction (50%) but the diameter of the fibers can be varied from 4 um to 16 um. Note that the diameter (d) of all fibers inside the same composite sample is uniform (i.e., equal) but many different samples can be fabricated by changing the diameter of the fibers. The properties of the materials are listed below. The Young's modulus of the fiber increases with decreasing diameter. sqrt () is the square root operator.       Material   Density (g/cm3)   Young's modulus (GPa)     Ceramic fiber   4   200 x sqrt (100 um / d [in um])     Ceramic matrix   4   200       Answer the following questions. Show your work and provide justifications. (a) What would be the density of the densest composite sample? (6 pt) (b) What would be the density of the lightest composite sample? (6 pt) (c) What would be the maximum Young's modulus for the densest composite? (6 pt) (d) What would be the minimum Young's modulus for the lightest composite? (7 pt)

Make sure to include proper notation - such as f'(x) - on all answers (where appropriate).  Remember, work MUST be shown for all problems - you should make sure each problem number on your work is properly labeled.  You MUST enter your final answer in Canvas, but you should show your work on your paper.  SCAN THE WORK WHILE STILL LOGGED IN TO HONORLOCK - UPLOAD IT AS SOON AS YOU DISCONNECT FROM HONORLOCK. To get credit for a problem, your answer in Canvas must 'match' the uploaded work.  No credit will be awarded for problems with no work shown (in Canvas or on paper, your choice).

100 mL of a solution with a TOC (total organic carbon) concentration of 0.5% is placed in each of the five containers with activated carbon and shaken for 48 hours. The samples are filtered and the concentration of TOC measured, yielding the following analyses: Test beaker no.:          1          2          3          4          5 Carbon (grams):          10        8          6          4          2 TOC (mg/L):               42        53        85        129      267   The Freundlich isotherm is to be used:  X/M = k Cf 1/n The value of X (TOC removed) in the 1st beaker is (mg):
Wild West produces two types of cowboy hats. A Type 1 hat requires twice as much labor time as a Type 2. If all the available labor time is dedicated to Type 2 alone, the company can produce a total of 400 Type 2 hats a day. The respective market limits for the two types are 150 and 200 hats per day. The profit is $8 per Type 1 hat and $5 per Type 2 hat.  Develop a mathematical model to determine the number of hats of each type that would maximize profit. Use Graphical approach to find the optimal solution.    Perform calculations on your paper and take a photo of your work.  Then, save the image as a response to your computer. Upload that file to this exam for credit.  Submission Steps: Browse computer > Choose file > Open

Q21-I (20 pts) On May 1, after planting, as a corn producer, you are planning to sell 200,000 bushels of corn after harvest. To protect against falling price from now to harvest, you are considering to implement the following strategies: (i) a short hedge using the DEC futures. In December, you will offset the futures position and sell the crop in the local cash market. (ii) two short hedges using the DEC and MAR futures. As expiration of the DEC contract approaches, you will roll your hedge forward, put the crop in storage for three months, and sell the crop in the local market in March. (Note that rolling the hedge means that in December you will offset the DEC futures position and put on a new short hedge using MAR futures, which will be offset in March)Answer the following questions using the futures prices listed below and assume that on May 1, the at-the-money put option is trading at $0.05/bushel.

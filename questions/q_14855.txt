Find the current for R5 of the circuit below.  You must perform a delta-to-wye or wye-to-delta conversion on a portion of this circuit. You must determine which portion to convert.  Complete the following steps to show your work.  It is required to organize your work clearly.  A.) State which resistors you have selected, and which type of conversion you are going to perform. B.) Enter your calculations for the conversion, using the "Insert Math Equation" tool.  C.) Write an explanation of all the resistor relationships in the new circuit.   For example, R1 is in parallel with R2.  That combination is in series with R3.  The following combination is in parallel with R4...etc.  D.) Calculate the total resistance of the new circuit.  Each step of your calculation must be shown. E.) Find the current for R5 of the original circuit.   Your work, including all calculations, must be typed into the answer box below.   Use the "Insert Math Equation" function.  Answers without an adequate explanation or work/calculations will receive little to no points.

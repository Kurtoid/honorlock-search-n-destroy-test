Two parallel disks are positioned coaxially in parallel with a distance of L=D=0.1m apart.  The lower disk diameter is D1=D and the upper disk diameter is D2=2D.  Both disks were oxidized with the emissivity of 0.6.  The lower disk is heated electrically to maintain a uniform temperature of 600K.  The upper disk can reach stable temperature of 400K.  Please calculate the energy transfer between disks. (you need to get the value)

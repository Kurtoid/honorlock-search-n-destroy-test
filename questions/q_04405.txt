It is late at night, and Miranda is walking to her car alone when she hears someone behind her. It is a man, and he seems to be following her. Miranda starts walking faster, but so does he. She starts to run, and he begins to run after her. When Miranda looks back, she sees that he is holding a knife. Fortunately, Miranda makes it to her car, jumps in, and locks the doors just before the man reaches her car. He tries to open her passenger-side front door and begins pounding on the window of that door, still holding the knife. Miranda gets a small pistol out of her glove box. She realizes that she could just drive away, but she is convinced that she is justified in shooting this dangerous man, and she lives in a "stand your ground" jurisdiction.

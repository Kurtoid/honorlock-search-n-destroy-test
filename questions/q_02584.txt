"Since 1930, the Brazilian government has been undertaking a social policy whose main goal is to protect the working classes through the betterment of their working conditions, elevating their standard of life and extending the social security system. Indeed, the 1937 constitution proclaims that work is a social duty and establishes that it is the government's responsibility to guarantee the fulfillment of this duty by securing favorable conditions for workers and protecting them. In this way, the constitution guarantees the right of organization, recognizes the current unions as representatives of the workers, and authorizes the signing of collective-bargaining agreements. Salaries are protected and must provide a minimum standard of life. The workday is eight hours long, and there is one mandatory day of rest. Paid vacations are mandatory. Workers are protected against unjustified dismissal. Minors under 14 years old are not allowed to work, and women and men under 18 years old cannot work in unhealthy sites. The constitution establishes that the state must provide medical assistance to workers, and it must protect maternity and create insurance against old age and disability. The constitution also compels professional associations to assist its members. In order to enforce these principles, the constitution anticipates the creation of a Work Tribunal whose goal will be to arbitrate in all work-related litigation." Document produced by the Brazilian government of Getulio Vargas circa 1940; Vargas had come to power in 1930 following a military coup. Which of the following best explains a potentially significant limitation of using the document for understanding the reforms described in the passage in Brazil?
In the pancreatic b cells, glucokinase (similar to liver enzyme, high Km, high Vmax) participates in the b cells functioning as a glucose sensor (these cells respond to high blood glucose levels by releasing insulin). Glucose, imported into the b cells by the GLUT2 transporter, is metabolized through the glycolytic pathway to produce ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. The ATP produced binds to an ATP-dependent K+ channel leading to depolarization of the b cells and insulin release. Since b cell glucokinase is similar to the liver glucokinase, which of the following characteristics of glucokinase will also contribute to glucose sensing by the b cells?

14. The tegmentum is located ____________ to the cerebral acqueduct and contains the _________.

Glycolysis is not the only metabolic pathway for glucose utilization.  This problem explores the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (shown below), named for its discoverers.  The net result of the pathway is that a molecule of glucose is converted to two molecules of CO2 plus two molecules of ethanol.  Note that the reactions from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to pyruvate are identical to those used in glycolysis.  Can glucose metabolism by the Entner-Doudoroff pathway proceed indefinitely in the absence of a functioning citric acid cycle (in other words, in the absence of oxygen)?
Which of the following is not found in cell membranes?

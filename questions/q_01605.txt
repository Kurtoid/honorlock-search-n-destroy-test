Write the solution (include all steps) to this problem on a piece of paper.  Once completed, hold the solution so I can see it on-camera for at least 3 seconds.  After you submit this exam, you will scan and submit the problems work as a single PDF document to the corresponding dropbox in eCampus for this exam.  The problems you submit to the dropbox must exactly match the problems shown on-camera.  If not, the grade for this exam will be a zero.  You may not use a calculator on this exam.

What enriched medium contains hemolyzed red blood cells, which allows for the release of X (hemin) and V (NAD) factors?  (1.35; 2.14)
Question 3 (20 marks)  What are the difference between the fatigue limit and tensile strength of a material? Explain the condition and criteria used for engineering design while considering the fatigue limit and tensile strength. (10 marks) A mild steel plate is subjected to a constant amplitude uniaxial fatigue loads to produce stress varying from smax = 180 MPa to smin = -40 MPa. The static properties of the steel are syield = 500 MPa, E=207 GPa, and KIc = 100 MPa m1/2. Fatigue crack growth rate data has been gathered for mild steel: the Paris law constant, c = 6.9 x 10-12 and the Paris law exponent, m = 3.  You can assume the shape factor Y = 1.2. If the plate contains an initial through thickness edge crack of 0.5 mm, how many fatigue cycles will be required to break the plate? (10 marks)

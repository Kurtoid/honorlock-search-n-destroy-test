You have been hired to evaluate an existing drainage system (10 years old). Find out whether the pipe diameter is adequate to handle the design discharge flow. What is your professional (practical) recommendation to make the drainage system more efficient? Show your recommendation mathematically through calculations; provide a solution to improve the current situation. Below, the existing drainage characteristics are listed:  Drainage coefficient (q): 6 mm/d (from a rainfall frequency distribution, maximum three day duration rainfall occurring once every four years), Lateral drain pipe length: 300 m, Lateral drain pipe spacing: 100 m, Lateral drain pipe diameter: 100 mm (4"), Lateral pipe type: corrugated plastic pipe (n = 0.0145), Hydraulic gradient: 0.1%,  Note: Assume steady-state flow conditions (i.e., uniform flow throughout the pipe length). Also, it is assumed that siltation has occurred and that the drainage discharge flow has been reduced by 25%. This is an evaluation case, not a design case.

The pedigree below maps the inheritance of a particular trait within a family. Based on this pedigree, what is the inheritance pattern of this trait? Justify your answer with scientific knowledge and reasoning. Shaded individuals indicate those affected by this trait. Note that carriers, if present, are not marked by this pedigree.  [Image ID: Three generation pedigree. Generation 1 Individual 1 (affected male) mates with Generation 1 Individual 2 (unaffected female). This mating produces Generation 2 Individual 2 (affected female) who mates with Generation 2 Individual 1 (unaffected male). They produce four offspring: Generation 3 Individual 1 (affected male), Generation 3 Individual 2 (unaffected female), Generation 3 Individual 3 (unaffected male), and Generation 3 Individual 4 (affected female).]

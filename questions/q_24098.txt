Le 1er mai Read the description below about the holiday celebrated in France on May 1st and answer the questions in English. Le 1er mai est considere comme la journee internationale des travailleurs ou la fete du Travail. A l'origine, cette journee etait un jour annuel de greve (strike) pour reduire (shorten) le temps de travail. A l'heure actuelle, elle est celebree dans de nombreux pays du monde mais il arrive parfois, comme c'est le cas en Amerique du Nord, qu'on la celebre a un autre moment de l'annee. Au debut du 20eme siecle, les Francais, les Suisses et les Belges ont pris l'habitude, a l'occasion du 1er mai, d'offrir aux amis et aux membres de la famille un petit bouquet de muguet (lily of the valley). Le muguet est le symbole du printemps et represente le retour de l'optimisme. Il est interessant de remarquer que l'administration fiscale autorise la vente du muguet aux travailleurs sans formalites ni taxes (without regulation or tax) le 1er mai. Dans le code du travail, le 1er mai est devenu un jour ferie et paye pour tous les salaries en 1947 mais c'est en avril 1948 qu'on adopte le nom officiel de <<fete du Travail>> en France. De nombreuses manifestations syndicales (trade union) sont organisees dans les grandes villes de France le 1er mai. What was the goal of the strike that is associated with this holiday?

Optimizing access performance under paging. Consider a paging system that uses page tables, TLB, and memory cache `9such as the one shown in the figure). Assuming all pages needed are in main memory and no need to go to the backing sore to fetch any pages, formulate the Expected Access Time, EAT, for a virtual address (p,d). Consider main memory access to cost m units of time, TLB access to cost mt units of time, and cache access to cost mc units of time. Further assume the probability that a page is in the TLB is Pt, and the probability that the corresponding frame is in the cache memory to be Pc. Notice that the presence of the frame in the cache is a process not dependent on the presence of the corresponding page in the TLB.

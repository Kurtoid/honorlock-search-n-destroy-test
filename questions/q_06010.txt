Directions: Read the following passage and then answer the questions that follow.    In 1990, there was a large oil spill in the waters near Staten Island, New York. The pollution washed into an area of salt marsh called the Arthur Kill marsh. Unwilling to wait while the marsh very slowly repaired itself from the pollution, the New York Parks Department tried a new approach-- planting cordgrass throughout the damaged marsh.  Animal plankton feed on cordgrass. In turn, the animal plankton provide for other organisms in the salt marsh food web, which includes mussels, crabs, fish, birds, and rodents. In addition, cordgrass increases the amount of oxygen in the soil. Bacteria that naturally break down oil appear to require this oxygen.  Within five years, the amount of oil in the Arthur Kill marsh had been reduced by 70 percent. Many types of organisms that had lived in the marsh before the spill returned.

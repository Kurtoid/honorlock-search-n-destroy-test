When radiographing an edentulous area, what may be used to aid in stabilizing the image receptor holder and compensate for the height of the missing tooth?
As we have discussed in class, the results of fishery-independent surveys of sharks (much like the one that UNF conducts) and shark control programs (such as the ones off the southeastern coast of Australia) are commonly used to evaluate the status of shark populations and determine if they are being overfished, either for commercial use or to protect bathers.. The graphs below show the results of a long-term shark control program that takes place off of Queensland, Australia. The program uses two fishing approaches: mesh nets and baited drumlines. The first graph shows the catch (in "catch per unit effort" or CPUE) of hammerhead sharks, whaler sharks, tiger sharks, and white sharks in nets (top row) and drumlines (second row) over time (1960-2020). The second graph shows the length of hammerheads, whaler sharks, and tiger sharks over time. Using these data, briefly answer the following questions:  Based on these data, what are the temporal (time-associated) trends in catch (and shark abundance) that have been observed for each group/species? Please answer this question separately for each group/species and don't just state the overall trend from 1960 to 2020 (in other words, look for periods in the time series that can be "grouped" based on similarities in catch). Based on these data, what are the temporal trends in size of these groups/species? What does this reflect and what is its significance to population growth? As mentioned, both nets and drumlines were used in this control program and the results of these different fishing approaches were presented separately. Based on these results, what can you conclude about the effectiveness of using these approaches to survey the groups/species in question?  Graph 1: Catch of 4 groups/species of shark over time    Graph 2. Length of sharks caught over time

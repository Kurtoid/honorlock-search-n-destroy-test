You just called an RRT for a client admitted with hypokalemia. Current vitals are BP 80/50, HR 92, RR 22, T 98.0, O2 saturation is 90% on 2L/NC. Bilateral lung sounds are clear and the client has a 20ga IV catheter in the right forearm, with 0.9 NS and 20meq KCL infusing via an infusion pump at 83mL/hour. The physician responding to the RRT orders a stat bolus of 500mL of 0.9 NS. Knowing your responsibility as an RN, how will you proceed to carry out this order?

Lee Home Improvement Company installs replacement siding, windows, and louvered glass doors for single-family homes and condominium complexes. The company is in the process of preparing its annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. Andrea Spain, controller for Lee, has gathered the following data concerning inventory. At May 31, 2020, the balance in Lee's Raw Materials Inventory account was $390,456, and Allowance to Reduce Inventory to Market had a credit balance of $18,900. Spain summarized the relevant inventory cost and market data at May 31, 2020, in the schedule below. Spain assigned Peter DeGabriel, an intern from a local college, the task of calculating the amount that should appear on Lee's May 31, 2020, financial statements for inventory at lower-of-cost-or-market as applied to each item in inventory. DeGabriel expressed concern over departing from the historical cost principle. Assume Lee uses LIFO inventory costing.

It's Radioactive! (Canvas Q7~11, Handwritten Pages Q7/9) Uranium is a naturally-occurring radioactive element that is most widely known for its use in nuclear reactors to generate carbon-neutral energy. In order to quantitatively determine the concentration of uranium in a sample, a titration can be performed. In this analysis, all of the uranium in a sample is first converted to uranium(IV) cation, then reacted with a titrant. The most common titrant used is potassium permanganate, as it can also serve as an indicator from its vibrant purple color. The balanced equation for the reaction between uranium(IV) and permanganate is shown below. 3 U4+ (aq) + 2 MnO4- (aq) + 2 H2O (l) - 3 UO22+ (aq) + 2 MnO2 (s) + 4 H+ (aq) (Additional 6 points) On your Handwritten Pages, copy over the balanced equation for the reaction between uranium(IV) and permanganate from above. Assign oxidation states for each type of atom in all substances present. Draw in tie-lines where necessary to indicate changes in oxidation number, and clearly label them as representing a loss or a gain of electrons. ( Q7 )  Is this a redox reaction?

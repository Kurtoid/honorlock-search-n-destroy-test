Use the standard reaction enthalpies given below to determine DHdegrxn for the following reaction: 4 S(s) + 6 O2(g)  -  4 SO3(g)                  DHdegrxn =  ? Given: SO2(g)  -  S(s) + O2(g)                           DHdegrxn = +296.8 kJ 2 SO2(g) + O2(g)  -  2 SO3(g)               DHdegrxn = -197.8 kJ

Northern elephant seals have reduced genetic variation most likely due to being hunted. Hunting reduced their population size to as few as 20 individuals at the end of the 19th century. Since then their population has rebounded to over 30,000 but they have much less variation than a population of Southern Elephant seals that have not been hunted.  This is an example of
Bonus (6 points.) A 60.0 g piece of metal was heated in boiling water to 100.0 oC   and then dropped into water (cwater = 4.184 J/g*oC) in an insulated beaker.  There are 55.0 mL of water (density = 1.00g/mL) in the beaker, and its temperature before the metal was dropped in was 24.0 oC. The final temperature of the metal and water is 27.2 oC. What is the specific heat of the metal? Assume that no heat transfers through the walls of the beaker or to the atmosphere.  (If you wish, you can show math work for possible partial credit.)

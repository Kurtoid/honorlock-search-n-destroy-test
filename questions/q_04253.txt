The four yellow cards are numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4.  The cards are well shuffled.  You randomly draw one card. * G = card drawn is green* Y = card drawn is yellow* E = card drawn has an even number sample space = {G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4}.  Find each of the following.  Round to 3 decimal places. a.  P(G AND E) =  [c] b.  P(G OR E) =  [d] c.  Are G and E mutually exclusive?    Hint:  Mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time.

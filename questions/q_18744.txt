Continuing the previous Bellman-Ford question... Suppose the link between node B and node C goes down. Thus, the link cost between B and C is updated to "infinity". Continue the Bellman-Ford algorithm table from the previous problem. 1. The first row in the table for this question should be exactly the same as the last row of the previous question.  2. The second row in the table for this question should also be exactly the same as the last row of the previous question EXCEPT, increment the Iteration number and change the value of the cost from B  to C to "infinity" .  3. Now, continue the Bellman Ford algorithm using this new update from Node B.  Stop after 5 new rows have been added.  For Example: In other words, if  the last row in your previous answer was Iteration 14, then the first row in this question will be the exact same row, Iteration 14. The second row in this question will be the same as Iteration 14, EXCEPT increment the Iteration number to 15 and change the value for the cost in "(next node, cost)"  for the column B  to C to infinity.  Then, continue the iterations according to the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Stop at Iteration 19.     Answer format:Choose "Table" in the question editing menu and enter the table values accordingly. Except for the first column (Iteration), each entry should have the format  (Next node, Cost). There should not be any blank entries.

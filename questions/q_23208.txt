You have discovered what you think is a new herpesvirus. You have a tube of serum containing the potential virus. When you have looked at it using electron microscopy, you see what you think are herpesvirus particles, at a concentration of about 2.4 x 109 particles/ml. But this does not always equate with titer. What assay would you typically use to figure out the titer of your virus in your serum sample?

In this question our goal is to combine the load/stores or store/stores to generate a parallel instruction (PLDLD - a parallel load/load or PLDST - a parallel load/store or PSTST - a parallel store/store). Parallel instructions execute the underlying operations in parallel therefore improving performance; they also allow us to combine two instructions reducing code size. As seen in the paper on Parallelizing Load/Stores, we are first going to determine the range of motion of instructions , from there build a motion schedule graph (MSG) to check if they could be co-located at the same code position, and finally using this MSG, parallelize the instructions. We will answer these questions using the code excerpt below. //Assumptions: Address addr 1 and addr 2 are two distinct addresses // No optimizations or transformations are to be performed on this code // All the values must be stored and loaded from respective locations since they are live across the code excerpt    MOV r2, 3 ST [addr 1], r2 ST [addr 2], r2 LD r2, [addr 1] LD r3, [addr 1] NOP ST [addr 2], r3 MOV r3, 3    A. A load/store instruction can move up and down, obeying dependencies. Motion range is defined as the interval between program points where a load/store instruction can be legally moved. Given the following code segment, please determine and show the motion range for each load/store instruction. Motion range be shown as an interval {start, end} where start shows a label position above which one can not move the given instruction and end shows the label position below which one can not move the instruction due to dependence constraints. In developing this motion range, we assume that all other instructions remain fixed where they are and do not move. As an example, the motion range of instruction at label 1 is : {1,1} since it cant be moved above label 1 and cant be moved below label 1 due to dependence resulting from register r2 (in this case, instruction at label 2 remains where it is) In the following example, please assume that addr1 and addr2 are distinct (non-conflicting) addresses determined by compile time analysis. Using this information, please show motion range for each of the load/store instructions as per the format: label : {range} for example, 1 : {1, 1} 2:{[lowtwo],[hightwo]} 3:{[lowthree],[highthree]} 4:{[lowfour],[highfour]} 5:{[lowfive],[highfive]} 7:{[lowseven],[highseven]} Continued...

An organic compound absorbs strongly in the IR at 1687 cm-1.  Its 1H NMR spectrum consists of two signals, a singlet at 2.1 ppm and a multiplet centered at 7.1 ppm.  Its mass spectrum shows significant peaks at m/z 120, m/z 105 and m/z 77.  This information is consistent with which of the following structures?
Thank you for your hard work during challenging circumstances this term. Make sure you've reviewed your work and hit submit. Then navigate to the Upload Final Exam Work assignment to post a pdf of your work. Once uploaded, please destroy your scratch paper. Remember that communication with others regarding the content of the final exam, including the discussion of questions and/or answers, is strictly prohibited per the SF student conduct code. Once the testing window closes,  I will calculate your final grades for the course, and post an announcement when grades are available. This will likely be by the end of Friday. Adam

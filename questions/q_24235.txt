QUESTION 1 - 7 Points David Samson had an architect draw up plans for a new office building for his accounting firm.  Ellis Builders, Inc., a local construction company, entered into a contract with Samson to build the office for $1,250,000 on a lot owned by Ellis Builders according to the architectural plans (which plans were made a part of the contract).  The lot and completed office building - ready for occupancy by Samson and his employees - were to be conveyed to Samson by no later than September 1.  The office building was completed on time but during a walk-through inspection of the building before Samson paid for it and took title, he was disappointed to discover the following deviations from the architect's plans (which were the result of the contractors carelessness in following the architect's plans): the front door was supposed to be 12 feet high, but was only 11 feet high; three of the eight outdoor light fixtures were installed incorrectly; the lobby was to be wired for cable television and it was not; the main office was to have six electrical sockets and it only had five; and one office was painted with the wrong color. Samson, who had begun having second thoughts about buying such and expensive office building and was having difficulty with financing from his bank, advised Ellis that he was not going to buy the building because his construction contract with Ellis had been breached by the contractor because of the deviations from the architect's plans (Samson argued that Ellis had violated the perfect tender rule). REQUIRED (7 Points): Is Samson correct in asserting that he is not obligated to purchase the building? Discuss.  What remedies, if any, may be available to Samson?

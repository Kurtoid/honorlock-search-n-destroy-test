SCENARIO 4:   A patient, Mr. Daniels, arrives to the radiology department from the emergency room with severe diarrhea. Dr. Knowitall orders a Small Bowel Series. The on-call radiologist is on his way into the hospital; the radiologist has Dr. Knowitall work with you and has you begin the study. After giving the patient two cups of thin barium you begin taking overhead images. Mr. Daniels has a thinner than average, or hyposthenic, body habitus. You perform a patient interview and a review Mr. Daniel's medical notes from the ER to determine if he has been NPO a minimum of                      hours before the small bowel series.
Two electrons repel each other with a force that varies inversely as the square of the distance between them, where k is the constant of proportionality. One electron is fixed at the point . Find the work done in moving the second electron from  to .
CSMA/CD cannot be used with wireless networks because it is difficult to detect collisions on a wireless LAN.
10.  Basis of a Vector space Given the matrix equation:  Ax = b   where A is the matrix whose column vectors are given by S = {  (-1,2,0,0) (2,0,-1,0), (3,0,0,4)  ( 0,0,5,0)  }   and  b = {  (a ,b,c,d) }  column vector, a)  Write the system as a linear combination of the column vectors of A b)  Do the column vectors actually span R4?  Show this c)  Are the vectors in S linearly independant?  Show d)  What are the implications for S from parts (b) and (c)?  Explain e)  Given x = (2,-3,1,5)  , write x as a linear combination of the vectors in S Give the answer as a coordinate vector.

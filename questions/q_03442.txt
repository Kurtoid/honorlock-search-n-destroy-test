Consider the following instruction breakdown that decomposes an instruction into 4 parts:    OPCODE DST SRC IMM    OPCODE specifies the OPeration's CODE.DST specifies a DeSTination register.SRC specifies a SouRCe register.IMM specifies a 2's complement value (that's IMMediately available as part of the instruction). Assume the architecture has 24-bit instructions, 14 opcodes, and 23 registers. A.) What is the minimum number of bits required to represent an OPCODE? [opcbits] B.) What is the minimum number of bits required to represent a register? [regbits] C.) What is the maximum number of bits that can be used to represent the IMM value? [immbits] D.) What is the largest positive value that can represented by the IMM value? [immval]

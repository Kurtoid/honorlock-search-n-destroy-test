Read the following selection and choose the best answer to the question that follows.    Cultures differ in the overall amount of touching they prefer. People from high-contact cultures such as those in the Middle East, Latin America, and southern Europe touch each other in social conversations much more than do people from noncontact cultures such as Asia and northern Europe. These cultural differences can lead to difficulties in intercultural communication. Germans, Scandinavians, and Japanese, for example, may be perceived as cold and aloof by Brazilians and Italians, who in turn may be regarded as aggressive, pushy, and overly familiar by northern Europeans.      Cultures also differ in where people can be touched. In Thailand and Malaysia, for instance, the head should not be touched because it is considered to be sacred and the locus of a person's spiritual and intellectual powers. In the United States, the head is far more likely to be touched.      Cultures vary in their expectations about who touches whom. In Japan, for instance, there are deeply held feelings against the touch of a stranger. These expectations are culture-specific, and even cultures that exist near one another can have very different norms. Among the Chinese, for instance, shaking hands among people of the opposite sex is perfectly acceptable; among many Malay, it is not. Indeed, for those who practice the Muslim religion, casual touching between members of the opposite sex is strictly forbidden. However, this social taboo refers only to opposite-sex touching; it is perfectly acceptable for two women to hold hands or for men to walk arm in arm. In contrast, many European Americans react negatively to same-sex touching but do not mind opposite-sex touching.      Finally, cultures differ in the settings or occasions in which touch is acceptable. Business meetings, street conversations, and household settings all evoke different norms for what is considered appropriate. Cultures make distinctions between those settings that they regard as public and those considered private. Although some cultures regard touching between men and women as perfectly acceptable in public conversations, others think that such activities should occur only in the privacy of the home. --adapted from Lustig and Koester, Intercultural Competence, pp. 211-212A summary of this selection would include all of the following statements except

June is a PT student on her first internship.  She is performing the objective examination of a patient with presenting complaints of anterior shoulder and anterior arm pain.  As part of the exam, she performs a median nerve test that produces a posterior shoulder pain.  At this point, she determines the test is positive and that the patient's presenting complaints are due to median nerve dysfunction.  Her greatest diagnostic error in deciphering the findings of this test is

One of the landmark moments for surgical medicine came with the discovery in 1942 that a compound from the South American plant called curare (pronounced cure-are-ay) could be used as a supplemental anesthetic.   Prior to that, the main types of anesthetics used in surgery were drugs like diethyl ether.  For an anesthetic to be effective for surgery, it needs to induce a state of unconsciousness and prevent widespread body movement.  The problem with ether was that while a small dose could induce unconsciousness, a much larger dose was required to induce muscle paralysis.     Curare is a selective skeletal muscle paralytic.  (For exactly this reason, many different indigenous peoples in South America have historically used curare extract to coat arrows and darts for hunting.) Curare -- when used in conjunction with ether -- allowed surgeons to use smaller doses of ether, making surgeries much safer. Given what you are told here, what kind of drug is curare?  alpha-adrenergic antagonist beta-adrenergic antagonist muscarinic antagonist nicotinic antagonist  Defend your answer.

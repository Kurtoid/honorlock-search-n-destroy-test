Read the following selection from "The SQ3R Reading Strategy." Then, based on your reading of the selection, choose the most appropriate answer to the question that follows the selection. You may be asked additional questions about the same passage. The SQ3R Reading Strategy You may have heard of the SQ3R method for active reading in your early education. This valuable technique is perfect for college reading. The title stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review, and you can use the steps on virtually any assigned passage. Designed by Francis Pleasant Robinson in his 1961 book Effective Study, the active reading strategy gives readers a systematic way to work through any reading material. Survey is similar to skimming. You look for clues to meaning by reading the titles, headings, introductions, summary, captions for graphics, and keywords. You can survey almost anything connected to the reading selection, including the copyright information, the date of the journal article, or the names and qualifications of the author(s). In this step, you decide what the general meaning is for the reading selection. Question is your creation of questions to seek the main ideas, support, examples, and conclusions of the reading selection. Ask yourself these questions separately. Try to create valid questions about what you are about to read that have come into your mind as you engaged in the Survey step. Try turning the headings of the sections in the chapter into questions. Next, how does what you're reading relate to you, your school, your community, and the world? Read is when you actually read the passage. Try to find the answers to questions you developed in the previous step. Decide how much you are reading in chunks, either by paragraph for more complex readings or by section or even by an entire chapter. When you finish reading the selection, stop to make notes. Answer the questions by writing a note in the margin or other white space of the text. You may also carefully underline or highlight text in addition to your notes. Use caution here that you don't try to rush this step by haphazardly circling terms or the other extreme of underlining huge chunks of text. Don't over-mark. You aren't likely to remember what these cryptic marks mean later when you come back to use this active reading session to study. The text is the source of information--your marks and notes are just a way to organize and make sense of that information. Recite means to speak out loud. By reciting, you are engaging other senses to remember the material--you read it (visual) and you said it (auditory). Stop reading momentarily in the step to answer your questions or clarify confusing sentences or paragraphs. You can recite a summary of what the text means to you. If you are not in a place where you can verbalize, such as a library or classroom, you can accomplish this step adequately by saying it in your head; however, to get the biggest bang for your buck, try to find a place where you can speak aloud. You may even want to try explaining the content to a friend. Review is a recap. Go back over what you read and add more notes, ensuring you have captured the main points of the passage, identified the supporting evidence and examples, and understood the overall meaning. You may need to repeat some or all of the SQR3 steps during your review depending on the length and complexity of the material. Before you end your active reading session, write a short (no more than one page is optimal) summary of the text you read.

A 12 year old male presents to the clinic with hyperkyphosis of the thoracic spine and localized tenderness. He complains of back pain after playing basketball each evening. Which condition is most likely?
One spot on the microarray contains sequences unique to the gene for RNA polymerase. One spot contains sequences unique to the skeletal muscle myosin gene. Which spot would be expected to contain the RNA polymerase gene sequences? The following microarray data are shown for four human genes. Two samples were hybridized to the microarray in this experiment. One sample was cDNA generated from mRNA of a tissue culture cell line derived from a B-cell leukemia. The other sample was cDNA generated from normal, mature neural tissue.  Red means hybridization to cancerous B-cell cDNA. Green means hybridization to normal neural cell cDNA. Yellow means hybridization to both cDNA types. Blank means hybridization to neither cell's cDNA.

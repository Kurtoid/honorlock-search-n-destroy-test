Suppose that Brand X batteries have been redesigned to improve the mean lifetime.  In a production run there are 10000 batteries made with the new design.  A random sample of 10 of these batteries is taken and the lifetimes (in hours) of these ten batteries were measured to be:               31.1, 18.7, 29.5,  27.7,  30.5,  29.1,  23.8,  27.9,  26.3,  26.2               The mean and standard deviation for this sample are 27.08 and 3.67 respectively.   A 95% confidence interval for the mean lifetime is:

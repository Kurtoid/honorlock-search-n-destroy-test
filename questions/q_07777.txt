You have a circular coil of 75 loops of wire with an area of 0.02 m2 that you want to place into a uniform magnetic field with a strength of 0.03 T.   Make a sketch showing how you would orient the coil inside the magnetic field so that the wire would feel the largest torque if a current were flowing through it. You may choose any direction for the magnetic field, but be sure to clearly indicate the direction of the field in your sketch. [2] Add the direction of current flow to your sketch and describe with words or with a labeled arrow in what direction the loop would start to turn if current were flowing in that direction. [1] How much current would you need to pass through the wire so that the magnitude of the torque would be 15 N*m? [3]

You've done a job analysis for a museum curator position.  You think that "Curiosity" is a critical KSAO, so you develop a personality measure that assesses curiosity.  The items seem like they capture the idea of what "Curiosity" means, but you've noticed that, if you give the measure to the same people at two different times, their scores end up being very different. In other words, the scores at different times are not strongly positively correlated with one another.  What is the biggest problem with your measure?

STATISTICS To examine the differences between salaries of male and female middle managers of a large bank, 90 individuals were randomly selected and the following variables considered:  Salary = the monthly salary (excluding fringe benefits and bonuses), Educ = the number of years of education, Exper = the number of months of experience, Train = the number of weeks of training, Gender = the gender of an individual; 1 for males, and 0 for females.  Also, the following Excel partial outputs corresponding to the following models are available:   When testing the individual significance of Educ in the Model, what is the test conclusion at 10% significance level?

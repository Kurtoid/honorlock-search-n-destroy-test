I need to estimate the population of ravers attending Ultra (winter music festival) this year.  I take my net gun and shoot it into the crowd and capture 40 individuals which I mark on the back of the neck with some glow-in-the dark paint to match the environment of waving glowsticks.  I return the next day and use my net gun and sample again and capture 45 ravers of which 1 was marked.  What is the size of the population?

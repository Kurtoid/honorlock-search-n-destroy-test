The enzyme aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) is as an example of allosteric regulation of enzyme activity. ATCase catalyzes an early step in the synthesis of pyrimidines.  Blank #1: Describe the step catalyzed by ATCase. Blank #2: Which of the six classes of enzymes does ATCase belong to? Blank #3: ATCase provides a good example of feedback inhibition. Explain what this means. The graph below represents the activity of ATCase as a function of substrate concentration. The data for this graph was obtained during an experiment at pH 8.3 and 25oC, with ATCase isolated from E. coli. Note that a fraction of maximum velocity (Vmax) of 1.0 means 100% of Vmax.

An instructional resources company claims to have a method to train students which will increase their scores on any standardized test. Concerned that their admission process would be adversely affected, a large university decides to test this claim. The registrar selects, using a method which is independent and random, a group of n=150 high school students. This group is randomly divided in two, n1 =75 students are sent to be trained to increase their test scores and n2 =75 students are shown an inspirational movie to act as a control group.               After training both groups are administered an old I.Q. test, the following results are obtained Ms1=107 and Ms2=102.Any changes due to training represent a change in the location of the mean rather the shape of the distribution, hence s1 = s2.= 15   Compute a 95% confidence interval for u1-u2, the difference in mean I.Q. scores for trained and untrained populations.

Here is one more excerpt from the Sheshunoff opinion:   We agree with Light's recitation of basic contract law in footnote six that "[i]f only one promise is illusory, a unilateral contract can still be formed; the non-illusory promise can serve as an offer, which the promisor who made the illusory promise can accept by performance." Upon further review of the Act and its history, however, we disagree with footnote six insofar as it precludes a unilateral contract made enforceable by performance from ever complying with the Act because it was not enforceable at the time it was made.   At the outset, this language in Light was not essential to the holding in that case. Light held that the agreement in issue was not a unilateral contract but was an enforceable bilateral contract when made because, as the court construed the employer's promise to provide training in that case, the employer had made a promise to provide initial training that was enforceable when made. "Even if Light had resigned or been fired after this agreement was executed, United would still have been required to provide the initial training." Light, 883 S.W.2d at 646. As explained above, the fatal defect in the agreement in Light was not that it was unenforceable when made, but that there was no "ancillary" promise by the employee, such as a promise not to disclose confidential information, that the covenant not to compete was designed to enforce.   Who or what is Light? (One answer is correct.)

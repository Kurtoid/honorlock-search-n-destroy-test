Lecture Test 3, Question 14 The illustration below shows a metapopulation in a moment in time (remember, metapopulations are dynamic systems).  Occupied patches are indicated by solid black fill.  Unoccupied patched are indicated by no fill (white).  All patches are numbered.  The area outside of patches is unsuitable habitat for this species.  Answer the associated questions.           a.  Which unoccupied patch is most likely to remain unoccupied? Explain the rationale for your answer.      b.  Which unoccupied patch is most likely to go extinct if it were colonized?  Explain the rationale for your answer.      c.  Name one way you could manage the metapopulation patches or the unsuitable habitat to increase colonization.

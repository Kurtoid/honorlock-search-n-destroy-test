Transaldolases are enzymes that synthesize unique sugar molecules from other sugars. In their synthesis, they use an aldol condensation mechanism to transfer 3-carbon units from a ketone to an aldehyde.  An example is the Transaldolase reaction below in the Pentose Phosphate Pathway.       This reaction is an equilibrium and involves the synthesis of Fructose -6 Phosphate and Erythrose 4-Phosphate from Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate and Sedoheptulose 7-Phosphate. Based on your knowledge of Aldol condensations, sketch out a mechanism for this reaction and describe it in the textbox below. Use the colors as a guide to follow the carbon chains. In your mechanism, you need to include all stable intermediates and arrows will need to make since for full credit. After the test is over, send me your mechanism by email: doba.jackson@hawks.huntingdon.edu.

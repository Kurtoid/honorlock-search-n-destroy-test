(Chapter 15) Max's Movie Store encounters revenue-allocation decisions with its bundled product sales. Here, two or more of the movie videos are sold as a single package. Managers at Max's are keenly interested in individual product-profitability figures. The stand-alone selling price for New Releases is $25 per unit. The stand-alone selling price for Older Releases is not given. The New Releases and Older Releases are also sold at a discount as a bundle for $40. Max's is using the Shapley method of allocating revenue based on the sales prices, taking into account how many units are sold of the individual products. For each 4 units sold of New Releases, Max sells 1 unit of Older Releases (4:1) For each package 'New & Older', Max's allocates $ 22.00 to 'New Releases'. What is the stand-alone selling price for Older Releases?
Here is the same excerpt from the Texas Supreme Court decision in Alex Sheshunoff Management Services, L.P. v. Johnson:   ASM sued Johnson, alleging breach of the covenant not to compete and seeking injunctive relief and damages.  Strunk intervened.  The court granted a temporary injunction.  Strunk and Johnson then moved for summary judgment, arguing that the covenant was unenforceable as a matter of law.  They argued that under footnote six of Light, 883 S.W.2d at 645 n.6 (discussed below), ASM's promises to provide confidential information and specialized training were illusory at the time the agreement was made and the covenant was therefore unenforceable.  The district court granted the summary judgment motions. The court then entered a final judgment.  The court of appeals affirmed.   In the excerpt above, who is ASM? (Two answers are correct.  Both correct answers must be chosen in order to receive any credit.)
As discussed in class, one of the jobs done to land aircraft on a carrier is performed by a petty officer called a spotter.  He/she must decide in seconds whether it is safe for an approaching aircraft to land on the carrier.  If he/she decides that it is not safe, the aircraft will not be allowed to land.  In addition, several other personnel on the flight deck and in the tower can also veto a landing.  Essentially, low ranking officers can veto a decision made at higher levels.  The idea is that for this particular task the system works best when those closest to the problem conditions can react and make informed decisions in a timely manner.  With respect to this decision situation, this would represent a:

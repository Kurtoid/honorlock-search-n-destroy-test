Consider the greedy NavMesh generation algorithm. For each of the NavMesh generation scenarios depicted below, select which test would resolve the problem observed (unless there is no issue). NavMesh triangles are show with a pattern fill. If triangles overlap, a darker region is shown where the overlap occurs. Obstacles are shown in blue with "Obstacle" text. The adjacency graph is shown with red line segments. Note that expanded geometry is omitted for simplicity.

The authors were interested in determining whether daily video/computer interaction (ie Skype) would increase the proportion of prescribed cardiac medications taken in a sample of elderly individuals who have congestive heart failure (CHF). They began their project with some general questions, such as: Are the elderly familiar with video/computer technology (ie, Skype)? What factors affect medication compliance? Who is most likely to respond best to reminders? The authors proceeded to reflect on their experiences and observations relative to these issues and reviewed the literature to find whether other researchers had studied these problems. Based on their review and reflections, the authors developed the following hypotheses: #1- Elderly patients receiving daily video/computer reminders will have increased medication compliance #2 - There is no relationship between medication compliance and daily video/computer reminders for elderly patients living alone #3 - There is an association between medication compliance and daily video/computer reminders #4 - Women, more so than men, will respond best to telephone reminders

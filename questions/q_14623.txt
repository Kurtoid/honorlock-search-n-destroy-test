(30 points) Annual demand for pencils is normally distributed with a mean of 1,000 and a standard deviation of 250. The store purchases the pencils for 6 cents each and sells them for 20 cents each. There is a two-month lead time from the initiation to the receipt of an order. The store estimates that the cost to initiate and receive an order is $20, and recommends a 22 percent annual interest rate for determining holding cost. The cost of a stock-out is the cost of lost profit plus an additional 20 cents per pencil, which represents the cost of loss of goodwill.  a) (25 pts) Find the simultaneous optimal values of Q and R. b) (5 pts) What is the safety stock for the pencil at the optimal solution?        (35 points) One wishes to schedule vehicles from a central depot to five customer locations. The cost of making trips between each pair of locations is given in the following matrix. (Assume that the depot is location 0.)  Cost matrix cij:                                                To           From                 0   1   2   3   4   5     0       20   75   33   10   30     1           35   5   20   15     2               18   58   42     3                   40   20     4                       25     Assume that these costs correspond to distances between locations and that each vehicle is constrained to travel no more than 50 miles on each route (the 50 miles does not include the drive from and to the depot (0)). Find the routing suggested by the savings method developed by Clarke and Wright.        (25 points) Customers arrive in a bakery with an average time between arrivals of 5 minutes. However, there is quite a lot of variability in the customers' arrivals. The single server requires an amount of time having the exponential distribution with a mean of 4.5 minutes to serve customers (in the order in which they arrive). Consider this as an M/M/1 queue.  a) (10 pts) Calculate the average utilization of the server. b) (5 pts) Calculate how long customers spend on average to complete their transaction (time in queue plus service time). c) (5 pts) Calculate how long customers spend on average in the queue. d) (5 pts) How many customers are in the bakery on average?          (10 points) Please assign the inventory control models we have learned into their correct category (only one).  Inventory control models: (a) The basic EOQ model (b) The EOQ with a finite production rate (c) EOQ models for production planning (d) Newsvendor model (e) (Q, R) model with service levels (f) (Q, R) model with stock-out cost (g) (Q, R) model periodic review with (s, S) policies (h) Resource-constrained multiple product systems (i) Quantity discounts (j) ABC analysis (item A)   Category:      Known demand, continuous review Know demand, periodic review Uncertain demand, continuous review Uncertain demand, periodic review

Write a Java program to calculate the capital gain of the following stock portfolio:                          Table 1. Stock Portfolio    Stock Symbols Number of Shares Cost per Share   FB 100 132.48   AMZN 10 805.66   AAPL 120 108.50   NFLX 50 143.72   GOOG 20 798.53     Note: a stock symbol (or ticker symbol) is an abbreviation used to uniquely identify a publicly traded stock. For example, FB for Facebook, AMZN for Amazon, AAPL for Apple, NFLX for Netflix, GOOG for Google, as in the first column of Table 1. Requirements:  Write a complete Java program starting from the public class declaration. Declare a method that takes a stock symbol as the argument and returns the latest price of this stock.  Note: You only need to write the declaration of the method. Skip the body of the method (i.e., you can simply omit the body of the method). In your main method, simply assume this method has been implemented and is able to retrieve from online the latest price of the stock symbol given as the argument.   In the main method, do the following (REQUIRED):  i) Create three arrays to store the data in Table 1. ii) Use a loop to calculate the total capital gain of the entire portfolio.  Note: Inside the loop, you need to call the method declared above to retrieve the latest price of each stock listed in Table 1. (Hint: use the return value of the method as pricei in the formula below.)The total capital gain of the portfolio equals the sum of the gain of each stock i, that is,                                iii)   Display the result. The output of your program should look like the following:                                                     Portfolio Gain: $1270.50 Note: Display the $ sign (hint: a regular character) and 2 decimal places.
Anthropology is distinctive from other academic disciplines that study humans because it developed and depends on the concept of ________for explaining behavioral differences among human groups, it emphasizes holism (the study and integration of many kinds of data about humans) and it is comparative across cultures and across species.   Anthropology is a science, a social science and a __________. Anthropologists document and record the diversity of human expression found in cultures around the world in art, architecture, dance, music, stories, dress, etc.  Humans are the only species to have these forms of expression.    Biological anthropologists (a.k.a. physical anthropologists) study the human and pre-human ________record (paleoanthropology), the distribution of genes in contemporary humans (human variation), disease pathology evident in the bones of people who lived and died hundreds and thousands of years ago (paleopathology) and the anatomy, ecology and behavior of contemporary non-human primates (primatology).    _________emphasizes explicit methods for data collection and analysis that can be replicated by independent observers. It requires that all assertions (hypotheses) are subject to challenge and testing (assertions can be falsified).    When applied to biological organisms, _________explains the existence of modern organisms as the end-product of a process which involves sequential, intergenerational change (generally over a long time scale).   Darwinism is the name given to the idea that evolution is the result of the action of natural selection producing change in successive populations. ________is a more evolved version of evolutionary explanation which includes an understanding of the role of genetics in producing and redistributing the enormous amounts of variation found in natural populations.    In his book The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871) ________ introduced the concept of sexual selection to explain how a trait which makes an individual vulnerable to predation (such as the peacock's tail) might exist in a species because females find it attractive.   ________ are the only vertebrates to have a complex system of reproduction which includes internal gestation, lactation and extended parental care.   All primates have eyes facing in the forward plane with some degree of bony eye protection. Supported by visual information sent by each eye to each hemisphere of the brain, this provides the basis for ___________ vision (which allows primates to be good at judging distance).    Primates are an order of mammals characterized by grasping hands with nails and tactile pads. These tactile pads have touch receptors which send information to the brain.  Primates use their hands for feeding and make intensive use of ____________ coordination.   All hominoids show adaptations for ___________ including long muscular arms, a shoulder joint with 360 degree rotation, fully extendable elbow, 180 degree forearm rotation and an increase is side-to-side wrist motion. Humans are hominoids and have all of these adaptations.  Monkeys do not have this array of adaptations.  They are quadrupedal walkers and runners who travel on the tops of branches.

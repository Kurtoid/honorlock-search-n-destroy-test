Which of the following parental behaviors is linked to higher rates of altruistic or prosocial behavior in their children?
Some students have been told that people remember words that are written in green ink better than red ink. Therefore, I collected data from 2 sections of Psych 202. My 2:30 pm class had a list of words in green ink to memorize. My 4:00 pm class had a list of words in red ink to memorize. After a delay, student recalled as many words as they could. My 2:30 pm class with green ink (group 1) had a mean of 25.4 words, SS = 1030, n = 36. My 4:00 pm class with red ink (group 2) had a mean of 23.5 words, SS = 930, n = 36. Together their pooled variance is 28. Use the 7 steps of hypothesis testing to conduct an independent samples t-test that answers this question and use an a = .05. 1) IV: [IV] DV: [DV] number of tails: [tails] 2) State Hypotheses: Null: [Null] Alternative: [Alternative] 3) What is your critical value? [critical] 4) Calculate the appropriate test statistic. Show your work. Numerator = [Numerator] Denominator = [Denominator] Final obtained test statistic = [TestStat] 5) Decision: [Decision] 6) Effect size: Calculation/work: [Calculation] Final effect size value = [Effect] 7) Plain English interpretation: [PE] APA statistical information: [APA]

Instructions: Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.        (1) Most of the ingredients in cigarettes cause serious damage to health, but three of the worst are tar, carbon monoxide, and nicotine. (2) Tar, the brown, sticky substance produced by a burning cigarette, is a messy mixture of hundreds of toxic chemicals. (3) At least forty-three of those chemicals cause cancer. (4) The other two destructive substances, carbon monoxide and nicotine, contribute to heart disease. (5) Carbon monoxide prevents red blood cells from carrying a full load of oxygen. (6) Therefore, it reduces the body's oxygen supply. (7) At the same time, nicotine is not only constricting blood vessels and impairing blood flow but also stimulating the heart, making it beat faster and crave more oxygen. (8) Consequently, carbon monoxide and nicotine work together to damage the cardiovascular system.   Select the number of the topic sentence in the paragraph above.

In the game Demolition Drake: Duck Squad, consider the AI agent, Sargent Snipe, moving in a 2D continuous space via steering behaviors. Sargent Snipe is currently at position (20.0, -10.0) m and traveling at her maximum speed with velocity (0.0, 5.0) m/s. In the current simulation frame, a Shrike Ray (collectable super weapon) randomly appears at position (15.0, -10) m. Sargent Snipe wants the Shrike Ray and immediately begins moving towards it at maximum acceleration (5 m/s2). She will continue to maximally accelerate (with velocity clamped to maximum speed) towards the Shrike Ray until it is collected. The collider radii of Sargent Snipe and the Shrike Ray are both 0.25 m, and a contact between the two colliders will register as a pick-up. The game simulation runs at 60 Hz. At what simulation time (in seconds) will Sargent Snipe collect the Shrike Ray? For this scenario, the moment the Shrike Ray appears is at time 0 s.

Write a function called spin_wheel that takes an integer n as a parameter and simulates the spinning of a wheel until the number 2 comes up n times in a row. The wheel contains the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 and each number should be equally likely to come up when the wheel is spun. Your function should report the individual spins as well as indicating how many times it takes to get n occurrences of 2 in a row. Two example calls are shown below: spin_wheel(2); spin_wheel(3); The first call should produce two lines of output like this: spins: 4, 4, 5, 2, 5, 5, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2 2 in a row after 13 spins The second call should produce two lines of output like this: spins: 5, 5, 5, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2 3 in a row after 10 spins Notice that the spin values are separated by commas and that the function stops when it has seen n occurrences of the value 2 in a row. You are to exactly reproduce the format of these logs. You may assume that the value n passed to your function is greater than or equal to 1.

Imagine you are crossing two fictitious diploid organisms that are true breeding for red eyes (RR) and white eyes (rr).  These are the only alleles for this gene, and the cross is RR x rr.  As we know, all F1 offspring will be heterozygous Rr so you don't have to figure this part out.  Anyway, this is not about crosses but about offspring phenotypes.   Using our dominance inheritance rules as shown in lecture and text, name the specific trait of eye color that will result in these F1 (Rr) offspring if the inheritance type for this gene varies as shown below.  Just write the trait, nothing more.  (3pt) A) complete dominance specific trait is______________ B) incomplete dominance specific trait is _________________ C) co-dominance specific trait is ____________________

A seller (Senior Welders, Inc.) and buyer (Astoria Manufacturing Co.) have included the following provision in their sale of goods contract (along with other normal terms and conditions): "Seller shall not be responsible for any consequential damages incurred by buyer in the event of a breach of any warranty resulting from this contract." Senior is engaged in the business of selling heavy-duty welders to industrial and other business users. Typically, buyers use the welders with regard to the maintenance of their facilities. The welder sold to the Astoria was defective and, as a result, it started on fire and caused serious damage to the Astoria manufacturing facility. No express warranties were included in the contract between Senior and Astoria. Astoria has sued Senior for breach of warranty and claims that Senior is liable for the damage to its plant. Senior has defended on the basis that no warranty was breached and, further, that the contract provision quoted above absolved it for any liability for the fire damage to the Astoria manufacturing facility. Which of the following statements is correct?

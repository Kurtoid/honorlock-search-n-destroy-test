In drosophila, b is a recessive autosomal mutation that results in black body color and vg is a recessive autosomal mutation that results in short crumpled (vestigial) wings. Wild-type flies have grey bodies and long wings. Crossing true-breeding normal flies with true breeding recessive parent of the two traits produce F1 which look normal for both traits. F1 when self crossed produced the following F2 295 grey, vestigial wings 1,294 grey, normal wings 1,450 black, vestigial wings 241 black, normal wings The calculate chisquare value was 8119 which is large. What will be your conclusion?

A random sample of 500 adult residents of Maricopa County found that 385 were in favor of increasing the highway speed limit to 75 mph, while another sample of 400 adult residents of Pima County found that 267 were in favor of the increased speed limit. Use a=0.01. Do these data indicate that there is a difference in the support for increasing the speed limit between the residents of the two counties?

Can it be concluded that engine B has a better performance that engine A? If the standard deviation of hole diameter exceeds 0.01 millimeters, there is an unacceptable high probability that the rivet will not fit. A sample of 15 diameters has a standard deviation of 0.008 millimeters. Is there strong evidence to indicate that the standard deviation of hole diameter exceeds 0.01 millimeter?     The life in hours of a battery is known to be normally distributed. A random sample of 10 batteries has a mean life of 40,5 hours. Is there evidence to support the claim that battery life differs from 40 hours?

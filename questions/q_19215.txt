To prevent timing attacks, Betty has changed her exponentiation implementation such that it always multiplies the result with something - with the message when the exponent's bit is 1, or with the value of 1 (thus not really modifying the result) when the exponent's bit is zero. In this code, exp, ctable[0] and ctable[1], and one are large numbers, each occupying tens of consecutive cache blocks.   // For each bit in the exponentfor(int bit_idx=nbits-1; bit_idx>=0; bit_idx--){   BN_sqr(res,res); // res=res*res;   // Get bit_idx'th bit from large number exp   bool bit= get_bit_at_index(exp,bit_idx);   if(bit)      BN_mul(res,res,ctable[1]); // res=res*msg   else      BN_mul(res,res,ctable[0]); // res=res*1} Your answer should have two paragraphs, one for part A and one for part B below. A. Explain how the updated code prevents timing attacks. B. The code shown above is still vulnerable to Prime+Probe attacks. To prevent Prime+Probe attacks, Betty can add Scatter-Gather mitigation to the code above. The first byte of the first affected large-number value was at address 0x100 in memory both before and after the Scatter-Gather was applied. Each cache block is comprised of 16 Bytes. At what address would the second byte of the first affected large-number value be after Scatter-Gather is applied? Explain your answer.

Instructions: Study the body of each of the following paragraphs. Then, select the letter of the topic sentence that is most accurate.   Select the best topic sentence for the paragraph.     A study conducted by George Washington University and the National Endowment for the Arts showed that senior citizens who sing in a choir are physically healthier than senior citizens who aren't involved in an arts program. Plus, the singers are less likely to suffer from depression and mental deterioration. Dr. Graham Welch of the University of Surrey, who has spent over thirty years researching the effects of singing, claims that singing requires breathing deeply, so it's good aerobic exercise for the lungs, abdominal muscles, and circulatory system. Physician Eric Roter, who reviews the connection between music and health on his web site ermusic.org, agrees. He says that when people sing, the body responds as though it was getting a physical workout. Plus, singing just makes people feel good. Research from Manchester University suggests that singing stimulates a small organ in the inner ear called the saccule, which produces pleasure. Also, endorphins released during singing relax the body and lift the singer's spirits.
Hank earns $24.00 per hour regular rate and time-and-a-half for hours in excess of 40 per week. He worked 44 hours at his job during the first week of March 2018. Hank pays income taxes at 15% and  OASDI (Social security 6.2%) and Medicare (1.45%). All of his income is taxable under FICA. Determine Hank's gross pay for the week. (Do not round any intermediate calculations, and round your final answer to the nearest cent.)

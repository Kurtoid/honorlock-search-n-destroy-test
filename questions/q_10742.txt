Using the same hormone flow chart above and the Answer bank below (its the same as the one above) answer the following. Since the hormone in #47 is a [52] (52) hormone it causes the gland that it binds to to grow. If someone is consuming a diet low in a certain element (IE: its in the periodic table of elements, but its also something we eat): [53](53: put the first letter of that element here, don't worry if its also a letter in the table below), then they can't make the hormone: [54](54: input the hormone abbreviation here just put in one, not more than one). The problem described above can result in a goiter because the hormone in #49 is the primary [55](55) feedback for the release of the higher level hormones. .     A. Anterior Pituitary   F.

Terry Doyle of CommuniCom, Inc. changed how the work and tasks were delegated in the organization to create small, independent teams. She was performing the managerial function of
Although we focused on the hormonal regulation by reversible phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase which acts to regulate glucose levels on a timescale of several hours, it is also important to know that these enzymes are also regulated allosterically on a moment-to-moment basis by a cellular response to glucose levels. In the graph below are the response curves for enzyme activity (glycogen phosphorylase - red curve, glycogen synthase - black curve) over time to adding glucose to a liver cell extract, e.g., all necessary enzymes and substrates for glycogen metabolism.   What is your conclusion regarding allosteric control of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase?

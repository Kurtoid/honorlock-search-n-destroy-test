A wealthy man approached a lawyer to represent him in a dispute with his neighbor.  The lawyer agreed to charge the man $5,000 if the man won the dispute and $500 if the man lost the dispute.  The fee was a reasonable one for the risk and complexity of the case.  The man agreed to the representation verbally and the lawyer began working for the man.  The lawyer sent the man a letter detailing the fee agreement, but no signatures were obtained.  One month later, the lawyer obtained the relief that the man had wanted - the neighbor moved a fence that crossed the man's property.

This Problem Counts 3 Points  Let's say that Saint Andrews Chips considers a 4th option regarding the industrial grade bagging machine.  Saint Andrews Chips engineers have determined that if the firm buys the machine (without the service contract) a method can be devised by their maintenance organization to preserve and actually enhance the capability of the machine over time. By reinvesting 25% of the annual cost savings back into new machine parts, the engineers can increase the cost savings at a 3% annual rate. For example, at the end of year one, 25% of the $25,000 cost savings ($6,250) is reinvested in the machine, resulting in $18,750 in savings. Next year, the cash flow from cost savings grows by 3% and so on. As long as the 25% reinvestment continues, the cash flows continue to grow at 3% in perpetuity. Determine the net present value of this option and select the answer that comes the closest to your solution.

Complete the following problems on your own paper. Please use a separate sheet of paper for each problem. You must show your work in order to receive full credit. Correct answers without justification will only receive partial credit. (You do not have to show every step of computation, but I should be able to follow the thought process you used in completing the problem. No notes, calculators, or electronic devices may be used on this quiz. There are 30 possible points on this quiz. Problem 1. (10 points) A spring has a natural length of 2 feet. A 10-pound force is required to stretch the spring to a total length of 3 feet. How much work is required to stretch the spring from its natural length to a length of 5 feet? (Don't forget to include units in your solution.) Problem 2. (10 points) Use the disk/washer method to set up an integral for the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the region under the curve  from  to  .  Problem 3. (10 points) Use the cylindrical shell method to set up an integral for the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the region under the curve  from  to . Hint: Although this is the same solid of revolution as in Problem 2, I recommend drawing a new picture; this may help prevent error. Problem 4. (0 points) You just set up an integral for the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the region under the curve  from  to , using two different methods. If time allows, evaluate the integrals for each problem to verify that both methods gave the same solution. When you are finished, please keep in mind that you should remain in the Zoom session until you have successfully uploaded your quiz to Gradescope.

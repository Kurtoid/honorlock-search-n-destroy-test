Question 38 (4 points) In 2015, Michigan passed a law requiring all persons with a felony conviction in another state to register that conviction with the State of Michigan. Under the new statute, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2016, "any person residing in the State of Michigan is required to register any felony conviction previously or subsequently obtained against him/her in another state within 90 days of (1) the date this law takes effect, (2) the date the individual establishes permanent residency in Michigan, or (3) the date that any such felony conviction becomes final, whichever comes last." Violation of the registration requirement is a misdemeanor offense, punishable by a fine up to $500 and up to 6 months in jail.   Laney has been living in Michigan since 2010. She had a felony conviction for obtaining money by false pretenses in Oklahoma in 2008. Laney has never heard of Michigan's felony registration statute and has not registered her Oklahoma felony. When she applies for a job with a local police department in Michigan in 2018, they discover her Oklahoma conviction, and Laney is later charged with violating Michigan's mandatory felony registration law.   *You are Laney's attorney. Make an argument for why the trial court should not allow this charge to proceed to trial. Your argument need not be in any particular format and need not cite specific cases. Focus on the legal principles/rules that we have studied that arguably suggest that such a prosecution would be improper in Laney's case.

Delta Corp. will merge into Sigma Corp. Prior to the merger, Delta Corp. has 10 million shares outstanding and 4,500 shareholders. The largest Delta shareholder owns 3 percent of the outstanding stock, and Delta senior executives and directors, collectively, own 700,000 shares. Sigma Corp., before the merger, has 10 million shares outstanding, and its shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. No one person owns more than 2 percent of Sigma stock. Sigma senior executives and directors, collectively, own 300,000 Sigma shares. The merger agreement provides that upon consummation of the merger, each outstanding common share of Delta will be converted into one-half of a common share of Sigma. (In other words, the merger exchange rate is 2 for 1.) After the merger (assuming no shareholder of either corporation exercises appraisal rights, if applicable), Sigma Corp. will have 15 million common shares outstanding; the pre-merger Sigma shareholders will continue to hold, collectively, 10 million Sigma shares; and the pre-merger Delta shareholders will now hold, collectively, 5 million newly issued Sigma shares.

Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that deals with:
You wish to purify His-tagged b-actin, starting from a human cell line. The first step of this process would be to
A straight stretch of horizontal pipe having a diameter of 5 cm is used in the laboratory to measure the viscosity of crude oil (g = 0.93 t/m3). During a test run, a pressure difference of 1.75 t/m2 is obtained from two pressure gauges, which are located 6 m apart on the pipe. Oil is allowed to discharge into a weighing tank, and a total of 550 kg of oil is collected for a duration of 3 minutes. Determine the viscosity of the oil in x10-5 tsec/m2. (i.e., if you obtained a result of 12.34x10-5 just write the coefficient 12.34).

A spherical snowball is melting in such a way that it maintains its shape.  The snowball is decreasing in volume at a constant rate of 24 cubic centimeters per hour.  At what rate, in centimeters per hour, is the radius of the snowball decreasing at the instant when the radius is 10 centimeters? (The volume of a sphere of radius r is
In the film on lizard evolution, Losos examined the same stretch of DNA from many species to  uncover their evolutionary relationships. The results supported the hypothesis that  lizards on  each island tend to be more closely related to each other, than to similar-looking lizards on  different islands. That means that generally the same types of lizards evolved independently on  each island.
The myofibrils consist of both thin filaments made of actin proteins, and thick filaments composed of
The figure represents the initial contents of a reaction vessel mixture of NO and O2 at a pressure of 1 atm.  Keeping the volume and temperature constant, what are the final total pressure (Ptot) and partial pressure of NO2 (PNO2) when the reaction is complete (assuming a 100% yield)?      2NO(g) + O2(g) - 2NO2(g)

A hospital requires some amount of certain radioactive element, molybdenum-99 (99Mo), for certain procedures. Based on the prescheduled appointments for the next month the required amount of 99Mo is  during day . Cost associated with acquiring 99Mo on day  depends on many factors and can be simplified as  per unit. There is also an upper bound  on how much 99Mo can be acquired on each day. Finally, due to its radioactive nature, 99Mo quickly decays at rate 20% per day. Assume that unlimited amount of  99Mo can be stored at the hospital.  Formulate the problem of determining minimum cost plan for the hospital to acquire and store 99Mo.  Write the LP model and explain all variables and constraints on your paper.  In the field below, only type one constraint that serves for connecting the amount of 99Mo from one day to the next.

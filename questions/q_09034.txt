Question 1 (40 pts.) Given: A 50 m section of a longer pipeline is shown below. Fluid (r=1200 kg/m3, m=0.25 Pa*s (kg/m*s)) flows through the pipe section from 1 to 2 (constant D = 5 cm) at a flow rate of 3.9 X 10-3 m3/s. Required: Compute:a) Reynolds number (Re) (6 pts.)b) Head loss due to friction through the pipe section, in m (9 pts.)c) Change in pressure from 1 to 2, in kPa (9 pts.)d) Power rating of a pump with e =0.75 needed to keep the fluid moving from 1 to 2, in kW (8 pts.). Discussion: (8 pts.) Report your results in complete sentences (3 pts). Address the following: If design changes were made to pipe size or flow rate, would this have potential to influence your answers (1 pt.)? Give a specific example of how a change in design could change your results (4 pts).      Question 2 (15 pts.) Given: The beaker below is filled with kerosene to an initial height of h = 0.10 m. The beaker is then rotated around its central axis at a constant angular velocity of 30 rad/s.   Required: Calculate the maximum height (in m) the kerosene would rise against the wall of the beaker while rotating (10 pts).  Discussion: (5 pts) Report your result in a complete sentence (2 pts). Will the kerosene spill out of the beaker? (1 pt) Why or why not? (2 pts) Question 3 (44 pts.) Given: A pool filled with salt water (r=63.9 lbm/ft3) has a curved section along a 15 ft wall which is a  1/4  circular arc (as shown from A to B) with radius of 0.60 ft.      Required: Calculate a)    hydrostatic force on the curve (in lbf) (26 pts) b)    angle of the line of action relative to horizontal (5 pts.).  Discussion: (13 pts.) Draw a sketch of the arc AB and show the magnitude and line of action of hydrostatic force (5 pts). Discuss how the magnitude of hydrostatic force computed would change if the pool were instead filled with fresh water (r=62.4 lbm/ft3) (8 pts).  Question 4 (1 pt.)  Are you ready to submit your exam? Type 'yes' in the box below and then click 'Submit Quiz'. You will then have 10 minutes or until 8:45 am (whichever comes first) to upload your exam.

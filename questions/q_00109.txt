Points from this section will be added when I hand grade this section and the essay questions. Michael was a pleasant, happy infant who seemed to be developing normally until about six months of age. Able to roll over and sit for a few seconds, suddenly he seemed to lose those abilities. Soon, he no longer turned and smiled at his mother's voice, as he had before, and he did not seem as interested in his mobile as he once was. Concerned about Michael's reversals in development, his anxious parents took him to the doctor. It took exams by several specialists to diagnose Michael's Tay-Sachs disease, because, thanks to screening programs in the population groups known to have this inherited illness, fewer than ten new cases appear each year.

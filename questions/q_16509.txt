The data below (taken from a published study) show: (Left) Representative examples of migration tracks of cells expressing normal (b1wt) or mutant (W775A) integrins cultured on fibronectin-coated surfaces and tracked for 12 hours. (Randomly selected individual migration tracks were combined into a single figure to avoid empty spaces. Scale bar = 100 mm). (Right) Quantification of the persistence of migratory velocity and directionality (D/T, which is similar to the persistence measurement discussed in class) of cells expressing normal (b1wt) or mutant (W775A) integrins, where D/T ratios represent the ratio of the direct distance from start to end point, D, divided by the total track distance, T.  Based on the above presented data, explain what effect this mutation of the integrin receptor has on fibroblast cell migration (Hint: make reference to the surface the cells are cultured on, and you may want to refer to receptor-ligand interactions).

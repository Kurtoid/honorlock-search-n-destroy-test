This problem statement applies to questions 44-47:  A sled is pulled to the top of a hill. The sketch above indicates the shape of the hill. At the top of the hill the sled is released from rest and allowed to coast down the hill. At the bottom of the hill the sled has a speed v and a kinetic energy E (the energy due to the sled's motion). Answer the following questions. In every case friction and air resistance are so small they can be ignored. Question 45: Compare the kinetic energy (energy of motion) of the sled at the bottom for the original hill and the steeper hill in the previous problem. Choose the best answer below. A. The kinetic energy the sled at the bottom is greater for the steeper hill.B. The kinetic energy of the sled at the bottom is the same for both hills.C. The kinetic energy at the bottom is greater for the original hill.D. There is not enough information given to say which kinetic energy is greater.J. None of these descriptions is correct.

General Motion: Given the person in the cannonball projectile situation above reaches a perfectly vertical position at the APEX of the trajectory what is the total speed of the point P on their head at that time point. Consider both the projectile motion of their center of mass from above and the rotational motion of the flip. Given: angular velocity is 6 rad/s and the radius of rotation from the COM to point P is r=0.4 m.

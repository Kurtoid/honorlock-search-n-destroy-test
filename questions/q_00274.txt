The Mega Construction Company recently switched to activity-based costing (ABC) from the department allocation method. The department method allocated overhead costs at a rate of $60 per machine hour. The cost accountant for the Finishing Department has gathered the following data:      Activity Cost Drivers Rate   Material handling Tons of material handled $ 80     Machine setups Number of production runs   3,750     Utilities Machine hours   25     Quality control Number of inspections $ 500           During April, Mega purchased and used $100,000 of direct materials at $20 per ton. There were 8 production runs using a total of 12,000 machine hours in April. The manager of the Finishing Department needed 12 inspections. Actual overhead costs totaled $820,000 for the month.   How much overhead costs were applied to the Work-in-Process Inventory during April using activity-based costing?
Consider the following experimental design. A research study tested the hypothesis that there would be an interaction on walking performance between two factors: the difficulty a cognitive dual task and crossing an obstacle while walking.  Outcome measure: gait velocity  Factor 1 Difficulty of Cognitive dual task:                  Levels: No cognitive task, easy cognitive task, difficult cognitive task  Factor 2 Obstacle Cross:                  Levels: no obstacle, obstacle in path  Covariate: leg length was also recorded for this study.  All participants performed all combinations of levels of the two factors in this within subject design. *a cognitive dual task is a verbal task such as counting backward from 100 by 7's performed simultaneous to a motor task which in this case is walking.

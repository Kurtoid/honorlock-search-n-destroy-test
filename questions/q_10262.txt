Research has shown that the risk of lung cancer is 10 times greater among smokers (compared with non-smokers), and 5 times greater among those exposed to asbestos (compared with those not exposed). But the risk of lung cancer among smokers exposed to asbestos is 50 time greater (compare with those not exposed to either). This is a way to describe the:

Bonus The disease EID (Epidemiology Infectious Diseasitis) was first discovered in an online discussion board in the College of Public Health at UF on 8/1/21. The incubation period appears to be 12 weeks long. The symptoms include, but are not limited to: delirium, blurry vision (that can only be corrected by reading glasses), excitement at other people's morbidity and mortality rates, and a desire to make the world a better place. Since the local county epidemiologist has succumbed to the disease, your services as a public health officer have been requested. You are trying to create a case definition for this novel disease.

16   100 g of water at 25 degC is poured into an insulating cup. 50 g of ice at 0 degC is added to the water. The water is stirred until the temperature of the water has fallen to 0 degC.   18 g of ice remains unmelted.   The specific heat capacity of water is 4.2 J/g degC.   Which value does this experiment give for the specific latent heat of fusion of ice?

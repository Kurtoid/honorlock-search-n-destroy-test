Occupational performance is negatively impacted by a lack of motivation for individuals diagnosed with eating disorders. Which of the following is NOT one of the five key cognitive concepts that commonly affect motivation for this population.
A computer manufacturer orders 10,000 computer chips per day. As part of its strict quality assurance program, it tests each daily batch of chips for defects. It is too costly to test all of the chips, so instead the manufacturer randomly selects 200 chips and tests them. If more than 2% of these 200 are defective, then the daily batch is rejected and sent back; otherwise, the batch is accepted. Determine the population and sample in this problem. Type your answer in the text box below. (Be precise with your language!)

Question 3(60 pts)   Analyze the differential amplifier shown in the figure below. Assume the transistors are identical, b = 100 and VA = [?].  Remember you may apply approximations that change the answer by less than 2% with a brief justification.  DC analysis. Calculate the DC values of 1) the collector currents of Q1 and Q2: Ic1 and Ic2, 2) collector voltages of Q1 and Q2: Vc1 and Vc2, 3) VA at node A, 4) VB at node B, and 5) the current through the 600W resistor, I. Draw the small-signal half-circuit model for the differential mode. Find the small-signal input resistances, Ridm, and single-end output gain, A'dm. Draw the small-signal half-circuit model for the common mode. Find the small-signal single-end output gain, Acm.  Calculate the CMRR, the common mode rejection ratio, in dB.

Write a function called countAllergies that takes in two parameters: a list of dinner foods (str) and an allergy (str). This function should return the number of dinner foods that you cannot eat due to your allergy. Make sure that your function is not case sensitive: "Shrimp" should be treated the same as "shrimp". Note: the allergy passed in will always be lowercase. Hint: the string method .lower() returns a string in which all the characters are lowercase  Example #1: >>> dinnerList = ["Chicken with peanut", "Strawberry Cheesecake", "Peanut Pad Thai"]>>> allergy = "peanut">>> countAllergies(dinnerList, allergy) Expected Output #1: 2  Example #2: >>> dinnerList = ["map tofu", "Tomato egg stir-fry", "Char Siu"]>>> allergy = "egg">>> countAllergies(dinnerList, allergy) Expected Output #2: 1

The following research vignette pertains to  questions 20-25. A study seeks to understand the impact of a stigmatized label (i.e. ADHD) on children's social behavior.  For this study, the following laboratory research situation was set up:  Researchers recruited a total of 40 fifth grade students who were told to complete a task together with another peer. All of the participants were told that the focus of observation was to examine their task performance. One half of the participants were randomly assigned to Condition A which involved students being told that a "peer" (Alex) has been diagnosed with ADHD in the past year (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder--a stigmatizing condition). The other half of participants in Condition B were told that Alex has had an appendix surgery in the past year (a non-stigmatizing condition). Alex, a 5th grader who was actually part of the research team, was instructed to behave in the same way with each participant (Alex was unaware of the purpose of the research). Based on Labeling Theory, the study hypothesis was that children who think that their play partner has ADHD would be less friendly and less cooperative toward their play-partner relative to peers told that the play partner had appendix surgery. Three research assistants were trained on a coding system (codes with definitions) to assess the children's level of friendliness and cooperativeness. Then, they were asked to independently observe the behavior of child participants behind a one-way mirror and code in the following way: Friendliness: (1) friendly (2) somewhat friendly and (3) unfriendly Cooperativeness: (1) cooperative (2) somewhat cooperative and (3) uncooperative --------------------------------------------------- Which of the following is the primary purpose of this research study?

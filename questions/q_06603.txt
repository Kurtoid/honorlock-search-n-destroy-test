Choose one of the following pair of questions and record the option number as your answer below. Option 13.1 (25 points) Derive expressions for [A] and [B] as a function of time for the reaction below starting from the differential rate expressions. Assume that only [A] is present at t=0.     Option 13.2 (30 points) Many polymers are synthesized using the radical-chain polymerization set of reactions. In this problem, you will demonstrate that the consumption of the monomer in this set of reactions has an overall order of 3/2. Radical chain polymerization involves three steps. 1. Initiation, which involves the formation of the radical monomer (

A palindrome is a string that is the same forward and backward. You can use a loop to determine whether a string is a palindrome, and it is also easy to define a palindrome recursively as follows:  A string containing 1 letter is always a palindrome. A string containing 2 or more letters is a palindrome if  Its first and last letters are the same, and The rest of the string (without the first and last letters) is also a palindrome.    Write a java program that prompts for and reads in a string, then print a message saying whether it is a palindrome. Your main method should read the string and call a recursive (static) method palindrome() that takes a string and returns true if the string is a palindrome, false otherwise.   Note: some examples of palindromes are "kayak", "12022021", and "123aba321". In this problem's setting, only numbers and letters are allowed in a palindrome. Your code should be able to handle the exception if the user inputs some other characters such as punctuations or symbols. Any other exception that you can think of must also be elegantly handled in the program.

5. The purpose of this problem is for you to demonstrate your knowledge of generating bivariate normal random variates.  As a reminder, if X1 and X2 are two random variables with a bivariate normal distribution having parameters m1, s1, m2, s2, and r, then      E[X2 | X1=c] = m2 + r (s2/s1) (c-m1)      and        Var(X2 | X1=c) = s2^2 (1 - r^2). Your goal is to generate two correlated normally distributed random variates, U and Z, that have a correlation coefficient of 0.6 and such that the mean and standard deviation of U is 20 and 6, respectively, and the mean and standard deviation of Z is 15 and 6, respectively.  (This is the reason you have Excel available.  Please generate U first.) Assume you have generated two independent random numbers having values 0.246 and 0.468. a.  What is the value for the random variate representing U? [u] b.  What is the value for the random variate representing Z? [z]

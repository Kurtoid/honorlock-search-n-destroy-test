You are taking care of a patient who just delivered by cesarean section. In the recovery room the patient's vital signs are stable, but her respiration rate is 10 breaths/min and her SaO2 is 89%. You call the doctor and give report of the vital signs and you receive an order to administer 10.0 mcg IV of Naloxone HCl every 2-3 minutes until the respiration are is at least 14 breaths/min. The vial of Naloxone HCl you have in your hand contains 0.4 mg/mL. (Numerical value only, round to nearest 100ths if necessary)
Using the bond energies below (kJ/mol), calculate the estimated DH of the reaction pictured below the table. Express your answer in kJ/mol. Screen reader note: "=" is read as a double bond. "identical to" is read as a triple bond. All other bonds are single bonds. End of note.

The genome of a population of plants includes a gene that determines the stature of the plant. This gene has two alleles, and presents two distinct character states. The population consists of 3000 individuals, 2500 of which present the recessive phenotype and 500 that present the dominant phenotype. What is the proportion of each allele? What is the proportion of each genotype? You return 10 years later, and notice that the population has decreased in size and now consists of 2000 individuals. 1700 of the remaining individuals present the dominant phenotype and 300 present the recessive phenotype. What is the proportion of each allele in the new population? What is the proportion of each genotype? Is this population in equilibrium?

Answer the multiple-choice questions over this conditional proof. Keep in mind that on the exam, you would have to construct the whole proof on your own. Use the html box in "Bonus" question 1 to write out the steps to the proof so you can refer back to it when answering the multiple-choice questions.   Note: To show indenting, I put "in 1", "in 2", "in 3" (So indenting three times). Then to step out (discharging the assumption), I put "out 3", "out 2", "out 1". That way we don't need to worry about moving lines in or trying to tab.   Line 12 comes from line 11 and what rule?

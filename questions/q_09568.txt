In a direct calorimetry study, you measure that the total heat production of a growing pig is 12.9 MJ over the 24-h period. You also measure that the total metabolizable energy intake of the pig is 25.2 MJ and body weight gain is 912 g/d over the same 24-h period. 43 POINTS; SHOW YOUR WORK SO I CAN GIVE PARTIAL CREDIT.  Calculate the total net energy for production of the growing pig. You determine that the lean tissue gain of the pig is 667 g/d. Calculate the net energy for protein retention and heat increment for protein retention. Calculate the fat tissue gain of the pig, net energy for fat retention, and heat increment for fat retention.

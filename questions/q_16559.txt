How did Ataturk, Reza Shah, and Ibn Saud establish their country's national identities. What reforms did they implement? Which of the three do you believe overcame the greatest challenge? Why? Make sure you provide detail and analysis from the lectures and the readings to support your claims. 2. Describe U.S. intervention into the Middle East since World War I. Has the United States interventions provided stability to the region? Has U.S. involvement helped the people of the Middle East? Make sure you discuss coups that the U.S. participated in, wars that the U.S. engaged in, and some of the U.S. diplomatic efforts. Make sure you provide detail and analysis from the lectures and the readings to support your claims.

A company is designing an FDD CDMA system for an indoor deployment. The system will use W = 3MHz carriers. The vocoder will operate at a data rate of R = 15kbps.    1. What will the processor gain be for this system in dB?  The equipment for the proposed system will require Eb/N0+I0 = 9dB.    2. What would be the pole capacity (npole) of this system neglecting voicing and interference from neighboring cells?  The voicing factor will be v= 0.5. Since the system is being deployed indoors, there will be interference from cells on floors above and below as well as from the sides. Therefore the interference factor, f, will be taken as 80% ( f= 0.8).    3. What will be the pole capacity of this system if voicing and interference from neighboring cells is included?    4. The equipment manufacturer is releasing new, better equipment for the system and engineers at the company are hoping to be able to reach a pole capacity of npole=40 with this new equipment. What would the minimum Eb/N0+I0 need to be for the new equipment to make this possible (assuming voicing and interference from neighboring cells are the same as for part 3. above)? Give your answer in dB.

Children under 5 years old can be affected by long term exposure to the low level radiation they emit.  The same study showed that cognitive function decreased in males exposed to the rays at all ages.  The study, published in the Journal Nature, has been widely accepted across the scientific community.  The Telecommunications Act authorizes the FCC to "oversee the marketing and labeling requirements for all cellular products sold in the United States."  Intense political pressure by telecommunications giants has kept the issue of the agenda of federal government agencies.   On January 2, 2008, after learning of the studies, Mothers Against Cell Phones (MACP) filed a legislative rulemaking petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requesting that they require a warning label on cell phone packaging that informs consumers of the risks posed to infants and toddlers.  As of January 22, 2012, the FCC had not acted on the petition.   If the FCC adopts the position that existing statutory authority under the Telecommunications Act requires that cell phone companies provide a warning to consumers regarding the risk to young children and that they may issue fines for violations then:

Each generation deleterious mutations enter ever population. In an asexual population there is a real probability that the most fit genotype will be lost due to drift. Hence, asexual populations should acquire more and more deleterious mutations each generation, and once a fit genotype is lost it can't be recreated through recombination.

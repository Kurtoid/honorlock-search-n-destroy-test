A group of researchers conducted a case-control study to investigate if distances to a chemical factory (C point on the map below) associate with lung cancer in a neighborhood. They identified 20 cases (solid dots) from local hospital death certificates, and randomly selected 30 controls (open dots) without lung cancer. In order to examine the effects of distance, they drew three buffers that are 1 mile, 2 miles, 3 miles away from the factory, respectively (dash-line circles).  Figure 1. Distances to a chemical factory  In a sentence or two, interpret each of the odds ratios you calculated from the previous question within this context. Be as specific as possible in your response.

According to the size principle, in which order are motor units recruited in response to increasing synaptic input? S = slow motor units FF = fast fatigable motor units FR = fatigue resistant motor units
A thin hollow spherical shell with a radius of 0.5 m is filled with helium (4He) gas at 1 atm on a day where the temperature is 22oC. A) What mass of the helium gas is in the shell? (5 pts) The shell filled of helium is thrown into a lake (density water = 1000 kg/m3) and it is observed that it sinks until it is completely submerged, and then stops sinking. B) What is the mass of the shell? (5 pts)
Solve the equation. Write your answer(s) in set notation. Show all work! =  -
Compute the probability
Identify the building and the architect.
Find the equation of a rational function of the form   with the following properties:(i) Vertical Asymptote:   (ii) -intercept: (5,0) (iii) Horizontal Asymptote:  . Any correct answer will be given full credit, but you must explain where each piece of your rational function comes from.
Complete the following problems on your own paper. Please use a separate sheet of paper for each problem. You must show your work in order to receive full credit. Correct answers without justification will only receive partial credit. (You do not have to show every step of computation, but I should be able to follow the thought process you used in completing the problem. No notes, calculators, or electronic devices may be used on this quiz. There are 30 possible points on this quiz. Problem 1. (10 points) A spring has a natural length of 2 feet. A 10-pound force is required to stretch the spring to a total length of 3 feet. How much work is required to stretch the spring from its natural length to a length of 5 feet? (Don't forget to include units in your solution.) Problem 2. (10 points) Use the disk/washer method to set up an integral for the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the region under the curve  from  to  .  Problem 3. (10 points) Use the cylindrical shell method to set up an integral for the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the region under the curve  from  to . Hint: Although this is the same solid of revolution as in Problem 2, I recommend drawing a new picture; this may help prevent error. Problem 4. (0 points) You just set up an integral for the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the region under the curve  from  to , using two different methods. If time allows, evaluate the integrals for each problem to verify that both methods gave the same solution. When you are finished, please keep in mind that you should remain in the Zoom session until you have successfully uploaded your quiz to Gradescope.
Which of the following is an example of an intracoronal (direct) restoration?

Gene S controls the sharpness of spines in a type of cactus. Cactuses with the dominant allele, S, have sharp spines, whereas homozygous recessive ss cactuses have dull spines. At the same time, a second gene, N, determines whether or not cactuses have spines. Homozygous recessive nn cactuses have no spines at all.  If doubly heterozygous SsNn cactuses were allowed to self-pollinate, the F2 would segregate in which of the following ratios?

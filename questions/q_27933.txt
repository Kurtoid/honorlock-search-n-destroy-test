High-hardy individuals are likely to __________.
The recording below indicates an ECG waveform on the top channel, heart sounds on the second channel, and digital pulse on the third channel. Recall that pulse wave velocity is based on the time delay between the aortic valve opening and the pulse being detected.  Also, recall that there is no direct indication on this recording of aortic valve opening.  If you assume that the aortic valve opens at the time of peak intensity of the first heart sound (an assumption different than used for the lab worksheet), calculate pulse wave velocity given the distance from the aortic valve to the pulse transducer is 80 cm (as measured along the vascular tree) and the time scale for this recording is 80 msec/div.

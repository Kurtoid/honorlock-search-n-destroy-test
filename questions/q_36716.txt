Two terms that are important in her approach are TOPIC and FOCUS. Briefly define these terms. Then explain how the codeswitching instances in (1) through (3) may be analyzed within this approach. (10 points)   (B) The instances of code-switching in sentences (1) through (3) may be analyzed within Myers-Scotton's Matrix Language Frame (MLF) Model. Explain how, briefly defining the terms you use. (15 points)   (C) As I mentioned earlier, the instances of codeswitching in (1-3) are taken from @MTV. We know by now that codeswitching for this group and their projected audience is the unmarked choice. Briefly explain what this means in terms of the rights-and-obligations set it indexes and in terms of the anticipated cost and reward. (15 points)   (D) Earlier in the program, one of the anchors wishes all the Lebanese and Arabs in general a Happy Adha. Adha is a major Islamic holiday.

You are a licensed psychologist in independent practice. It is the first several weeks of stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the safety of you and your clients, you have decided to transition your fully in-person practice to a virtual format even though you are exempted from the stay-at-home orders due to your role as a healthcare provider. You have been conducting video sessions for the last three weeks, with you in your home and your clients also joining virtual sessions from their home. You have previously stored all of your client files in an encrypted folder on your desktop computer in your office. With the sudden change to remote work, you have not yet transferred those files from the desktop computer in your office. You have started writing your progress notes on your laptop computer for sessions you are conducting online, with the plan to transfer everything (your desktop files and your laptop files) to a cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) system within the next couple weeks so that you have everything you need to work from any location. Currently, however, all you have access to are client emails so that you can send them the link to video sessions and progress notes from sessions that have occurred during the stay-at-home order. You log into the video portal for your session with your 10am client, a 45-year-old White man who lives alone. It has been two weeks since you have had a session with him, and it is your second video session. When you start the session, you immediately see that the client appears dejected and agitated. You start the session by asking what is wrong. He tells you that he was laid off from his job and that he has no idea how he is going to pay his rent after this week. He says that his depression has worsened, he has been having panic attacks, and that his thoughts about suicide have become almost constant. You and this client have previously talked about his suicidal ideation, which prior to the pandemic had been primarily passive thoughts (e.g., "people would be better off if I was dead") with no intent or plan. You do know, however, that he owns multiple firearms that he keeps in the house. You ask your client to tell you more about his recent suicidal thoughts and he says, "My gun is loaded. I have placed it to my head twice today, but then decided I might as well have this session first to say goodbye." Your alarm bells immediately raise, and you ask him for his current address. He refuses to tell you. You ask him for a phone number that you can call him at if you are disconnected from the video call. He refuses to give it to you, and you are now worried that he may hang up the video call any moment.  Discuss this client's risk factors for suicide, both general and proximal. Describe your response to this crisis situation. What do you do next? How do you continue to respond to the crisis situation? Be sure to outline the potential client responses to your interventions and provide details on how you will continue to intervene according to his various potential responses. You could have prevented some of your current predicament by implementing best practices for telemental health from the beginning of your transition to virtual sessions. Discuss the legal and ethical components of best practices for telemental health generally and as they relate to this specific client.

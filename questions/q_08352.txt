A zombie apocalypse wipes out almost the entire human species before the zombie threat is eliminated. Only a group of 100 people who were at a family reunion on an uninhabited island survived. They returned to the mainland completely unaware of what had happened to everyone. Answer the following question regarding the few survivors that now begin to rebuild the human population.Certain traits will have been lost from the gene pool forever. Some may be obvious, like people with red hair or double jointed thumbs. Others will be less obvious, like the ability to process cholesterol or being allergic to peanuts. This loss of diversity in a reduced population is called ________.

A certain system uses two-factor authentication. Let the first method be A1 and the second one  A2. Also, assume that the guessing entropy for A1 is e1 bits and the guessing entropy for A2 is e2 bits.  If A1 and A2 are totally independent (compromise of A1 provides no help is compromising A2 and vice versa), what will be the total entropy of the two-factor method that uses both A1 and A2? (5 pts.)  Now consider the password hardening paper discussed in class. A1 is defined by the user password and A2 is defined by the keystroke timing derived hardening features. In this case, can A1 and A2 be considered independent?  Provide a brief explanation for your answer. (5 pts.)  Sensors these days can also measure the pressure with which a key is pressed. If we add such sensors to keyboards and the password hardening system, we can also define an additional feature based on the pressure measured when each key is pressed. If the password is n characters long, what would be the best case hardening entropy (entropy only due to the keystroke timing and pressure derived features) in this system. (6 pts.)  Assume as users gain more experience typing the same text string, they become faster. Assume Bob is a slow user but his password typing pattern gradually changes and he becomes fast after sufficient number of successful logins.  If  consecutive timing measurements are very close (i.e., gradual change), does the password hardening algorithm adapt to this slow change of timing values and allow Bob to log into the system on each request? (5 pts) If an attacker has knowledge of such user typing behavior, what time is better for the attacker to target Bob's account (early when Bob is slow, late when Bob is fast or in between)? (5 pts)
In France, a committee exists which has the job of eliminating subversive foreign influences in the form of words borrowed from other languages.  English is a major offender (as in le bluejeans or le hamburger).  This is an example of ___________.
UP TO 5 Points EXTRA CREDIT: I want to decompose this large triangle into two smaller right triangles by cutting along the inside vertical line with length 8. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing lengths of my two smaller triangles. The missing length of the smaller triangle on the left is [a]. The missing length of the smaller triangle on the right is [b].

Assume you are a new clinical pharmacist for an inpatient medicine service. You are well integrated into the medical team. While you are rounding with the team, one physician orders a medication whose dose should be adjusted to account for the patient's significant renal dysfunction. After you recommend the dose reduction, the physician tells you she is the prescriber and will use the full dose of the medication despite your recommendation.  You disagree with her decision and state that your interest is ensuring patient safety. Based on the Thomas-Killmann Conflict Mode Instrument, how would you classify the physician's approach to conflict in this situation?

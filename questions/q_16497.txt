In the file Calculator.java, write a class called Calculator that emulates basic functions of a calculator: add, subtract, multiply, divide, and clear. The class has one private member field called value  for the calculator's current value. Implement the following Constructor and instance methods as listed below:  public Calculator() - Constructor method to set the member field to 0.0 public void add(double val) - add the parameter to the member field public void subtract(double val) - subtract the parameter from the member field public void multiply(double val) - multiply the member field by the parameter public void divide(double val) - divide the member field by the parameter public void clear( ) - set the member field to 0.0 public double getValue( ) - return the member field  Given two double input values num1 and num2, the program outputs the following values:  The initial value of the instance field, value The value after adding num1 The value after multiplying by 3 The value after subtracting num2 The value after dividing by 2 The value after calling the clear() method  Ex: If the input is: 10.0 5.0  the output is: 0.0 10.0 30.0 25.0 12.5 0.0 Note: The Main class (with main method) that uses the Calculator class is provided as follows. You only need to implement Calculator class. import java.util.Scanner;public class Main {      public static void main(String[] args) {              Calculator calc = new Calculator();        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);        double num1 = keyboard.nextDouble();        double num2 = keyboard.nextDouble();                // 1. The initial value        System.out.println(calc.getValue());                 // 2. The value after adding num1        calc.add(num1);        System.out.println(calc.getValue());                // 3. The value after multiplying by 3        calc.multiply(3);        System.out.println(calc.getValue());                // 4. The value after subtracting num2        calc.subtract(num2);        System.out.println(calc.getValue());                // 5. The value after dividing by 2        calc.divide(2);        System.out.println(calc.getValue());                // 6. The value after calling the clear() method        calc.clear();        System.out.println(calc.getValue());     }}

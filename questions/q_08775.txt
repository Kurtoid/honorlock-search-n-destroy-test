A deletion mutation in the gene causing Coffin-Lowry syndrome (OMIM303600) was recently identified and mapped on the human X-chromosome.  Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a rare disorder affecting brain morphology and development.  It also produces skeletal and growth abnormalities, as well as, motor control issues.              Coffin-Lowery syndrome affects all males who inherit the mutation on the X chromosome.  Interestingly, most Carrier females show no symptoms of the disease but a few Carriers do.  These Carrier females are always less affected than males. Why might some Carrier females exhibit the disease, but it be less severe than in males? The most probable answer to this observation is that the expression of the disease in females follows the [L1] which results in [L2].

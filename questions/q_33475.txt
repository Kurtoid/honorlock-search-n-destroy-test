On the Excel spreadsheet "Final-Q10", use both Euler's method and Heun's Method to solve the following problem over the interval from x= 0 to 5 with a step size of 0.5. y' = dy/dx = 4*exp(0.8x) - 0.5x. The initial condition y(0) = 2, and the analytical solution is y = 5*exp(0.8x) - 0.25x2 - 3 Which method has the lowest "average % error"? The formula to calculate % error is % error = (numerical - analytical)/analytical * 100 You can find the equations for Euler's Method and Heun's Method on the formula sheet. Note: This is an Excel spreadsheet problem and no programming is required. Once complete, please type a one-word essay (e.g., "ok") for this question and then upload your combined Excel file at the very end of this exam.

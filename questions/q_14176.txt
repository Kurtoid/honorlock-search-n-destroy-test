3.2   Read the following excerpt and answer the questions that follow: Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) is defined as the unexpected and initially unexplained death of infants less than one year old. In 2015 a study was conducted to investigate the presence of mutated cardiac-associated genes in 51 cases of SUDI. Based on the available literature, it is very likely that these genes affect the structures and the functions of the ion-channels in cardiac cells, leading to arrhythmias (abnormal heart rate or rhythm). The study found that in 34% of the cases, one or more cardiac-associated genes were mutated.   The table below shows the ages of the SIDU cases involved in the study:     Age (months)   Cases (amount)     0-2   35     2-4   8     4-6   6     6-8   1     8-10   1     Adapted from: Hertz, C. Et al.

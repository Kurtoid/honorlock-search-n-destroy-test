Directions: Work all the problems below and upload your solutions, including your R code, in a single html file just like you have been doing in your homework. If you cannot generate the html file then do the best you can by uploading a single file that contains your work (Rmd file, text file, ... ). I cannot accept a late submission. The data sets needed are already available in R and don't need to be imported. Each of the problems below is worth 10 points. You may use your notes (written or stored on your computer) for this exam.  Problem 1. The data set faithful provides measurements of the waiting time (waiting) and duration of the eruption (eruptions) for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park. a) Plot the variable waiting (measured in minutes) against the variable eruptions (measured in minutes). Also calculate the least squares regression line and include this line in your scatterplot. b) Interpret the slope. c) Use the prediction equation to predict the waiting time when the time of the last eruption is 3 minutes. d) Calculate the coefficient of determination for this regression and interpret it. Problem 2. The data set chickwts contains measurements made to compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens. Compare the distributions of the weights for the different feed types using density plots. Which feed type would you recommend? Explain. Problem 3. Visualize the relationship between the ambient carbon dioxide concentrations (conc) and carbon dioxide uptake rates (uptake) in the data set CO2 with a scatterplot where you color the printing character according to the levels of the factor Treatment. Problem 4. The function below generates a random number. Random.number
List as many monastic groups/orders as you can recall (10 points)
Determine the limiting reactant (LR) and the mass (in g) of nitrogen that can be formed from 40.0 g N2O4 and 35.0 g N2H4.  Some possibly useful molar masses are as follows:  N2O4 = 92.02 g/mol, N2H4 = 32.05 g/mol.             N2O4(l) + 2 N2H4(l)  -  3 N2(g) + 4 H2O(g)
Please write about what you want to do after graduation. I think it is really important to consider. When I graduated, I did not have a clear idea of what I wanted to do. I am sure you feel the same (some might not. I am sorry). However, I kept thinking and thinking about myself and my future and then I decided to do what I am doing now. You can write random things and anything you think about. No pressure.  (Max. 500 words)

Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a large, highly integrated complex containing many copies of three distinct enzymes and several coenzymes involved in its catalytic activity. The coenzymes can be classified depending on how they participate in an enzymatic reaction. A coenzyme prosthetic group is tightly bound to the enzyme and remains bound during the catalytic cycle. The original coenzymes are regenerated during the catalytic cycle. On the other hand, a coenzyme cosubstrate is loosely bound to an enzyme and dissociates in an altered form as part of the catalytic cycle. Its original form is regenerated not by the cycle, but by another enzyme. Name the coenzymes of pyruvate dehydrogenase and note whether they are prosthetic groups or cosubstrates of PDH.

Problem 4a) Finite State Machines Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner. The tool bar has indent functions. In 4a), 4b), and 4c)  we will write a finite state machine (FSM) named FSM010 for the problem defined. It will find the sequence 010 embedded in an arbitrary sequence of bits wherever it occurs (use variable x), overlapping. Generate an output Z=2'd1 whenever this sequence is detected, otherwise Z=2'd0. Use a standard Finite state machine design organized in problem 4 parts a), b), and c) which is below. Inputs must be x, reset, clk, and outputs must be State, and Z.  A state transition table (which contains the same information as a state diagram) is supplied.  In this problem 4a) write   the module statement,  a localparam statement that does a state assignment, and  any declarations of local variables.   Be complete. You can look forward to 4b) and 4c) to see the entire problem if that helps. For maximum credit your code should carefully follow the specification, and your grade will depend that. Use the minimum number of lines to accomplish this specification. Use System Verilog, always_ff, and always_comb, and don't use reg datatype. Also use proper indentation for organization.

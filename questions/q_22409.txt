Worldviews:  What is the best explanation of things like pleasure from orgasms, shame, guilt, volitions, and other mental states associated with sex?  One of the major problems Naturalists (scientific atheists) have had in the last 100 years is to explain why anything is conscious or awake and having mental states.  Feelings like shame and guilt and desires to procreate (and experience orgasms) and sensations of pleasure, as well as "willings" or acts of volition, are all mental states that humans experience and describe regularly.  Personal Theists are dualists (like Plato and Aristotle) and so immaterial or non-physical mental states can be explained by the existence of a non-physical/immaterial mind or soul or Self (that God may or may not have created).  Therefore, with God and souls in their "ontological toolboxes", they do not have the problems of the Naturalist (scientific atheist) in explaining the existence of mental states.  What is the main reason why most Naturalists (scientific atheists) are physicalists and committed to believing everything about human beings is physical (and explained by sciences such as molecular neurobiology and, ultimately, chemistry and physics)?

Enter the pitches for an ascending B major scale.  Use letter names, where "#" is a sharp, "b" is a flat, "x" is a double sharp, "bb" is a double flat. So G-flat would be entered "Gb" (no spaces between accidentals or pitches). A note with a "natural" is just the letter name, so D natural = "D" Example: Do - re - mi (etc) Ascending:  B | - [re] - [mi] - [fa] - [sol] - [la] - [ti] - B

Dr. Freeman  ORIGINAL hypothesis:  Participants will remember nonsense words that resemble English words better (e.g. COS) than consonant-only nonsense words (e.g. CFD) and this difference will be bigger when there are no distractions during encoding than when there are distractions.  Participants will be randomly assigned to either a condition where the words resemble English words or are nonsense words. Then half of the participants in each word groups will be distracted while the words are presented while the other half are not. Suppose the DR. Freeman  ran her study again but this time  compared how Word type  (same conditions as original) influenced recall in the following distraction conditions: No distraction, moderate visual distraction, High visual distraction, moderate auditory distraction, high auditory distraction.

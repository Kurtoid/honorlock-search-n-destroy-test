AFDELING B VRAAG 3     3.1   Lees die onderstaande teks en antwoord die vrae wat volg.           Longkanker is een van die grootste oorsake van kankersterftes onder Suid-Afrikaanse mans, en dit is ook die algemeenste kanker wereldwyd.  In Suid-Afrika is longkanker die derde algemeenste kanker by mans en die vyfde grootste kanker by vroue, wat diagnose behels. Die hoofoorsaak van longkanker is tabakrook, en die risiko neem toe met die aantal sigarette wat gerook word en hoe lank die persoon al rook. Ongeveer 60% van alle sterftes aan longkanker in Suid-Afrika is as gevolg van tabakrook, en meer as 8% van alle sterftes is as gevolg van rook.  Meer as 44 000 Suid-Afrikaners sterf jaarliks   aan tabakverwante siektes, wat longkanker insluit.  Ander bekende oorsake van longkanker sluit in die inasem van tweedehandse tabakrook, asook huishoudelike en industriele besoedeling. Baie longkankers begin in die selle wat die binnekant van die longe uitvoer  en word die karsinoom van die brongus (bronchogene karsinoom) genoem. Karsinogeniese (kankerveroorsakende) stowwe wat in sigaretrook voorkom, is die oorsaak van die meeste longkankers, emfiseem, brongitis en chroniese obstruktiewe longsiektes. Swaar rook is ongetwyfeld 'n groot oorsaaklike faktor in die ontwikkeling van longkanker. Waarskuwingstekens:  Chroniese hoes. Toenemende uitasem wees. Hoes bloedbevlekte slym op. Dowwe of skerp pyn as jy hoes of diep asemhaal. Verlies van eetlus en gewigsverlies.

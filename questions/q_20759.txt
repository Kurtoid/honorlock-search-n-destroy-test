Did you show a 360 degree view of your room AND show your desktop during the room scan?  If not, do it NOW! Maximize the testing window!  You should not see anything on the computer except the test and testing materials.  Please take a moment, before you start the test, and show your webcam that both sides of each sheet of scratch paper are blank, even if you showed it during your environment video.  Once this is complete, please click on the Desmos Calculator link and the Conversion Sheet link and give a thumbs up to the camera that both links opened.  Please keep both of these tabs open through the entire test (don't "x" out of them), it saves time.  To get back and forth between the table/calculator and the test, tap the Alt & Tab buttons together.  If either link doesn't open immediately, please try to refresh that page/tab.  If either link does not open properly, please submit the test immediately and contact Mrs. Conderman (do NOT look at or work on the test).  This is unlikely, but it would fall under "technical difficulties" and you will not be penalized for following these directions. Thank you!   To get back and forth between the table/calculator and the test, hold the Alt button & tap the Tab button.  You may also need to click the screen you want with the mouse.

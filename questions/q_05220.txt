Read the poem (used for all poetry questions) and answer the question that follows.

I have seen roses damasked, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.

And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare      As any she belied with false compare.   What is the meter of the poem?

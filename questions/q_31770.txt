Energy is transferred to the system by heat transfer from a thermal reservoir at 900degR until the temperature of the air is 1000degR. During the process, the temperature of the system boundary where the heat transfer occurs is 1200degR. Using the ideal gas model, determine the amount of entropy produced, in Btu/degR.

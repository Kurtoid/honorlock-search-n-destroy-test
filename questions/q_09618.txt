Please update the finished exam .java files to the exam turnin spot.   Programming Final (100 points) Rules: You must complete this without talking or chatting or emailing other people or communicating with other people in any other way. Cell phones / other devices are not allowed. You may direct message me on discord for any clarifications. Part 1 (25 points) Create the following application. There are no restrictions as to what types of components/panes you can use. It should be 500 by 400. None of the buttons do anything. The radio buttons must be configured so only one of them can be selected (but, they otherwise don't have to do anything). Your program must compile and run.        Part 2 (75 points) Given a Java file that contains a layout (Java file found at bottom), you will be adding some functionality. You will also need to modify the existing code. Currently, here is what is displayed:    Modify it to do the following:  Read from a file "data.txt".  In the file are 64 0s and 1s mapping to the 8 by 8 buttons. If it is a 0, then the button should disappear (but not affect the layout of the other buttons). The top left number maps to the top left button, the top right number maps to the top right button, etc. The code for reading this file should be inside of its own method. This method should be called as the program is initializing.Example file contents and the display with this file:    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 11 1 1 1 1 1 1 11 1 1 1 1 1 1 11 1 1 1 1 0 1 11 1 1 1 1 0 1 11 1 1 1 1 1 1 11 1 1 1 1 1 1 11 1 1 1 1 1 1 1       Color the button at 2,2 to be green. (2,2 will not be blank in whatever file you are given). Color the other buttons yellow. (Other color schemes are fine too as long as there are two different colors).  Note: Once you have set the color of all the buttons, the buttons will not highlight or look like they are pressed down when they are pressed down. This is expected.          When a yellow button is pressed, if the pressed button is one of the 4 diagonal neighbors of the green button, make this the "active" button - color the pressed button to green and the previously green one to yellow. If it is not one of the 4 diagonals, do nothing.  In the following picture, if you press on the green square's upper-left yellow button, the following change should occur.        /* starting file */   import java.util.*;import java.text.*;import java.io.*;import java.lang.*;import javafx.application.*;import javafx.event.*;import javafx.stage.*;import javafx.scene.canvas.*;import javafx.scene.paint.*;import javafx.scene.*;import javafx.scene.input.*;import javafx.scene.layout.*;import javafx.animation.*;import javafx.scene.control.*;import javafx.scene.image.*;import java.net.*;import javafx.geometry.*;public class FinalLayout extends Application{   GridPane theGrid = new GridPane();   FlowPane root = new FlowPane();   Label victoryLabel = new Label("Game is playing!

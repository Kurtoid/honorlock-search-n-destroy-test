The fifteen questions in this exam are based on the following information (repeated in each question for your convenience):Kimbeth Manufacturing uses process costing to control costs in the manufacture of Dust Sensors for the mining industry. The following information pertains to operations for November.   The beginning inventory was 40% complete as to materials and 30% complete as to conversion costs. The ending inventory was 20% complete as to materials and 70% complete as to conversion costs.Costs pertaining to November are as follows:Beginning inventory: direct materials, $20,930; conversion costs, $ 13,750. Costs incurred during the month: direct materials, $182,000; conversion costs, $ 222,040.(For your convenience: Total costs to be accounted for=20,930+13,750+182,000+222,040=$ 438,720)Q14. What is the total cost of the units transferred to finished goods inventory, assuming Kimbeth uses WEIGHTED-average process costing (round cost per equivalent unit for both DM and conversion cost up to two digits (i.e., as in previous answers) before calculations)?

The physical fitness of a patient is often measured by the patient's maximum oxygen uptake (which is recorded in milliliters per kilogram, ml/kg). The mean maximum oxygen uptake for cardiac patients who regularly participate in sports was found to be 24.1 ml/kg, with a standard deviation of 6.3 ml/kg. Assume that this distribution is approximately normal. For each part, provide a shaded sketch that is labeled appropriately as part of your answer. Answers without appropriate support will not receive credit. Use correct notation and rounding.  Find the probability that a cardiac patient who regularly participates in sports has a maximum oxygen uptake of less than 34 ml/kg. [blank1] Find the probability that a cardiac patient who regularly participates in sports has a maximum oxygen uptake of greater than 18 ml/kg. [blank2] Find the probability that a cardiac patient who regularly participates in sports has a maximum oxygen uptake between 22 ml/kg and 32 ml/kg. [blank3]

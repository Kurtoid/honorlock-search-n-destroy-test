22)  When Anderson was growing up, all of the members of his family, and most of the people in the town he lived, very commonly used a number of racial slurs.  Like the people around him, Anderson also very commonly used those slurs. When Anderson went away to college, he was exposed to new people and he realized how hurtful the use of those slurs can be.  He thus completely stopped using them.  Anderson is now 40 years old.  When he thinks back to himself at age 13, he remembers himself knowing the use of those slurs was completely wrong and he remembers himself almost never using them himself.         Anderson's inaccurate memory of himself at age 13 illustrates what memory issue?

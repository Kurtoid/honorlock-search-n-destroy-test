A 12 V permanent magnet dc starting motor for a gasoline engine is geared to the engine flywheel through a 5:1 speed reducer. The rotational moment of inertia of the engine is 10.0 kg*m2, and the friction constant is 0.5 Nxmxsec.  Neglect any load other mechanical losses. The starting motor produces a torque of 0.8 N*m per ampere of armature current.  The starting motor's armature circuit resistance is 0.1  and its rotational moment of inertia is negligible.   Assume that the armature electrical time constant of the motor is neglected. If a 12 V dc voltage supply is connected to the armature at time t=0, calculate the amount of time, t, required for the engine to reach a speed of 10 rad/sec from standstill. Now suppose that the armature inductance is NOT neglected, and La = 120 mH.  Determine the roots (or poles) of the characteristic equation of the motor response to a change in vt, as in part a).

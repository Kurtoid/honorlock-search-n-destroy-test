B: Describe chemical synaptic transmission beginning at the triggering of an action potential, to the clearance of a neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft (at least two mechanisms). Be explicit about which kinds of channels are involved.  C: Two axon inputs synapse onto a CA1 neuron. Describe an experiment to induce long-term potentiation and long-term depression: What happens under normal conditions (i.e., stimulation of axon 1 and its impact on the postsynaptic neuron). What happens to this synapse following LTP or LTD. Has the synapse of axon 2 been altered? What is ultimately required for LTP or LTD to occur?   D: Describe 2 experiments that demonstrate that the hippocampus and its associated structures are important in memory and spatial navigation. One experiment should describe physiological responses of hippocampal neurons. One experiment should describe a behavioral task E: Describe why the quality of maternal care can lead to susceptibility or resilience to stress in their offspring.

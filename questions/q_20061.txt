Many people sleep in on weekends to make up for all-nighters during the work week. The Better Sleep Council reports that 61% of us get more than seven hours of sleep per night on the weekend. A random sample of 350 adults found that 235 had more than seven hours of sleep each night last weekend. Does this evidence show that more than 61% of people sleep seven or more hours per night on the weekend?  Answer the following parts on your own paper and submit a pdf of your work to this question. If Canvas misbehaves, send your work as an attachment via Canvas mail within 15 minutes of closing the exam.     Identify and define the parameter of interest. State the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses, in both words and in symbols. Check the technical conditions. Calculate the test statistic. Include a sketch of a labelled and shaded normal curve. Determine the p-value. Make a decision and write a conclusion in context. Would the p-value have been larger, smaller, or the same if a larger sample size had been used and all else turned out the same? (Do not bother to explain.) Would the p-value have been larger, smaller, or the same if the level of significance used had been smaller and all else turned out the same? (Do not bother to explain.)

Which of the following views say that reduced birthrates must come first and then higher per capita income will follow:
You collect data at a lek and notice that a single male obtains over 70% of the matings that occur there. When he is experimentally removed, a male that had previously had low mating success moves in to take over the display ground of the removed male, and that replacement male subsequently has much higher mating success than he had previously. What hypothesis best explains this observation?

Utilitarianism can be broken into two sub-theories: Act and Rule. Act utilitarianism says we should do whatever action will create the most happiness for the most people. Example: I should murder someone if it will bring a lot of people a lot of happiness.   Rule utilitarianism says we should follow rules that generally create happiness and generally don't cause pain, even if in isolated instances they don't maximize happiness. Everyone following the rules creates more happiness than if everyone followed act utilitarianism. Example: I should tell the truth in situation x even if a lie would create more happiness. True or False?

For each of the three cytoskeletal systems (microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments) answer the following 5 questions...each answer is worth 1 points, and should only need 1-4 words for each.   A Microtubules: A1       what is the structural building block used to make the polymer in a cell? A2       What nucleotide is bound to the structural building block listed above? A3       Once the polymer is made in  cells, does the polymer have polarity? A4       What motor proteins (if any) move along the polymer? A5       In what direction (s) do the motors above move?   B Intermediate filaments: B1       what is the structural building block used to make the polymer in a cell? B2       What nucleotide is bound to the structural building block listed above? B3       Once the polymer is made in  cells, does the polymer have polarity? B4       What motor proteins (if any) move along the polymer? B5       In what direction (s) do the motors above move?   C Microfilaments: C1       what is the structural building block used to make the polymer in a cell? C2       What nucleotide is bound to the structural building block listed above? C3       Once the polymer is made in  cells, does the polymer have polarity? C4       What motor proteins (if any) move along the polymer? C5       In what direction (s) do the motors above move?

A secretion from this organ will raise the pH of the small intestine and neutralize the stomach acid.
Based on the given data, which of the following is true?
The following are the main steps in the generation of an action potential. What is the proper sequence of these events?  Sodium channels are inactivated. Voltage-gated potassium channels open and potassium moves out of the cell, initiating repolarization. Sodium channels regain their normal properties. A graded depolarization brings an area of an excitable membrane to threshold. A temporary hyperpolarization occurs. Sodium channel activation occurs. Sodium ions enter the cell and depolarization occurs.

ABC Associates is a general partnership.  The partners orally agree that they will work full time for the partnership and will distribute profits based on their capital contributions.  Able contributed $5,000, Baker $10,000 and Charlie $15,000.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, ABC had profits of $60,000 that were distributed to the partners.  During 2020, ABC was operating at a loss and in September, 2020, the partnership was dissolved - neither constructive nor actual notice was given to outsiders. In October, 2020, Charlie contracted in writing with A-1 Cars to purchase a car for the partnership and had previously dealt with A-1 for the partnership.  ABC did not honor the contract and now A-1 seeks to hold the partnership and the individual partners liable.  Choose the correct statement.  Able's share of ABC Associates profits for the year 2019 would be $20,000 Charlie's share of ABC Associates profits for 2019 would be $30,000

Fleur was surprised to learn that Paget Disease of Bone (PDB) was more common than expected in this clinic. One 45 yo female patient was known to the clinic because she had been there several times, presenting with breaks in her fragile bones. Fleur found it very interesting that this patient had different stages of PDB going on in her spine, pelvis, skull and legs at the same time.  PDB could be described most thoroughly as a disorder that causes:

Judges decided that there was evidence of fraud. They found that correction fluid had been used to change votes and many were unsigned. The existing president Mutharika received 38.57% of votes and his main opponent, Lazarus Chakwera, got 35.41%. it was claimed that more than 1.4 million votes out of 5.1 million were affected by fraud. The president, who was standing for re-election, was also president of the electoral commission which ran the election. The commission failed to manage the election properly because it had not noticed the abuse of power. The country's anti-corruption body arrested a top businessman for apparently trying to bribe the five judges hearing the case.

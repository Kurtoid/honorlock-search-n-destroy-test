You started Mr. Doe on HCTZ 4 weeks ago.  Mr. Doe returns to the clinic for a follow-up visit 4 weeks later. He states he is tolerating the medication you prescribed well and denies any adverse effects. He reports he has been under a lot of stress at work and has not been adhering to his diet and exercise plan. He denies any weight gain, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or weakness. Mr. Doe brings his blood pressure log with him today. BP readings are as follows: AM: 138/90 PM: 140/90 AM: 146/88 PM: 142/90 AM: 142/86 PM: 145/88 VS in office today: Temp 98.deg7 F, BP 142/88, HR 82, RR 18, 02 Sat 100% Repeat labs are unremarkable. What is the next step in the treatment of Mr. Doe's hypertension?  Correct Answer: Continue Mr. Doe's antihypertensive therapy since he is tolerating it well and add a second medication from a different class. Rationale to Case study question: Mr. Doe's blood pressure is still not a goal, so we would want to modify the current treatment plan. Mr. Doe is not presenting with symptoms of hypertensive emergency which is defined as a blood pressure >180/120 mm Hg with evidence of pending end-organ damage. Per JNC-8 guidelines, the next step in Mr. Doe's treatment plan would be to either 1) Maximize current medication,  2) Add a second medication, or 3) Prescribe a fixed-dose combination drug. Stopping the current medication is not indicated at this time.

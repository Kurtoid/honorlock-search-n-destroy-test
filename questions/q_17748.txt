Skrillex Company manufactures computer circuit cards and uses a process costing system.   All direct materials are added at the beginning of the production process and there are no conversion costs.   For November, there was no beginning WIP, 8,000 cards were started, 7,000 cards were completed, 350 cards were spoiled as expected (normal), and ending WIP of 650 cards were 100% complete with respect to direct material costs.   Spoilage is detected when the production process is 100% complete.   Direct material costs added to production during November totaled $100,000. What is the total production cost (in dollars) assigned to 'normal spoilage' for November? You may use either the weighted-average or FIFO method to determine your response.  Round interim and final dollar amounts to two (2) decimal places (e.g., $107.6457 would be $107.65).

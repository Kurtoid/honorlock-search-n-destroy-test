A teratoma is a tumor composed of several different types of tissue that can include muscle, teeth, hair, or bone. Teratomas develop from germ cells, a type of cell that gives rise to gametes. Because germ cells are not differentiated into specific cell types (as are e.g. muscle cells, skin cells, fat cells, etc.), teratomas can develop exhibiting numerous different cell types, giving them their name teratoma, Greek for "monstrous tumor". Teratomas may be benign or cancerous. As a result of mistakes in processes of cell division, they are generally diploid, and sometimes polyploid. Consider a cell of a teratoma and a healthy human epithelial (skin) cell. Now consider the DNA and the three types of RNA (mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA) found in both. For each of these (DNA, mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA), compare what you would expect to find in both a teratoma and a healthy cell. Would they be the same, or different, or both? Please explain briefly but clearly for each of these four nucleic acids and provide examples or reasons. 1) DNA 2) mRNA 3) tRNA 4) rRNA  Photo credits: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/281850-overview (left) and Ed Uthman, MD. http://web2.airmail.net/uthman/specimens/index.html (right)

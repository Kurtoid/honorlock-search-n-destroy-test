Calculate DG at 25degC for the precipitation of lead(II) chloride from mixing 100. mL of 0.080 M lead(II) nitrate solution with 100. mL of 0.080 M sodium chloride solution. The DGdeg for the reaction at 25degC = -27.36 kJ/mol.  (Hint: write out reaction equation - also, consider total solution volume)

Regression is often used in health research to help determine the social and economic indicators that lead to certain health problems.  You wish to understand some of the factors that lead to Cirrhosis of the liver.  You have a dataset, where each item is a US state.  The variables are as follows: Independent Variables SizeUrban: the size of the urban population, Birth45to49: the number of births to women between 45 to 49 (actually, the reciprocal of that value, times 100) ConsWine: the consumption of wine per capita, ConsLiquor: the consumption of hard liquor per capita, Dependent Variable Cirrhosis: the death rate from cirrhosis. You wish to test whether or not there is multicollinearity in your data.  You run the following code.  a) Does this give output evidence of multicollinearity? Why? Give reference to either values of VIF or tolerance? b) In general, how can you predict if two independent variables are collinear using a scatterplot?

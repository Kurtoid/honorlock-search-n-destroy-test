Find the current for R2 of the circuit below.  You must perform a delta-to-wye or wye-to-delta conversion on a portion of this circuit. You must determine which portion to convert.  Complete the following steps to show your work.  It is required to organize your work clearly.  A.) State which resistors you have selected, and which type of conversion you are going to perform. B.) Enter your calculations for the conversion, using the "Insert Math Equation" tool.  C.) Write an explanation of all the resistor relationships in the new circuit.   For example, R1 is in parallel with R2.  That combination is in series with R3.  The following combination is in parallel with R4...etc.  D.) Calculate the total resistance of the new circuit.  Each step of your calculation must be shown. E.) Find the current for R2 of the original circuit.   Your work, including all calculations, must be typed into the answer box below.   Use the "Insert Math Equation" function.  Answers without an adequate explanation or work/calculations will receive little to no points.
Convert to following to degrees:    p5{"version":"1.1","math":"p5"}      and      6
Prior to your routine quarterly health check visit to an 800-sow farrow-to-finish farm, you notice that preweaning mortality was up slightly last week as compared to the normal level (12% for the week versus 8-9% normally). While you recognize that this may represent normal biological variation, you take note of the increase. During the farm visit, you notice that some of the breeding animals, primarily in the farrowing rooms but some in gestation, have blisters and vesicles on their snout and around their mouths and hooves. The correct course of action is to:
Antibody found in secretions such as breast milk and saliva.
Suppose an experiment is conducted to test the accuracy of a drug test intended to track the usage of a particular illegal recreational drug.   Among 138 subjects with positive test results, there are 18 false positive results.  Among 148 negative results, there are 4 false negative results.     If one of the subjects is randomly selected, find the probability that the subject tested positive or actually used the recreational drug.  Round your answer to three decimal places.

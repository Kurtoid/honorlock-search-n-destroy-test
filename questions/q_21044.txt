The formula to compute the kinetic energy is equal to (1/2)mv2, where m is the mass in kilograms, v is the velocity in meters/second and energy is given in Joules. Your job will be to write a program that gets the mass and velocity from the keyboard, call a function, that takes in as parameters the mass and velocity, to compute and return the kinetic energy.  The main program will then display that energy using one decimal place. The function should return 0 if the mass or the velocity are not positive numbers. Otherwise, it should use the formula given above and return that computed value. Provide a complete Go solution.

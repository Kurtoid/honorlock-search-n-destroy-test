A facility has a comprehensive fire response system that includes a fire detection system (FDS; 1st line of defense), an automatic fire alarm system (2nd line of defense), an automatic facility sprinkler system (3rd line of defense), and personnel evacuation plan/procedures (4th line of defense). The automatic fire alarm and sprinkler systems are only triggered when the detection system senses the presence of fire. They are not triggered if the FDS fails.   Apply the following event and probability information for an ETA: Initiating Event (IE) - "Fire" (Probability (Fire) = 0.01) "FDS Operates Properly" (1-p=0.90) "Fire Alarm System Activates" (1-p=0.70) "Facility Sprinkler System Activates" (1-p=0.80) "Personnel Evacuate Facility Safely" (1-p=0.75)   Match the appropriate event descriptions to the labels in the event tree diagram.

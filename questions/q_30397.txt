A 1.0L buffer solution contains 0.100M HC2H3O2 and 0.100M NaC2H3O2.  Calculate the pH of the solution after the addition of 10.0mL of 1.00M HCl to the buffer.  Ka for HC2H3O2 = 1.8 x 10-5   Equations: pH = -log [H3O+] pOH = -log [OH-] pH + pOH = 14.00 Kw = 1.00 x 10-14 at 25oC Kw = Ka x Kb = [H3O+] [OH-] pKa = -log Ka pH = pKa + log

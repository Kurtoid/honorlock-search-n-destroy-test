2- How does rainfall cause slope failure? (4 points) 3- Name 2 models of slope failure. (2 points) 4- An infinite slope (shown in the figure) is to be analyzed assuming that the failure surface is planar and parallel to the slope face. Mark ALL the forces (with directions) acting on a representing element ABCD using the notations used in class. If you are using notations other than the ones used in class, you must clearly define them. (6 points)   5- Sketch Standard Proctor curve, Modified Proctor curve and zero air void (ZAV) curve in a single plot and clearly mark the maximum dry density and optimum moisture content for the standard and modified proctor curves. (6 points)   6.    For the finite slope shown in the figure below (not to scale), calculate equilibrium shear stress and shear strength on the failure plane and then calculate the factor of safety of the slope for the assumed failure plane. Assume W=7000 kN/m; and the water table is well below the toe of the slope. (30points)    7.     A sand cone test has been performed in a compacted fill. The test results are as follows:Initial mass of sand cone apparatus= 5.912 kgFinal mass of sand cone apparatus= 2.378 kgMass of soil recovered from hole= 2.883 kgMoisture content of soil from hole= 7%Density of sand= 1300 kg/m3Volume of cone below valve= 1.114x10-3 m3The project specifications require a relative compaction of at least 90% based on the standard Proctor test.

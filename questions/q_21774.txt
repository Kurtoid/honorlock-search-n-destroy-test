Use this table for all subparts of this question.     t         0 0.25 6.14% 0.985   0 0.50 6.40% 0.969   0 0.75 6.96% 0.950   0 1.00 6.72% 0.936   0 1.25 7.69% 0.910   0 1.50 6.84% 0.904   0 1.75 6.90% 0.888   0 2.00 7.09% 0.870    An investor construct a bond portfolio as below. Assume that the face value of each bond is $100.    Portfolio Position A: 2 million units of 2-year coupon bonds paying 12% annually Position B: 1 million units of 1-year floating rate bonds with a 500 basis point spread paid semiannually Position C: 3 million units of 2-year zero coupon bonds The investor's main concern is the change in interest rates that might a affect the short-term value of the portfolio.   (a) Compute the duration and convexity of each security (position) Position A.       Duration: [answer1]      Convexity: [answer2] Position B.       Duration: [answer3]      Convexity: [answer4] Position C.       Duration: 2      Convexity: 4   (b) What are the duration and convexity of the portfolio? Portfolio      Duration: [answer5]      Convexity: [answer6]   (c) How much would this investor lose (in million dollars) if interest rate goes up by 2%? Compute the change in value of portfolio stemming from duration plus convexity.  answer: [answer7] millions   (d) Due to a series of unfortunate events, the investor just found out that he must raise $500 million. The investor decides to short-sell the 2-year zero coupon bonds to raise the $500 million. In other words, the investor would spend the same amount of money on all securities except for the 2-year zero coupon bonds. What is the dollar duration of the new portfolio?(Hint: As a consequence, the final position in the 2-year zero coupon bond is the initial investment in Position C minus $500 millions.) Dollar duration of the new portfolio: [answer8]   (e) On February 1, 2020, a company called "XYZ" issued Floating Rate Notes (FRNs) with the face value of $100 and time to maturity of 2 years (semiannually paid, without spreads). Three months have passed since the issuance and today is May 1, 2020 (t = 0.25). Suppose that you have been endowed with money and suddenly become interested in purchasing "XYZ"'s FRNs issued 3-months ago. What is the price of the FRN (per 1-unit) today? On May 1, 2020, you observe the following term structure of interest rates. (Note that the term structure on February 1, 2020 is already given above).     t       0.25 0.50 8.25% 0.980   0.25 0.75 8.33% 0.960   0.25 1.00 9.16% 0.935   0.25 1.25 8.51% 0.920   0.25 1.50 9.07% 0.895   0.25 1.75 8.08% 0.888   0.25 2.00 8.12% 0.870   0.25 2.25 8.29% 0.850    What is the price of FRN on May 1, 2020?  [answer9] What is the amount of coupon ($C) that you will be receiving on Aug 1, 2020?  [answer10]

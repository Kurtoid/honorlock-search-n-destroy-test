Use the following scenario to answer the next five questions:Lenora and Uma own a dog-grooming business in upstate New York, called Pawkeepsie Groomers. There are many buyers and many sellers in the dog-grooming service market. Pawkeepsie Groomers experiences normal cost curves, with the marginal cost (MC) curve crossing average variable cost (AVC) at $14 and average total cost (ATC) at $22.If a firm is producing a quantity of 150 and charging a price of $13, it
A thin uniform rod (length = 1.2 m, mass = 2.0 kg) is pivoted about a horizontal, frictionless pin through one end of the rod. (The moment of inertia of the rod about this axis is ML2/3.) The rod is released when it makes an angle of 37deg with the horizontal. What is the angular acceleration of the rod at the instant it is released?

A researcher conducts an experiment to determine the relative effectiveness of three medications designed to control LDL cholesterol levels in female patients with moderate-to-high cholesterol levels. Patients are recruited and randomly assigned to take one of the three medications over a 6-month period. At the end of the study, the LDL cholesterol level of each patient is measured. The researcher is concerned about the impact of the overall health of the patients on their LDL cholesterol levels; therefore, the body mass index (BMI) of each patient is also recorded as a covariate. SPSS was used to conduct an analysis of covariance (all underlying assumptions were checked and found to be valid). The tables below provide a portion of the SPSS output. Use the tables (as needed) to answer this question.  Table 6A      Table 6B         Do the following:  State the null and alternative hypotheses for the analysis of covariance test, make a decision about the null hypothesis, and write a conclusion statement. If appropriate, use the Bonferroni post hoc analysis to identify all pairs of adjusted treatment means that are statistically significantly different. Justify your conclusions.

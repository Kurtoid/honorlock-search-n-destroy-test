Module 06 - Emotion Regulation: Question: Cyntrice's consultant is training her to use a ______ strategy during pre-performance contexts.  Cyntrice's Affect Regulation Back Story: Cyntrice, the Bantamweight Mixed Martial Artist (MMA) and her coach recently hired a Sport Psychology Consultant to help her achieve an optimal affective state during pre-performance, active performance, and post-performance contexts. The Sport Psychology Consultant proposed the following interventions:  Pre-performance: During multiple sessions in an office and in the gym, Cyntrice's consultant instructs her to think of her upcoming performance as opportunities to demonstrate her elite skill set, her focused anger, and opportunistic power. Instead of Cyntrice thinking of her anger as a source of unlimited power and energy, her consultant wants her to think of her anger as only being effective when it is directed towards a focused cause. Active-performance: Over several weeks, Cyntrice's consultant has her coach increase the similarity of training sessions to an actual competitive bout. Importantly, the consultant wants these sessions to increase Cyntrice's exposure to a higher volume and higher intensity of anger inducing stimuli.  Post-performance: Cyntrice's consultant sets up equipment that will measure Cyntrice's heart-rate, respiration rate, and cortisol levels. The consultant provides the data to Cyntrice and wants her to use this information to work on actively controlling her arousal level; calming herself down in the moments immediately following a performance and throughout her recovery period.

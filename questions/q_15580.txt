The consultant's fee was to be paid upon the son's successful admission to any school on a predetermined list of highly ranked universities. When the son's applications were approximately two-thirds complete, the consultant suddenly decided to get out of the consulting business and abruptly assigned "all rights and duties under any of my existing consulting contracts" to one of his competitors.

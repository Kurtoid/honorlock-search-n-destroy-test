Andy is the owner of Andy's Bistro.  He is most proud of his sourdough bread recipe, which he credits for his restaurant's great success.  One day, he calls a meeting of his entire staff (including wait staff, chefs, hosts, and accountants) and shares with them the recipe for the bread "because it's so good I want you all to benefit from knowing it."

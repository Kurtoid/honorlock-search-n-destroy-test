There are many reasons why students become interested in applying to the respiratory program at Broward College.  Some students search the internet and find the job availability after graduation.  Some students do a career search to determine what would be the best fit for their personality and academic strengths. Once these students decide on respiratory care, they compare respiratory programs to find the top notch program.  Some students did not get accepted into other health science programs and have decided to try another avenue of getting into the health care profession.  Whatever the reason, once they are in the program, success is usually not predicted by the grades they received in their prerequisite courses.

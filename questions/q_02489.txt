7. Use the figure and the following description to answer the questions below: In a particular plant, leaf color is controlled by gene locus D. Plants with at least one allele D have dark green leaves, and plants with the homozygous recessive dd genotype have light green leaves. A true-breeding, dark-leaved plant is crossed with a light-leaved one, and the F1 offspring is allowed to self-pollinate. The predicted outcome of the F2 is diagrammed in the Punnett square shown in the figure, where 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the genotypes corresponding to each box within the square. a. Which of the boxes marked 1-4 correspond to plants that will be true-breeding? Support your answer with an explanation. b. If one offspring is light greened leaved, what are the chances of another offspring having heterozygous genotype? Support your answer with an explanation.

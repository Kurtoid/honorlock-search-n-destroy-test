Short Answer 4 Nigel is a researcher interested in behavioral enrichment for zoo animals, and wants to investigate the effects of two types of foraging enrichment on chimpanzee behavior.  He plans to compare foraging puzzles, in which the chimps have to extract food out of a central apparatus, to scatter foraging, in which keepers hide and scatter small food bits across the entire enclosure.  Nigel plans to measure the amount of time chimps spend foraging and feeding in each enrichment condition.  One of his lab assistants, Zak, suggests that he run his experiment using an independent-samples design, so that a different set of chimps are used for each enrichment condition.  Nigel's other lab assistant, Bronson, suggests a related-samples design, in which the same set of chimps receives both conditions. a. If all other factors are equal, which design (Zak's or Bronson's) should have greater statistical power? Briefly explain why.  (4 pts.) b. If all other factors are equal, which design should have a greater risk of a Type II error? Briefly explain why.  (3 pts.)

How long should a patient remain on antidepressant medication after having experienced four major depressive episodes in the last 5 years?
A 16-year-old is undergoing fluid replacement after being burned on 20% of their body 12 hours ago. The nursing assessment reveals a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, a pulse rate of 110 beats/minute, and a urine output of 20 mL over the past hour. The nurse reports the findings to the health care provider (HCP) and anticipates which prescription?
The patient is a 19-year-old female college scholar-athlete who is a scholarship basketball player at the state university. She has had repeated injuries to her knees over the past seven years while she has played in competitive sports, including basketball, softball and soccer. Over the past three months she had noted a feeling of instability in the left knee, more than usual and with increasing pain over the medial compartment, as a result of these old injuries. The physicians who had treated her over the past year were fairly confident that she had a torn anterior cruciate ligament and suspected possible tears to the medial meniscus and medial collateral ligament from the past injuries and not a new traumatic problem. She was admitted to the hospital for reconstructive surgery, with a planned transfer to a sports rehabilitation unit at the university hospital. At surgery, the orthopedic surgeon found a grossly positive Lachman's sign and anterior drawer in neutral, internal and external rotation_ The medial meniscus was torn at the posterior horn in a complex fashion posteriorly. There was no repairable tissue. The medial collateral ligament was torn; that was probably a new injury. The good news was the surfaces of the patellofemoral joint, medial compartment, and lateral compartments were in good condition. The anterior cruciate ligament was completely torn and was most likely a recent injury just discovered during this procedure. The posterior cruciate ligament was intact, and the patellar tendons rode laterally in the notch. At the conclusion of the procedure, the knee was stable to Lachman and drawer testing. The procedures performed on the left knee were an arthroscopic reconstruction/reinforcement of the anterior cruciate ligament using nonautologous patellar tendon graft, repair of the medial meniscus and medial collateral ligament, also known as the triad knee repair or O'Donoghue procedure that includes a medial meniscectomy. After three days of postoperative recovery, the patient was transferred to the sports rehabilitation unit for a complex rehabilitation program.

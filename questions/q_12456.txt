The beam is composed of three planks fastened together with screws as shown.  It is subjected to the symmetric loading  kN.  The widths of the joints at a and b are both  mm.  If each screw can support a maximum of   N in shear, then the required spacing  of the screws, rounded down to the next  mm, is _______ [mm]. Note:  Rounding down to the next 5 mm means, if you calculate s = 34.1 mm, then put 30 mm as your answer.  Note that the spacing has to be the same on top and bottom rows. The centroid and moment of inertia of the cross section have already been calculated for your convenience:

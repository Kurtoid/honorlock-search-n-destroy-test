Being an intellectual means more than doing your homework.  If so few kids come to college understanding this, it is no wonder.  They are products of a system that rarely asked them to think about something bigger than the next assignment.

It forgot that the true purpose of education is to make minds, not careers."   Essay Prompt: Compare, Contrast, Reflect In an essay, discuss the author's assertion about the true purpose of education.

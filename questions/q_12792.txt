. . .  time itself seemed to stand still.    At last Winnie observed: "This isn't a very good horse."    Her eyes gleamed in the shadow of the cab straight ahead, immovable.  On the box, Stevie shut his vacant mouth first, in order to ejaculate earnestly: "Don't."    The driver, holding high the reins twisted around the hook, took no notice.  Perhaps he had not heard.  Stevie's breast heaved.    "Don't whip."    The man turned slowly his bloated and sodden face of many colours bristling with white hairs.  His little red eyes glistened with moisture.  His big lips had a violet tint.  They remained closed.  With the dirty back of his whip-hand he rubbed the stubble sprouting on his enormous chin.    "You mustn't," stammered out Stevie violently.  "It hurts."    "Mustn't whip," queried the other in a thoughtful whisper, and immediately whipped.  He did this, not because his soul was cruel and his heart evil, but because he had to earn his fare.  And for a time the walls of St Stephen's, with its towers and pinnacles, contemplated in immobility and silence a cab that jingled.  It rolled too, however.  But on the bridge there was a commotion.  Stevie suddenly proceeded to get down from the box.  There were shouts on the pavement, people ran forward, the driver pulled up, whispering curses of indignation and astonishment.  Winnie lowered the window, and put her head out, white as a ghost.  In the depths of the cab, her mother was exclaiming, in tones of anguish: "Is that boy hurt?  Is that boy hurt?"    Stevie was not hurt, he had not even fallen, but excitement as usual had robbed him of the power of connected speech.  He could do no more than stammer at the window.  "Too heavy.  Too heavy."  Winnie put out her hand on to his shoulder.    "Stevie!  Get up on the box directly, and don't try to get down again."    "No.  No.  Walk.  Must walk."    In trying to state the nature of that necessity he stammered himself into utter incoherence.  No physical impossibility stood in the way of his whim.  Stevie could have managed easily to keep pace with the infirm, dancing horse without getting out of breath.

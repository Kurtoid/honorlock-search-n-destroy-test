[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).] A 735-N man is standing on a scale in an elevator which is moving downward with an initial speed of 7.0 m/s, and 3.0 seconds later, is moving downward at 15 m/s. a. Draw a clearly labeled free body diagram showing all the forces acting on the man.  b. Draw a clearly labeled dot diagram for the man's motion. c. Calculate the normal force acting on the man during the time described above (what does the scale read, in Newtons).  d. Then the elevator stops accelerating, and starts decelerating (slowing down) at the same rate, and by now slows from 15 m/s to 7 m/s in 3 seconds.  During this time, draw the FBD, and calculate the normal force acting on the man (what does the scale say, in Newtons). Note: Be sure to choose a coordinate system and use it throughout this problem. [Enter the answers for c and d in the box below.  Immediately following the exam, you will upload your work for all four parts, including your FBDs, with your coordinate system clearly labeled]   Your Answer:

Suppose that a local supermarket sells apples and oranges for 50 cents apiece, and at these prices is able to sell 100 apples and 200 oranges per week. One week, the supermarket lowered the price per apple to 40 cents and sold 120 apples. The next week, they lowered the price per orange to 40 cents (after raising the price per apple back to 50 cents) and sold 240 oranges. These results imply that the

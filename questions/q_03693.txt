Calculating GPA  Create a C function called gradeValue(). This function accepts one input argument with a single character type. The function gradeValue() should be able to determine the value of a letter grade and return a floating point number which represents the value of the input letter grade.    Letter Grade Value   A 4.00   B 3.00   C 2.00   D 1.00   F 0.00   Others -1.00    Use switch-case statement within the function gradeValue(). Assume that the input argument is always a capital letter (no need to create cases for lowercase letters). If the value of the input argument is not one of the valid letter grades as listed above, the function gradeValue() must return -1.00 Complete the given C code below to create a C program that can display a list of 6 courses along with their corresponding credits and letter grades. Then, the program should be able to calculate Grade Point Average (GPA) of those 6 courses. (Hint: Call the function gradeValue() within the repetition statement to convert letter grade to grade value. Declare additional variables if necessary.) #include int main(){    char name[6][30]={"Physics","Physics Lab","Programming","Japanese","Calculus","Chemistry"};    int credit[]={3,1,3,3,4,3}, i;    char letter[]={'B','A','A','C','D','F'};        printf("%-13s %6s %6snn","Course","Credit","Grade");                   return 0;} Formula to calculate GPA: (where n is the total number of courses)

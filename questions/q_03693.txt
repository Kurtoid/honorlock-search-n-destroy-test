Suppose that a dendritic cell has encountered a foreign antigen from a bacterial cell.  This triggers a series of events that eventually leads to agglutination of bacterial cells.  Outline this series of events, starting with a dendritic cell encountering a bacterial antigen, and ending with agglutination of bacteria. Your answer should include all the cells/molecules/receptors that are involved. It's recommended that you first draw your answer on your piece of scratch paper before typing in your answer in the space below. Even though your drawing won't be collected, it can help you organize your typed-out answer.

Virginia springbeauty is a woodland plant with flowers that are either red (AA), pink (Aa), or white (aa).  A conservation biologist studying a population of springbeauty plants observes the following:   Slugs prefer to eat plants with red flowers and plants suffering slug damage are more likely to die. The average number of seeds produced per plant varies with flower color. Red-flowered, pink-flowered and white-flowered plants produce 56, 38 and 24 seeds, respectively. Flower color allele and genotype frequencies have remained relatively stable in the study population for several years.   If the biologist attempts to increase the size of the springbeauty population by removing as many slugs as possible from the area inhabited by the study population, what would you expect to happen in the population over time?

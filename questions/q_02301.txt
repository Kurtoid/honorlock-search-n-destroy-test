This question follows the inheritance of an autosomal recessive lethal disease in which neurological deterioration occurs early in life and people affected with the disorder die at a very young age. The mutation responsible for the disease occurs in the gene N which has two alleles N and n. The disease is considered rare in the population but it occurs at a relatively high frequency in the descendants of the Wari civilization that inhabited the Central Andes of Peru. A woman named Urpi whose maternal uncle had the disease is trying to determine the probability that she and her husband Jose could have an affected child. Her father does not come from a high-risk population. Her husband's sister died of the disease at an early age. Part A. (12 points) Draw the pedigree using the appropriate symbols/notation, including generations (1 point), individuals in the pedigree and the genotypes next to each symbol. ALL Carriers must have half-shaded symbol.  The pedigree should ONLY include the following and in the specified order:  Generation I: Urpi's maternal grandmother and grandfather (2 individuals). (2 points). Generation II: Urpi's uncle, Urpi's parents, and Jose's parents (5 individuals). (5 points). Generation III: Urpi, Jose and Jose's sister (3 individuals). (3 points). Generation IV: Urpi and Jose's future child (1 individual, sex unspecified (use diamond shape), genotype unknown=?). (1 point).  Part B.  (8 points) Determine the probability that the couple's child will be affected (follow the order below). Show your calculations and Punnet squares (if needed) in order to calculate:  Probability that Urpi's mom is a carrier. (2 pts) Probability that Urpi is a carrier (Hint: This can be found by the probability that Urpi's mom passes the recessive allele assuming she is a carrier). (2 pts) Probability that Jose (Urpi's husband) is a carrier. (2 pts) Overall probability that Urpi and Jose's child will be affected (Hint: You will need the probability that Urpi is a carrier, the probability that Jose is a carrier, and the probability of each parent passing the affected allele). (2 pts)    Show both sides of each of your papers to the camera before submitting and exiting the Exam. Do not forget to show your work for your questions on the scratch paper(s).

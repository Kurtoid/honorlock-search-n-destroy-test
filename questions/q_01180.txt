Consider the reaction N2(g) + O2(g)    2NO(g), for which Kc = 0.10 at 2,000oC. Starting with initial concentrations of 0.040 M of N2 and 0.040 M of O2, determine the equilibrium concentration of NO.
4.  Parts arrive to a system consisting of two workstations according to a Poisson process with a mean arrival rate of 120 per day.  The parts are first processed through WS I and then through WS II.  After WS II, 90% of the parts are deemed good and 10% are deemed bad.  The first workstation has one single-server machine that has a processing time described by a triangular distribution with parameters 6, 8, and 13 minutes.  The second workstation has two single-server machines operating in parallel with a single queue feeding both machines.  Both machines in WS II have exponential processing times with one machine having an mean processing time of 8 minutes and the other machine with a mean processing time of 24 minutes.  a.  What is the average utilization of WS I? [util1] b.  What is the average utilization of WS II? [util2] c.  What is the average hourly throughput rate of good parts? [th]

A three phase, four pole, 60 Hz, induction motor with a rated stator voltage of 660 V line-line has the following equivalent circuit parameters:          R1 = 0.75            R2 = 0.8                 X1 = X2 = 2.0                       Xm = [?]          Suppose the motor is running at a rotor speed of 1725 rpm, and rated stator voltage.  Find the slip.  Find the power converted from electrical to mechanical. Find the frequency of the current in the rotor. Find the starting torque.

A solution containing CaCl2 is mixed with a solution of Li2C2O4 to form a solution that is 2.5 x 10-5 M in calcium ion and 3.5x10-6 M in oxalate ion (C2O42-). What will happen once these solutions are mixed? Ksp (CaC2O4)=2.9x10-9 A precipitate [blank1] since [blank2]
A Broadway investor is interested in predicting the gross sales in millions. He has data from 2001 to 2010.  He was considering variables attendance, mean ticket and new productions.  Run the Forward Selection method using the p-value threshold (at default settings) and determine what variable should be added first.        Season Gross($M) Attendance New Productions Mean ticket   2001 643 10.95 36 58.72   2002 721 11.42 36 63.13   2003 771 11.61 38 66.41   2004 769 11.53 39 66.69   2005 862 12 39 71.83   2006 939 12.31 35 76.27   2007 938 12.27 36 76.45   2008 943 12.15 43 77.61   2009 1020 11.89 39 85.78   2010 1081 12.53 42 86.27

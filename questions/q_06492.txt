Governor Richard Coke's explanation for "driving Indians from the Texas Plains," Edward S. Curtis' photographs of Native American life and the book, "Empire of the Summer Moon," offer very different perspectives about the life and culture of Plains Indians.  Why is it important to consider multiple primary and secondary sources when studying history?

Use the answer bank below to answer the questions unless its a number then just type that in (make sure its a whole number, no decimals.)   Cardiac output is calculated by [37] (37) x[38](38). So if EDV = 100 ml and ESV = 50 ml and the heart is beating 100 times per minute what is cardiac output:[39] (39: put in the number in L/min). Stroke volume is determined by 3 things: the amount of blood in the heart before contraction called: [40] (40) and measured by: [41] (41), the pressure the left ventricle has to overcome to get blood out called:[42](42) and measured by [43](43), and the force of contraction called:[44](44) and measured by [45](45). During exercise venous return increases drastically due to increased muscle pump this would lead to an increase in which volume: [46](46). The strength of heart contraction is controlled by [47](47) which causes more [48](48) to flow into cardiac myocytes leading to [49] (49) which leads to a stronger contraction. This increase in contraction strength increases stroke volume by decreasing [50](50: cardiac measurement).       A. End diastolic volume   E. Systolic blood pressure   I. Afterload   M. Parasympathetic nervous system   Q. Ca++     B. End systolic volume   F. Contractility   J. Heart rate   N. Somatic nervous system   R. Stronger action potential     C. Ejection fraction   G. Stroke volume   K. Aortic stenosis   O. Na+   S. More actin/myosin interaction     D. Mean arterial pressure   H. Preload   L. Sympathetic nervous system   P. K+   T. More filling time

10. Tay-Sachs disease is a human genetic disease that results in nerve cells in the brain accumulating and becoming clogged with very large and complex lipids. This is due to a lack of lipase enzyme that breaks down lipids. Which organelle must be involved in causing this disease and not functioning correctly?

When a toll like receptor (TLR) gene was first discovered in fruit fly (Drosophilamelanogaster) in 1996, it was unclear whether its homologues exist in mammals. Please design experiments (in other words, write the techniques you would use) to answer the following questions (4 points for undergrads, 2 points for graduate students): A) Do mice have the TLR genes?B) Are the TLR homologue genes transcribed at different levels in different tissues? (graduate students describe at least two different approaches in detail)C) Are TLR proteins expressed at different levels after viral infection?D) Are the TLR proteins expressed on the plasma membranes? (graduate studentsdescribe two different approaches in detail)

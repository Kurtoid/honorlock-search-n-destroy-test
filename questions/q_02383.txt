You now drop 200 grams of pasta (at room temperature) in the boiling pot of water.  By how much will the water temperature change? Assume this process is very fast. The specific heat of water is 4.18 J/g@C, and the specific heat of pasta is 1.80 J/g@C. (Remember to write down the energy balance equation.) How much time will it take to bring the water and pasta back to boiling? (Same power of the stove and same efficiency as in #1.) If you are not confident about your answer in 2a you may assume that the final temperature of water after dropping the pasta is 90.0 @C.

Normal z or Student t Distribution? Unoccupied seats on flights cause airlines to lose revenue. Suppose a large airline wants to estimate its mean number of unoccupied seats per flight over the past year. To accomplish this, the records of 225 flights are randomly selected and the number of unoccupied seats is noted for each of the sampled flights. The sample mean is 11.6 seats and the sample standard deviation is 4.1 seats. Construct a 92% confidence interval for the population mean number of unoccupied seats per flight.   We will use the [f] (type z or t) distribution because the population standard deviation, s, is [g] (type KNOWN or UNKNOWN).   Construct the Confidence Interval: ([j], [k]) (Round to 2 decimal places.)   Conclusion: I am [l]% confident that the true population mean number of unoccupied seats per flight is between [m] and [n].

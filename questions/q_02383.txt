An oil company distills two types of crude oil, A and B, to produce regular and premium gasoline and jet fuel. There are limits on the daily availability of crude oil and the minimum demand for the final products. If the production is not sufficient to cover demand, the shortage must be made up from outside sources at a penalty. Surplus production will not be sold immediately and will incur storage cost. the following table provides the data of the situation:    Fraction yield per bbl   Crude Regular Premium Jet Price/bbl ($) bbl/day   Crude A .20 .1 .25 30 2500   Crude B .25 .3 .10 40 3000   Demand (bbl/day) 500 700 400       Revenue ($/bbl) 50 70 120       Storage costs for surplus production ($/bbl) 2 3 4       Penalty for unfilled demand ($/bbl) 10 15 20           Only develop a mathematical model to determine the best product mix for the refinery (do not find the optimal solution).

Order the steps in the direct proof of the statement: if x is an even integer and y is an odd integers, then (x + y)2 is odd. Note that you do not need to use all the steps given.  Assume (x+y)2 is even. Therefore we can write (x+y)2 = (2a+(2b+1))2 = (2a+2b+1)2. Because a and b are integers, 2a2 + 4ab + 2b2 + 2a + 2b is also some integer z. The expression (2a+2b+1)2 expands to 4a2 + 4b2 + 1.    The expression (2a+2b+1)2 expands to 4a2 + 8ab + 4b2 + 4a + 4b + 1 = 2(2a2 + 4ab + 2b2 + 2a + 2b) + 1. Because a and b are integers, 4a2 + 4b2 + 1 is also some integer z. Therefore (x+y)2= 2z+1 for some integer z, so (x+y)2 is odd. Because x is even, there is an integer a where x=2a. Because y is odd, there is an integer b where y=2b+1.

In a diploid species of plant, the loci for plant height and fruit shape are linked and separated by 22 mu.  Allele D produces tall plants and is dominant to d (short plants).  Allele R produces round fruit and is dominant to r (oval fruit). A plant with the genotype DR//dr produces gametes where normal recombination occurs.  What will be the expected frequency (proportion) of the gametes with genotype DR? Your answer should be a whole number (i.e. 8, 57 etc) to represent 8%, 57%.

The length, in inches, of a box is 3 inches less than twice its width, in inches. Which of the following gives the length, l inches, in terms of the width, w inches, of the box?
1. A PhD student was using dCas9 and APOBEC for cytosine base editing in his project to edit rice. He is observing various bystander mutations that he doesn't desire. What is the editing window of these kind of base editors? What is your hypothesis of why he is observing these and any suggestions as to how he can increase the specificity (5 points)   2. You are working with a native Florida species that you want to genetically engineer to modify certain flower traits. But you realized that it is a recalcitrant plant species, not amenable to regular methods of Agrobacterium mediated transformation and regeneration. What ONE alternative method could you try to use to genetically modify this species? Give details of this method (5 points)   3. You have generated Citrus tristeza virus free orange trees by expressing hairpin-RNA transgene. You called your mom to tell her about your success. Your mom is very proud of your work, but she cautioned you that GMO food crops are not well received in Florida and are a hard sell. You thought about it and came up with a new experiment which enabled you to make virus resistant trees with NO foreign DNA in fruits. How? Explain the mechanism (5 points)   4. Experimental evidence indicates that there is a unique enzyme functioning in the trichomes of a Florida native medicinal plant Medicinala floridiana, which produces a secondary metabolite that may be of great importance to the medical field. HPLC/ MS-MS analysis indicated that the final step in the biosynthesis of this compound occurs through the activity of a trichome specific Cytochrome P450 that shares homology with Arabidopsis. This species has no genetic resources available yet. a. What genomic data do you want to generate to study the biosynthetic pathway of the metabolites (2.5 points) b. Describe an experimental approach that would allow you to identify the full-length transcripts from the candidate Cytochrome P450 enzymes. (2.5 points)
Tracking which shows generate the most tweets is a way that media planners can track
Currently, Coach sells 42,600 handbags annually at an average price of $149 each. It is considering adding a lower-priced line of handbags that sell for $79 each. The firm estimates it can sell 21,000 of these lower-priced handbags per year, but expects to sell 7,200 less of the higher-priced handbags if the project is accepted. What is the net dollar amount of annual sales that should be used when evaluating the addition of this new project? You may use the following Excel workbook for your calculations. Any work in Excel or on scrap paper does not have to be submitted. Blank Workbook.xlsx

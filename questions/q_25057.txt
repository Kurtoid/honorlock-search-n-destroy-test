Problem #3 (25 points): For the Quantum Well below: L=60 A, and Ee1=20meV, Ee2=70meV, Eh1=10meV, Eh2=30meV are relative to their respective band edges.  Also Eg=0.8eV, mn = 0.052m0 and mh = 0.46m0.     A) Calculate the Density of States for the conduction band inside the well for the energy 10meV above Ee1. Give your answer in units of (# states)/(eV*cm2). B) Calculate the Density of States for the conduction band inside the well for the energy 80meV above Ee1. Give your answer in units of (# states)/(eV*cm2). C) If the electron fermi energy is 30meV above Ee1, calculate the total electron carrier density. Give your answer in units of # electrons/cm2.

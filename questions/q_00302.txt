During steady flow conditions, you have measured the following properties for flow through a [d] cm diameter straight, horizontal pipe,  Volume of fluid collected = [V] +- [ev] litres Time over which the data was collected = [t] +- [et] s Distance between the pressure ports = [L] m Pressure drop measured = [p] +- [ep] Pa  You are given the following: rwater = 1000 kg/m3, mwater = 0.001 N.s/m2, 1 litre = 0.001 m3.  Determine the average velocity through this pipe and whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. What is the friction factor for this pipe. Use the box below to answer this part.  Show all your work on the work upload (assumptions, schematics, analysis, etc.) document. Write down units in your equations. Solve symbolically and plug in numbers at the end.
A geology student found an irregularly shaped rock, with a mass of 14.12 grams, and placed it into a graduated cylinder containing 31.50 mL of water. If the water level increased to 42.93 mL after the rock was placed in, what is the density of the rock, in g/mL? ** Units are assumed to be g/mL. Type in only a number**

Which of the following assessment findings is an early sign of a patient experiencing hypoxemia?
Mg(OH)2(s)               +            H3PO4(aq)       ---------->           H2O(l)          +             Mg3(PO4)2(aq) magnesium hydroxide         phosphoric acid.                       water                     magnesium phosphate molar mass Mg(OH)2 = 58.20 g/mol           molar mass H3PO4 = 97.99 g/mol molar mass H2O = 18.02  g/mol                  molar mass Mg3(PO4)2 = 262.86 g/mol          Based on the chemical reaction outlined above, if 4.500g of magnesium hydroxide(Mg(OH)2) reacts with 32.00ml of a 2.00M solution of phosphoric acid(H3PO4), calculate the theoretical mass of magnesium phosphate(Mg3(PO4)2). Select the best choice. (*hint: reaction balanced?)

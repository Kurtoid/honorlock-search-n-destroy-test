A crew of mechanics at Sno Plow Incs Garage repair snow plows that break down at an average of l = 4 vehicles per day (approximately Poisson in nature). The mechanic crew can service an average of 5 vehicles per day with a repair time distribution that approximates an exponential distribution. The crew cost is approximately $300 per day. The cost associated with lost productivity from the breakdown is estimated at $750 per vehicle per day (or any fraction thereof). How much cheaper would it be to hire a second crew (CHOOSE THE NEAREST ANSWER)?

Case Study #1--Esther Dugoni Esther Dugoni is a healthy and fit 70 year old woman.  Esther's mother died 10 days ago and she needs to fly across the country to Detroit. Esther states that she hasn't flown in 20 years.  She made a few short flights years ago when her children got married.  On one of those trips, her plane circled the field for nearly an hour, trying to land between thunderstorms.  The ride was horribly bumpy and the plan was full of passengers.  A few passengers were airsick, including the two men on either side of her.  There was no one to help, as the cabin attendants had to remain in their seats.  They finally landed safely, but it was the last time Esther had been up in a plane. Esther reports, "I don't even like to go to the airport to meet someone.  Even that makes me feel short of breath and kind of sick to my stomach. Then I get sort of a dull pain in my chest and I start to shake and feel like I'm going to die or like something awful will happen.  I know it seems silly, but that's what happens."     Which disorder is Esther likely suffering from?

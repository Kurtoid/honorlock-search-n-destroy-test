Questions 16 to 23 refer to the following information In a field study, several instructors share the results of their students on an online exam that uses three different types of proctoring.  In one condition, the instructors remind students of the honor code for taking online exams and they did not proctor students (Unproctored).  In a second condition, the instructors use a standard proctoring service that uses video (Proctored with Video). Because the study was not planned ahead, the three conditions have quite different sample sizes.  Finally, in a third condition the web browser is locked but no video recording is required (Lockdown no Video).  All the exams were equivalent in content and difficulty.  The exam average scores for the three groups are given below:         Unproctored   Proctored with Videos   Lockdown no Video   Grand Mean     M   89.4   74.3   93.2   85.4     SD   12.3   5.9   9.0          N   147   66   20           We want to test if there is any difference in the means for the three different groups.  The researcher computed the Sum of Squares Within (SSW) to be 25,889.99  Use an alpha of .05 to test the null hypothesis of equal means.

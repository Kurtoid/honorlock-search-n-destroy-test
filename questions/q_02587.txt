JUnit: Suppose that you have written a Java class called RationalNumber, with a constructor that takes two arguments of type double; If num and denom are given as arguments, then the rational number num/denom is created, after reducing (i.e., removing the common factors). For example, if we pass 6 and 8 as arguments, we get the rational number, 3/4. That is, new RationalNumber(6, 8) creates the number 3/4. Assume that there is an appropriately defined equals method. We are interested in testing the method for subtraction, which is declared as follows: public RationalNumber subtract(RationalNumber r) This method returns a new rational number that is the result of subtracting r from this. For example, if r1 represents 3/4 and r2 represents 2/3, then r1.subtract(r2) returns 1/12. For the above subtract method, write a single test method in Java/JUnit that uses input values that are not already given in the previous paragraph. Fill in the code below:

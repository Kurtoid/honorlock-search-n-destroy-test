In the following study 1. What is the independent variable? 2. What is the dependent variable? 3. What type of study is this?   Objective: Phantom limb pain (PLP) is prevalent in patients post-amputation and is difficult to treat. We assessed the efficacy of mirror therapy in relieving PLP in unilateral, upper extremity male amputees. Methods: Fifteen participants from Walter Reed and Brooke Army Medical Centers were randomly assigned to one of two groups: mirror therapy (n = 9) or control (n = 6, covered mirror). Participants were asked to perform 15 min of their assigned therapy daily for 5 days/week for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was pain as measured using a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale. Results: Subjects in the mirror therapy group had a significant decrease in pain scores, from a mean of 44.1 (SD = 17.0) to 27.5 (SD = 17.2) mm (p = 0.002). In addition, there was a significant decrease in daily time experiencing pain, from a mean of 1,022 (SD = 673) to 448 (SD = 565) minutes (p = 0.003). By contrast, the control group had neither diminished pain (p = 0.65) nor decreased overall time experiencing pain (p = 0.49). A pain decrement response seen by the 10th treatment session was predictive of final efficacy. Conclusion: These results confirm that mirror therapy is an effective therapy for PLP in unilateral, upper extremity male amputees, reducing both severity and duration of daily episodes.

A thermal power plant uses an ideal Rankine cycle with a steam flow rate of 8899 lbm/hr.  The boiler pressure and exit temperature are 2000.0 psia and 900.0degF, respectively; and the condenser pressure is 3.000 psia.  The plant capacity factor is 72.60%.  Exclusively using English values and units for the thermal analysis, determine: (a) the feedwater pump specific work,(b) the cycle thermodynamic efficiency, and(c) the net power output (in kW or MW) of the cycle.

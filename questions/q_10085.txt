A rigid insulating rod is firmly mounted along the vertical direction. Gravity acts downward (g = 9.81 m/s2). A particle of charge Qa  = +6 mC is fixed to the rod. A plastic bead with a hole drilled through it is slipped over the rod on top of the fixed charge so that it can move up and down along the rod, as shown below. The mass of the bead is 500 g. The net charge of the moveable plastic bead is Qb. The moveable plastic bead reaches an equilibrium, hovering 10 cm over the fixed charge. (Assume any friction can be neglected.)  1. Draw a free body diagram for the moveable plastic bead, showing all the forces acting upon it. 2. What is the charge Qb of the moveable bead? 3. If the mass of the bead were doubled, how far above the fixed charge would it now hover at equilibrium?

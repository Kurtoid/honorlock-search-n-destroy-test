6) Ryan is a psychologist interested in the relationship between sleep and learning.  Ryan randomly recruited 200 participants.  He first asked all the participants to read a 2-page essay on a rare genetic disorder.  He then randomly divided the participants into a "Nap" group and a "No Nap" group.  The "Nap" group was given a drug that caused them to fall asleep. They were allowed to sleep for 2 hours before being woken up.  The "No Nap" group was asked to lie quietly on a bed for two hours, but not to fall asleep. Their brain waves were measured and if they started to fall asleep, they were woken up immediately.  After the two hours were finished (either the Nap or No Nap), Ryan then had all the participants take a 20-question multiple choice test on the genetic disorder they had read about previously.  Ryan found that the "Nap" group outperformed the "No Nap" group by 30%.     What type of methodology did Ryan use in his study?

The 1918 influenza pandemic was responsible for an estimated 50-100 million deaths worldwide and between 500,000-675,000 in the U.S. alone. During the outbreak, U.S. cities differed in how quickly they adopted "nonpharmaceutical interventions" like closing schools, churches, dance halls and theaters, banning large public gatherings, and other social distancing measures. For example, in Philadelphia, officials initially downplayed the seriousness of the disease and held a city-wide parade. Social distancing interventions were not implemented until more than two weeks after the initial report of the disease. In contrast, just two days after the first case of the disease was reported in St. Louis, authorities implemented a variety of social distancing measures.

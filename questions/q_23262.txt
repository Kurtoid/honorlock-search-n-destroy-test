Suppose we want to create a Weather Data Analysis Program. We read in a series of daily temperatures from an input file, reported the average temperature, and listed the days whose daily temperature exceeded this average temperature. Now suppose we wanted to modify our program to accept user input read in directly from the keyboard instead of from an input file.  Complete the program below that correctly implements this modified weather data analysis program with the appropriate line of code. // Reporting temperatures greater than the average#include using namespace std; int main() {    // Read in temperature data, keeping sum    [c1]  //Creates an integer array called temps capable of holding at most 1000             //temperatures entered by the user.    int counttemps = 0;    int currenttemp = 0;    int total = 0;    cout > currenttemp;    [c2] {        [c3] = currenttemp;        total += currenttemp;        counttemps++;        cout > [c4]   }    // Determine and print out average   float average = [c5]   cout

Social Dilemmas Consider a strategic interaction, in which the US and the EU have the choice to Restrict their greenhouse gas emissions or continue with Business-As-Usual (BAU). The players' payoffs (measured in thousands of dollars per capita) for the four possible outcomes are listed in the table below. For each outcome, the US receives the payoff to the left of the comma, and the EU receives the payoff to the right of the comma. Assume this is a one-shot game and that both players are completely self-interested.        EU     Restrict   BAU     US   Restrict   50, 50   10, 70     BAU   70, 10   30, 30        (2.5 pts.) What strategy would you expect each player to choose in a one-shot game? Why? (2.5 pts.) Indicate which cell represents the Nash equilibrium. What makes it an equilibrium? (2.5 pts.) Does this game illustrate a social dilemma? Why or why not? (2.5 pts.) Consider an international treaty that would punish either player if it plays BAU. How large must the punishment be to ensure that both players Restrict emissions? Why? (2.5 pts.)

Peter Parker wants to improve his 5k pace, so for today's workout, he was prescribed to jog at 188 m/min at a 2% grade for 20 minutes. Enter the energy expenditure in terms of VO2 ml/kg/min. Round to the nearest whole number and do not include units in your answer.  Equations:Age predicted maximum heart rate = 220 - age Intensity: Percent of age predicted heart rate maximum = (220 - age) x (% intensity / 100) Heart rate reserve = (HRmax/peak - HRrest) x (% intensity / 100) + HRrest VO2 Reserve = (VO2max/peak - VO2rest) x (% intensity / 100) + VO2rest Metabolic Equations: Walking: VO2 = 3.5 + (0.1 x speed) + (1.8 x speed x grade)  Jogging: VO2 = 3.5 + (0.2 x speed) + (0.9 x speed x grade)

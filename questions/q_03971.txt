Male dung beetles have a wide range of horn sizes and shapes, which are influenced by the amount of dung (feces) they consume during larval stages. Larger males, which consumed loads of dung develop very large horns, while smaller males develop small horns or have no horns at all. The size of the horns has been shown to be mediated in part by the differential expression of the receptor Notch, which binds to a membrane-bound ligand (Delta) in adjacent cells. This is an example of _____.
Suppose a researcher wanted to test three completely different online ads to see which ad will be most effective at generating click-throughs to the company's website. Each ad would have its own headline, images, and body copy, which would not be the same on any other version.   Which type of experiment would the researcher use?

Consider the following C loop and its translation to RISC-V assembly code, where x5 and x6 contain the starting address of the arrays X and Y, respectively.  Assume that the processor has a maximum vector length of 64.  Assume that all the vector RV64V registers and the scalar RISC-V integer registers not referenced are available for use in the loop.  Rewrite the RISC-V code below to vectorize the loop using RV64V assembly instructions.  In the table below is the form of RV64V instructions that you may find useful.  Note you do not have to enable or disable vector registers. /* C code */for (i = 0; i < 200; i++)   Y[i] = X[i]*Y[i] + a;/* RISC-V code */   fld    f2,a   addi   x4,x5,#1600loop:   fld    f1,0(x5)   fld    f3,0(x6)   fmul.d f1,f1,f3   fadd.d f1,f1,f2   fsd    f1,0(x6)   addi   x5,x5,#8   addi   x6,x6,#8   bne    x5,x4,loop    Instruction Operands Function   vadd v1,v2,f0 Add elements of v2 and f0 and put result in v1.   vmul v1,v2,v3 Multiply elements of v2 and v3 and put result in v1.   vld v1,x1 Load vector register v1 from memory starting at address x1.   vst v1,x1 Store vector register v1 into memory starting at address x1.   setvl x1,x2 Move min(MVL,x2) to vector-length register vl and x1.
Snowfall Enterprises produces a single product. During the current year, Snowfall had a beginning inventory of 13,000 units, produced 35,000 units, and sold 42,000 units. Snowfall's current year costs are as follows:   Snowfall's per-unit costs were the same in prior years. What is Snowfall's ending inventory balance using variable costing? Round to the nearest whole dollar and do not enter a dollar sign (e.g., enter 89, not $89.00).

Read the following scenario.  Using your knowledge about homeostasis and the importance of calcium in the human body, answer the 2 questions provided.  When answering your questions, be sure to use complete sentences with proper grammar and correct sentence structure.    Calcium is needed for muscle contraction, nerve conduction, blood clotting and many other physiological activities.  Calcium concentration in blood is regulated by the hormone parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the active form of vitamin D called calcitriol.  When calcium levels drop, PTH is released from the parathyroid glands into the blood.  Parathyroid hormone targets osteoclasts in bone tissue and increases their break-down of the matrix, so they release more calcium into the blood and bring calcium levels back up.  Parathyroid hormone is also needed for converting vitamin D into calcitriol.  Calcitriol is essential for the absorption of calcium from foodstuffs in the small intestine; in other words, without vitamin D, a person has very limited ability to absorb calcium from their diet. Vitamin D deficiencies, if untreated, can lead to excessively high levels of PTH.      What would be the effect of prolonged elevation of PTH?

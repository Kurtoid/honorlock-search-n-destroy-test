[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).] You are investigating a crash scene and there are no human witnesses.  The defendant claims that they were not speeding at all, and that the car just magically started skidding and then crashed into the parked cars on the other side of the road.  The posted speed limit is 35 mph here (which is = 15.6 m/s).  It just stopped raining.  The road curve has a radius of curvature = 40 meters at this location, and you can see skid marks on the road leading to the crash site.  The driver was in a brand new Alpha Romero 4C Spider which has a mass of 1128 Kg.  The Coefficient of Kinetic friction for rubber on dry concrete is 0.5, and for wet concrete it is 0.7.  The Coefficient of Static friction for rubber on dry concrete is 1.0, and for wet concrete it is 0.7.  The acceleration of gravity is -9.8 m/s^2. a. Calculate the maximum safe rated speed for this turn without skidding, in km/h. b. How does this prove that the driver was telling the truth or not?  How fast were they going?

Blinn College BCIS 1305 Practical Exam #1   Name: ___________________________________________ Unit: ______________________    50 points:  Using Microsoft Access on the computer, create the following database, table, and form using the instructions provided. The database must first be saved to the Documents or My Documents folder, not a sub-folder, and named Exam3-Lastname-Firstname, where Lastname is replaced with your Lastname and Firstname is replaced with your Firstname. For example, Joseph Walkowicz would save the database as Exam3-Walkowicz-Joseph (the file extension .accdb will be added automatically).   When finished, get out of Access, (only those working on non-networked laptops, copy your one file to the Instructor's flash drive), and then turn in this Exam.   The instructions are as follows:  Create the Database using the name from above. Create the Table using the name Inventory. Add the 3 records, found below, after creating the Table structure. Add 1 more record (fill in all fields) on your own using your last name in the Item Description.      Item Number   Description   Quantity on Hand   Cost     AB-1450   long handle broom   49.0   4.95     CC-2987   claw hammer   387.0   12.48     DS-7788   toilet seat - cushioned   256.0   11.78     ??-????   your last name with item description   ???.?   ??.??        All Item Numbers consist of 2 uppercase letters, a dash, and then 4 numbers.  The dash should be embedded with the data when saved.   The Item Number is a unique number for the inventory. The Item Number cannot be left blank. The Description can be up to 30 characters long. The Description will always be in lower case. The Description is a mixture of letters, numbers, dashes, and spaces. The Description cannot be left blank. The Quantity on Hand is always entered as a whole number; e.g., 3, 8, 22, 385, etc. The Quantity on Hand is always displayed with one decimal place. The Quantity on Hand is between 0 and 400, inclusive. The Quantity on Hand cannot be left blank. The Cost can be entered with up to 2 decimal digits. The Cost is always displayed with 2 decimal places. The Cost is not displayed with a currency symbol. The Cost is always greater than 0. The Cost cannot be left blank. Create a Form, named Inventory Input, for this Table to be used for inputting records. The form should look like the one from class, vertical alignment of the fields, one record per screen. Enlarge the Form so that the whole screen may be used but not so big that either horizontal or vertical scroll bars appear. Change the Main Title from Inventory Input to the name of the company found in "c" below:  Centered 24 point font Use your last name followed by the word Hardware. For example, Gordon Carruth would use the title Carruth Hardware.   Add a Subtitle:  Centered 14 point font Place under the Main Title and name it: Add Inventory   Center all the fields on the Form. They should all line up on the form like what we did in class. Add a message to the right of the Item Number that explains how to enter the information into that field. Adjust the sizes of the boxes on screen so that they not only will show all information but also so that they do not take up space beyond what is needed. Right align the text in the boxes to the left of the fields:  Make sure a colon is at the end of each of these labels.   Left align the information displayed in all the fields where the data is typed in by the user. Add a button to the bottom-left of the Form:  To ADD a new record (data) to the table. When the user clicks on this button, the user should be taken to a new blank form so that they may start typing a new record without scrolling through any previously entered records.   Add a second button to the bottom-right of the Form:  To Close the Form. When the user clicks on this button, the user should not be prompted to save, saving should happen automatically.

DIRECTIONS: Read the passage. Then complete each note from the passage with the correct word from the box. Two words are extra.The Race to India[A] In the 15th century, there was a race among Europeans to reach India because of the riches it offered. Indian spices1 were like gold. Because of the high demand, European traders could make a fortune2 by selling them. [B] The problem, however, was that these spices were not so easy to obtain. The journey to India was a complicated one. Traveling by horse was very slow, especially in mountainous areas. Furthermore, reaching India by land involved passing through countries that were not always friendly to Europeans. The chances of being attacked were high. [C] When the Ottoman Empire3 took over Constantinople4 in 1453, the journey to India became even more difficult. The Ottomans took control of the trade routes between Europe and Asia for their own financial benefits. This forced the Europeans to try to reach India by sea. It began what is now known as the Age of Discovery.Two Great Explorers [D] Most people know the story of Christopher Columbus. He was hired by the king of Spain to reach India by crossing the Atlantic Ocean. He did not succeed in this mission. The reason for this is because, on his way, he found America instead - a "new world" unknown to Europeans. For this achievement in the year 1492, Columbus is considered the most famous explorer of the Age of Discovery.[E] If Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama were still alive, what might he say about Columbus's fame? He might simply shake his head. After all, Vasco da Gama was the first explorer to reach India by sea. [F] Unlike Columbus, Vasco da Gama attempted to reach India by sailing around the southernmost point of Africa and into the Indian Ocean. His trip was long and full of challenges. Although he and his crew sailed from Portugal in July 1497, they did not reach India until May 1498. Despite this, he reached his objective. Europeans had a new route to India and, more importantly, its spices. For this reason, although less famous than Columbus, Vasco da Gama has also been admired for his discoveries as one of the greatest explorers in world history.  1 Spices are powders or seeds from plants which are used in cooking to give flavor to food (e.g., black pepper or cinnamon) 2 Fortune is a large amount of money or great wealth.3 The Ottoman Empire was a large empire based in Turkey, founded in the 13th century, which included large parts of Eastern Europe, Asia, and North Africa. 4 Constantinople is present-day Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey.   Africa  Discovery 1492 1453 Europeans Spain Portugal             OE took over Constantinople in ________.

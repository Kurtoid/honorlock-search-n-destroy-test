The accountant for VVF, Inc. made a list of the accounts and their balances from the general journal; however, absent-mindedly, he/she did not prepare the information in a Trial Balance format. 1.  For each of the accounts, place the account balance in the correct column, either as a debit balance or a credit balance.  All accounts are "normal".  If there is no balance in a column, place a 0 (for zero). In other words, every blank must be filled with either the account balance OR a zero. Do NOT enter dollar signs or commas.  2.  Enter totals for both the debit balances and for the credit balances.  (Remember that a Trial Balance must have total debit balances equal to to total credit balances.)

Monetta, Inc, has no debt, but is considering borrowing for the first time to finance a three-year project. The company currently has an unlevered cost of capital of 15 percent and a 30 percent tax rate. The project requires an initial investment of $2.4 million, which will be straight-line depreciated over the three-year project life. The project, which is as risky as the firm's current projects, is expected to generate earnings before depreciation of $1,200,000 per year for the three years. The capital for the initial investment will be raised with a loan for the full amount. The loan's interest rate is 11 percent (which is also the current risk-free rate) and the principal will be repaid in one balloon payment at the end of the third year. What is the APV of the project?

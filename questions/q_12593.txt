Sally approached Owen, the owner of 40 acres of land in the town about purchasing Owen's land to develop a shopping mall.   Owen and Sally agreed on a purchase price for the sale contract of $220,000 and entered into a sale contract for the land.  Benny owned land near the land purchased by Sally.  Benny heard about Sally's plans to develop a shopping mall and believed that his land would be an excellent location for a hotel and water park.  Benny contracted with a developer to build the hotel and water park and has spent $50,000 of his own money to develop the project.   After entering into the contract with Owen, Sally learned that Owen had lied to her about the land, and that it would be impossible for her to build a mall on the property no highway or road could actually be constructed that would access the property.

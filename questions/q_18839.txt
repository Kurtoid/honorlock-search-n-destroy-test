The MOH amount of $2 includes a provision for normal spoilage and rework. 'Top of the Muffin' quality control specialists reject 400 boxes, a normal rejection rate, because the boxes don't meet the particular specifications of UW-Madison (thus the spoilage is attributable to a specific job).   These normally spoiled boxes can not be sold to UW-Madison and instead are sold immediately to other customers for $2 per box.    In addition, an employee at 'Top of the Muffin' dropped 100 boxes (an abnormal event), spoiling them.

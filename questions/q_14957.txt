The protein encoded by the Lactate dehydrogenase A gene catalyzes the conversion of L-lactate and NAD to pyruvate and NADH in the final step of anaerobic glycolysis. A team of researchers found several variants when sequencing the genomes of 1000 individuals that  participated in their study. The first 20 codons for each variant is shown below: Codon # 1       2         3       4        5        6       7       8      9       10      11     12    13     14     15       16     17    18      19      20  Var1: gtg ctg cag ccg ctg ccg ccg att ccg gat ctc att gcc acg cgc ccc cga cga ccg ccc... ...

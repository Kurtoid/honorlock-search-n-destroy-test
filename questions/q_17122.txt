These exam questions were randomized, and individual students were asked questions about different topics. If there was something you studied but didn't get asked about here, please (a) describe/define that topic, (b) give an example of this topic in the real world, and (c) describe a research study relating to this topic (max of 5 extra credit points for all 3 parts).  In addition, for anyone who needs to describe any problems that happened during the exam or a problem with a particular question, please do so here as well.

A project requires the completion of eight activities. The normal time (weeks), maximum crash time (weeks), and per week crash cost ($) for each activity are shown in the table below.    Activity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   normal time 8 6 7 9 4 5 5 8   max crash time 3 2 4 4 2 2 2 4   per week cost 550 675 475 500 725 450 625 775    The project must be completed within 20 weeks. Using the above information and the project network shown below, develop a linear programming formulation that can be used to determine which activities should be crashed (and by how many weeks) so that the project can be completed on time at minimum cost. Again, do not attempt to solve the problem in any way - just provide the formulation.

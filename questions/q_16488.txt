OEDIPUSMy children, latest born to Cadmus old, Why sit ye here as suppliants, in your hands Branches of olive filleted with wool? What means this reek of incense everywhere, And everywhere laments and litanies?Children, it were not meet that I should learn From others, and am hither come, myself, I Oedipus, your world-renowned king. Ho! aged sire, whose venerable locks Proclaim thee spokesman of this company, Explain your mood and purport. Is it dread Of ill that moves you or a boon ye crave? My zeal in your behalf ye cannot doubt; Ruthless indeed were I and obdurate If such petitioners as you I spurned. PRIEST Great Oedipus. O powerful King of Thebes!You see how all the ages of our peopleCling to your altar steps: here are boysWho can barely stand alone, and here are priestsBy weight of age, as I am a priest of God,And young men chosen from those vet unmarried;As for the others. all that multitude,They wait with olive chaplets in the squares,At the two shrines of Pallas, and where ApolloSpeaks in the glowing embers.Your own eyesMust tell you, Thebes is tossed on a murdering seaAnd can not lift her head from the death surge.A rust consumes the buds and fruits of the earth;The herds are sick: children die unborn,And labor is vain. The god of plague and pyreRaids like detestable lightning through the city,And all the house of Kadmos is laid waste,All emptied, and all darkened: Death aloneBattens upon the misery of Thebes. You are not one of the immortal gods, we know;Yet we have come to you to make our prayerAs to the man surest in mortal waysAnd wisest in the ways of God. You saved usFrom the Sphinx, that flinty singer, and the tributeWe paid to her so long; vet you were neverBetter informed than we, nor could we teach you:It was some god breathed in you to set us free.Therefore, O mighty King, we turn to you:Find us our safety, find us a remedy,Whether by counsel of the gods or men.A king of wisdom tested in the pastCan act in a time of troubles, and act well.Noblest of men, restoreLife to your city! Think how all men call youLiberator for your triumph long ago;Ah, when your years of kingship are remembered,Let them not say We rose. but later fellKeep the State from going down in the storm!Once, years ago, with happy augury,You brought us fortune; be the same again!No man questions your power to rule the land:But rule over men, not over a dead city!Ships are only hulls, citadels are nothing,When no life moves in the empty passageways. OedipusAh! my poor children, known, ah, known too well,The quest that brings you hither and your need.Ye sicken all, well wot I, yet my pain,How great soever yours, outtops it all.Your sorrow touches each man severally,Him and none other, but I grieve at onceBoth for the general and myself and you.Therefore ye rouse no sluggard from day-dreams.Many, my children, are the tears I've wept,And threaded many a maze of weary thought.Thus pondering one clue of hope I caught,And tracked it up; I have sent Menoeceus' son,Creon, my consort's brother, to inquireOf Pythian Phoebus at his Delphic shrine,How I might save the State by act or word.And now I reckon up the tale of daysSince he set forth, and marvel how he fares.'Tis strange, this endless tarrying, passing strange.But when he comes, then I were base indeed,If I perform not all the god declares. PRIESTThy words are well timed; even as thou speakestThat shouting tells me Creon is at hand.

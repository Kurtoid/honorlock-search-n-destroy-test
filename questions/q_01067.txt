First, choose one of the following "Capacities of Heart" to discuss: Self-Compassion or Compassion.    Then, using your understanding of Mindfulness (Capacity of Mind), explain how Mindfulness serves to enable the Capacity of Heart that you have chosen (Self-Compassion or Compassion), and how both of these (Capacity of Mind and Heart) function together to enable Generative Caring behaviors. Ideal essays will do two things:  Draw upon specific research findings and/or concepts discussed in class that link one virtue to another, and that link both to Generative outcomes.  Illustrate this through a specific example or "case study." Talk us through how a person who lacks one or both of these virtues could become inhibited from demonstrating Generative Care, and how the presence of one or both of these virtues would enable them to exhibit Generative Care in specific situations.  In the best-case (most growth-inducing) scenario, you should try to use your own life as an example. But if this feels too vulnerable, you are welcome to "fictionalize" the case study.

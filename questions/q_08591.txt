Assume that VS = 9V and the forward voltage of both diodes at 1mA of current  is 0.7 volts    Assume that Rb is chosen so that the current through the diodes is 1mA.  What is the average DC value for Vout in volts? Vout=[VoutDC]   What value of Rb makes the current through the diodes equal to 1mA. Rb= [Rb] Give your answer in K ohms.    Using the DC operating point calculate the diode small signal resistance. rd1 = rd2 = [rd] Give your answer in ohms   After measuring VS you realize that VS=9V + 0.1 sin(120

In the space below, list your answer to each question, labeling the questions as a, b, c, d, and e, and putting the answer(s) beside them. Questions a through d will each have one answer. Question e can have more than one answer (list all that apply). a. A fan cart, with frictionless wheels and negligible air resistance is placed on a level surface with the fan applying a constant force to the cart. The fan propels the cart at: (pick the best answer)       i. constant velocity       ii. increasing velocity       iii. decreasing velocity       iv. increasing, then constant velocity b. A rock is thrown straight upward. At the peak, the acceleration is: (pick the best answer)       i. zero because the only force acting on the rock at that time is the force of gravity       ii. zero because the force of gravity and the air resistance force are equal in size       iii. downward because air resistance is acting on it       iv. downward because the force of gravity is only force acting on it c. The normal force acting on an object is equal to the force of gravity on that object: (pick the best answer)       i. anytime the object is on a horizontal surface       ii. whenever the object is on an incline       iii. whenever the object is stationary       iv. all of the above       v. none of the above d. A 2.04-kg box is pushed across a level floor with a horizontal force of 10.0 N. Considering friction, the box is speeding up at a rate of 3.92 m/s2. If the horizontal force acting on the box is doubled, to 20.0 N, the acceleration of the box will: (pick the best answer)       i. decrease       ii. remain at 3.92 m/s2.        iii. increase, but be less than doubled       iv. double to 7.84 m/s2       v. more than double e. Two frictionless carts collide with each other on a level surface. Cart A has a mass that is several times larger than the mass of Cart B. Read the following statements about the time during the collision of the carts and SELECT ALL ANSWERS THAT APPLY.        i. Cart A exerts more force on Cart B than Cart B exerts on Cart A       ii. Cart A exerts the same amount of force on Cart B that Cart B exerts on Cart A       iii. Cart A exerts less force on Cart B than Cart B exerts on Cart A       iv. Cart A has a larger magnitude acceleration than Cart B during the collision       v. Cart A has the same magnitude acceleration as cart B during the collision       vi. Cart A has a smaller magnitude acceleration than Cart B during the collision

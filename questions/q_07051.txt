A block of mass m = 2.00 kg is attached to the end of an ideal spring. Due to the weight of the block, the block remains at rest when the spring is stretched a distance h = 7.00 cm from its equilibrium length. The block gets bumped and undergoes a small vertical displacement. Find the resulting linear frequency f of the block's oscillations in Hz about its equilibrium position. (Hint: what is the spring constant k of the spring in N/m?)

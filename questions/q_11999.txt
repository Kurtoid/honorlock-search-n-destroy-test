Figure 5 shows the designs for dual-threshold CMOS method (Fig. 5(a)) and dynamic Vth method (Fig. 5(b)) for low leakage design. Answer the following questions: (a) Which design requires switching (between sleep and normal modes) power overhead? (b) Which design uses the idea of stacking effect? (c) In low work-load (e.g., 5% of the time, the circuit is busy), which design will save more power? Why? (d) In high work-load (e.g., 95% of the time, the circuit is busy), which design will save more power? Why?

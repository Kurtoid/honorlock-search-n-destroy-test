QUESTION 1             Read the questions carefully and select the right option (A, B, C or D).                           Questions 1.1 and 1.2 refer to the experiment described below. In an experiment to determine the viscosity of a liquid, a student releases a sphere from rest into the liquid in a tall measuring cylinder. The sphere reaches terminal velocity. She records the distance through which the sphere falls at terminal velocity and the time taken.                       1.1   Which of the following would be most suitable for measuring the distance, in millimetres, through which the sphere travelled?    A.  metre rule B.  micrometer screw gauge C.  scale on the measuring cylinder D.  vernier calipers   (1)                   1.2   Which of the following should she use to measure the diameter of the sphere?   A.  metre rule B.  micrometer screw gauge C.  scale on the measuring cylinder D.  vernier calipers   (1)                       Questions 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 refer to the experiment described below. In an experiment to determine the acceleration of free fall g, a student drops a golf ball from rest.                       1.3   Which of the following equations, by itself, should she use?   A. s =  1/2 (u + v)t B. s = ut +  1/2  at2 C. v = u + at D. v2 = u2 + 2as   (1)                    1.4   The times she records are:   0.61 s  0.63 s  0.49 s  0.58 s   Which of the following should she state as the average time?   A. 0.578 s B. 0.58 s C. 0.607 s D. 0.61 s   (1)                    1.5   Which of the following pieces of apparatus would she not need to use in this experiment?   A. balance B. metre rule C. set square D. stopwatch   (1)

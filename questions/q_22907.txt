Greitemeyer's study (discussed with Ch.2) tested the effects of song lyrics on altruism with the hypothesis that subjects exposed to prosocial song lyrics would be primed to act in a more altruistic (helpful) manner. Some subjects listened to music with prosocial song lyrics; others heard music with neutral song lyrics. All subjects were paid a small amount for their participation then dismissed. But upon leaving, subjects were asked if they would like to donate the money they were just paid to a charity. In this study, altruism is the ___________________ variable, and whether or not participants donated money to a charity is the ___________________ variable.

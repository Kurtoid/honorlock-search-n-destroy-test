Please read the following scenario to answer the following questions.CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas (GHG) that impacts global climate change. Other GHGs may be equally or more effective than CO2 at trapping heat on Earth. Climate scientists determine how much a GHG may impact global warming based on two factors: the efficiency with which a GHG absorbs energy (i.e., traps heat on Earth) and the length of time (in years) that the gas remains in the atmosphere. A unit of measurement called the Global Warming Potential (GWP) is used to describe how much energy a GHG absorbs over a specific period of time (100 years is a standard time frame). All GWP values of GHGs are compared to the GWP of CO2, which is given a value of 1.In this scenario, how would you best describe CO2?

Suppose the true mean weight for 6-month old children is unknown, but a popular medical website claims that the average weight for 6-month old children is 19.5 lbs..  In a survey of 100 pediatricians, the average weight of 35 randomly selected 6-month old children was collected from each pediatrician.  The mean of the average weights reported by all 100 pediatricians was 17.7 lbs, with a standard deviation of 1.2.  Construct a 99% confidence interval for the true mean weight for 6 month old children.  Is it reasonable to believe that the websites claim that the true mean is 19.5 lbs. may be correct?

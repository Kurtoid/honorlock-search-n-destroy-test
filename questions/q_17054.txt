Ellen hears from Suzie that Ophelia's husband, a plastic surgeon, has botched a number of procedures recently and that he is getting sued by at least ten patients. Suzie is a VERY reliable source; she makes it her business to know everything about everyone. Ellen can't get over this news and calls her friend Danielle to tell her about it. Unbeknownst to Ellen, Danielle has scheduled liposuction with Ophelia's husband to take place in two weeks. Danielle gets nervous and cancels the procedure. As it turns out, nothing Suzie said is true. Ophelia's husband has not botched any procedures and is not being sued by any patients. Ellen argues that Suzie is a reliable source and that she (Ellen) truly believed, with good reason, that what she had heard was true. This will be an effective defense if Ophelia's husband sues Ellen for defamation.

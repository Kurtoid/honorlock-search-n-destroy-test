You have two ewes which you use to generate lambs to sell to local kids that they raise and show at the fair. Sally is a ewe with white wool, while Marla has black wool. You purchase semen from a ram named Chuck (who has white wool) to breed both ewes. When the lambs are born, half of Marla's lambs have white wool, the other half have black wool. Sally has two lambs with white wool and one with black wool.  Knowing that white wool is a dominant trait and black wool is recessive, what are the genotypes of Sally, Marla, and Chuck? (Partial credit can be given if work or justification is given.) (3 points) Is it possible for both ewes to have litters with 100% white wool with a different mating? (1 point) Explain your answer to number 2 above: (2 points)

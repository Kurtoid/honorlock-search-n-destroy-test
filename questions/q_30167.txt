The reaction between sucrose and water to produce fructose and glucose is second order overall. The data below shows the change in concentration of sucrose over time at 298K.    A) Using the data above, calculate the rate constant, k, (including appropriate units) for the decomposition of sucrose at 298K. The initial concentration (when t = 0 seconds) is 1.002M. B) Using the rate constant that you determined in Part A, how long will it take for the concentration of sucrose to decrease from 1.002M to 0.212M?

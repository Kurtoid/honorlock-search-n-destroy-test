You examine dishes of tobacco seedlings, noting seedling color.   Each dish represents offspring from a single genetic cross.  You know that there is a single genetic trait involved in chlorophyll production that creates the color difference that you are observe.  Use the following designations for the alleles:G = chlorophyll production; green seedling (dominant)g = no chlorophyll production; white seedling (recessive) In one dish you count 78 green seedlings and 22 white seedlings.  What are the most probable genotypes of the parents?

The following are the main steps in the generation of an action potential.1. Sodium channels are inactivated.2. Voltage-gated potassium channels open and potassium moves out of the cell, initiating repolarization.3. Sodium channels regain their normal properties.4. A graded depolarization brings an area of an excitable membrane to threshold.5. A temporary hyperpolarization occurs.6. Sodium channel activation occurs.7. Sodium ions enter the cell and depolarization occurs.The proper sequence of these events is

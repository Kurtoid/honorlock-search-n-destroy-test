Glycolysis is not the only metabolic pathway for glucose utilization.  This problem explores the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (shown below), named for its discoverers.  The net result of the pathway is that a molecule of glucose is converted to two molecules of CO2 plus two molecules of ethanol.  2-Keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate is split into two molecules (pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) and each continues separately to yield the same final product (ethanol).  Note that the reactions from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to pyruvate are identical to those used in glycolysis.  Can glucose metabolism by the Entner-Doudoroff pathway proceed indefinitely in the absence of a functioning citric acid cycle (in other words, in the absence of oxygen)?  More than one answer may be correct.

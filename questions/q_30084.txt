In this passage, comedian and television host Conan O'Brien speaks at a high school graduation. Commencement Believe it or not, I actually do have some real advice for you. I don't want to freak you out, but twenty-five years ago I could have been any one of you. I was a bright, 5 ambitious, hard-working kid who wanted more than anything to go to a good college. The only problem is that I was much more interested in succeeding than in really learning. So I did a lot of things 10 in high school not because I enjoyed them but because I thought they'd look good on an application. I was going to turn college into just another step on the road to being successful, whatever that 15 meant. And then something weird happened. My roommate was going to an orientation meeting at the school humor magazine, and I decided, for some reason, to tag 20 along. I wrote one piece, then another, then another, and before long I was running the place. The only difference was, I was joyously happy. I was succeeding at something because I loved 25 the process, not because I was trying to get anywhere. I had found the thing I wanted to do for the rest of my life, and I honestly didn't care where it took me or what it paid. 30 So when I graduated from college in 1985, I told my parents, "Thanks for the amazing Ivy League education. Now I want to be a comedian." Later, in the emergency room, after they woke up, 35 they said they were fine with my decision, and I was on my way. If I hadn't allowed myself to experiment and risk doing something without a clear career payoff, I would have missed out on so 40 much. I never would have written for Saturday Night Live. I wouldn't have performed onstage in Chicago in a diaper in 1988. I never would have spent hours crafting the Homer Simpson line "The 45 bee bit my bottom and now my bottom is big." The point is, at this moment many of you have ideas of what you want to do with your lives, but for many of you those 50 ideas will change. And that's because you think you know who you are right now, but you don't. Trust me. When I look back at eighteen-year-old Conan, it's a ridiculous sight. Six feet four, of 55 pale skin and bone. Scared of girls. Squeaky voice. Wait, I'm sorry, that's forty-three-year-old Conan. But life and the choices I've made have changed me in a thousand ways. And none of it would 60 have happened if I had rigidly "kept my eye on the prize" or decided, with great determination, to "follow my dream." I didn't have the slightest idea what my dream was when I was eighteen. It had 65 to find me.     Adapted from Conan O'Brien, "Stuyvesant High School Commencement Speech."

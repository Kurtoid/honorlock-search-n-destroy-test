Long pipes in industrial facilities can undergo significant thermal expansion, especially when they carry hot fluids/gases. Valves and gauges placed at the end of a pipe should have enough clearance from any nearby objects (e.g., the wall of the building) to ensure no collisions occur.  Typical steels used for these pipes have a thermal expansion coefficient of about 10 ppm/degC.  Assuming at an installed temperature of 25 degC a pipe is 100 m long, how much could the pipe expand in total if it operates up to a temperature of 125 degC?

Second - Please write out the correct polypeptide sequence encoded by this protein-coding gene (6.5 points).       NOTE - For these problems, you can assume that the protein-coding gene contains no introns.  However, for full credit, you must specify the polarities of your coding DNA sequence and polypeptide sequence.

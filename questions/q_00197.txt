A 65-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath, productive cough, and hemoptysis. She has a 40-pack-year history of cigarette smoking and continues to smoke. Her only active medical problem is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with a daily anticholinergic agent inhaler (e.g. Spiriva) and an albuterol inhaler as needed. On physical examination, her vital signs are normal. Breath sounds are distant with occasional wheezing. The remainder of the physical examination is normal. 6. Which of the following is the best first step in diagnosing this patient?

A ___ radiator is considered to be an almost perfect emitter.           3. Explain the principle of operation and how a hologram is created.           4. Determine the location/orientation of the image (using ray tracing method) of an inverted object located to the left and outside the focal length of a DCV.           5. A 3.2 mW HeNe laser beam is focused using a positive lens (focal length 180 mm). The spot size area is 3.7 x 10-7 cm2. Determine: a. The spot radius, b. The divergence of the laser beam.           6. A PCV has a focal length of 520 mm and an index of 1.55. The PCV is submerged in water (1.33). Determine the values for R1 and R2.           7. A laser beam is sent through an equilateral prism and the minimum deviation angle measured in air is 34.800. a. Determine the index of refraction of the prism? b. Use the index calculated in step a. to determine the angle of minimum deviation if the prism is submerged in oil (1.29).           8. A two-lens system is made up of a converging lens followed by a diverging lens, each of focal length 160 mm. The system is used to form an image of an object 1.6 cm high, standing erect, 260 mm from the first lens. The two lenses are separated by a distance of 80 cm. Find and describe the image formed by this system using the lens formula.           9. You are handed a CX with a radius of curvature of 650 mm and an object is placed 56 cm in front of the CX. a. What is the focal length? b. Where is the image located at and how far is it? c. Is the image found in part b. real or virtual? Explain. Draw a diagram. d. Is the image larger or smaller than the object?  By what magnification?           10. An oil spill on an ocean coastline near you produces an oil slick on the water for miles around. After a few days, you take a helicopter ride out over the water and notice--with the help of a handheld spectrometer--that the oil slick has a thickness of 0.588 um and its reflecting light of wavelength 420 nm. a. What is the order of the reflected light? (Assume the oil has n = 1.25 and saltwater has n = 1.34) b. Is there an automatic phase shift of l/2 for the light reflected at the bottom of the oil film? c. Is there an automatic phase shift of l/2 for the light reflected at the top face of the oil film?           11. A laser (450 nm) is diffracted from a reflection diffraction grating. The grating has 8.9x103 lines/cm. Determine: a. The angles for the observed diffraction orders; b. What is the total number of orders observed? c. In order to decrease the number of orders observed does the source wavelength needs to be increased or decreased?

You practice in Lexington, Kentucky and you examine a young dog with exercise intolerance and a cough. You are suspicious that the dog has heartworm disease. You set the pretest probability of heartworm disease at 25% based on clinical signs and history. You run a rapid heartworm test. While the test is running you quickly refer to your Likelihood Ratio Method calculator and you determine that the post- test probability (given a positive test) is 84% and the post- test probability (given a negative test) is 0.5%. Select the best response.

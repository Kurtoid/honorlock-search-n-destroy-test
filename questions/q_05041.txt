Federal Jobs Overseas United States citizens are employed by the federal government in Alaska, Hawaii, United States territories, and in foreign countries. They are found in almost every occupational field. They are construction and maintenance workers, doctors, nurses, teachers, technical experts, mining engineers, meteorologists, clerks, stenographers, typists, geologists, skilled tradesmen, social workers, agricultural marketing specialists, and agricultural and other economists. Current needs of agencies with jobs to fill are generally limited to highly qualified and hard-to-find professional personnel, skilled technicians, and, in some cases, stenographers and clerical and administrative personnel. A few agencies are seeking experienced teachers, librarians, nurses, and medical personnel. However, a few vacancies occur in most fields because of normal turnover in personnel. Most vacancies are filled by the appointment of local eligibles who qualify in competitive civil-service examinations which are announced and held in the local area. Normally, there is a sufficient local labor market to fill the needs and examinations are not publicized outside the local areas. Some positions, however, may be filled by transferring career government employees from the United States mainland. When a vacancy is to be filled in a foreign country, a decision is made whether to recruit from among persons in the area where the job is located or to seek qualified applicants residing in the United States. If the position is to be filled locally, the appointee may be a United States citizen residing or traveling in the area, the wife or dependent of a citizen employed or stationed in the area, or a foreign national. In most instances where United States installations are established in foreign countries, either formal or informal agreements have been drawn up assuring the host government that local nations will be employed wherever possible in order to be of maximum assistance to the economy of that country. Furthermore, it is almost always to the economic advantage of the United States to employ foreign nationals at local pay rates without responsibility for travel costs and overseas cost-of-living allowances. Positions held by foreign nationals are in the excepted service and are not subject to the competitive requirements of the Civil Service Act and rules. However, there are many thousands of technical, administrative, and supervisory 30 positions in which United States citizens are employed in foreign countries. These positions are usually in the competitive service, and, as vacancies occur, they are filled in most cases by transferring career government employees from the United States. 26.

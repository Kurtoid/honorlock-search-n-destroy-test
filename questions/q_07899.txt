An 80-year-old male returned to his physician's office to review the findings of the tests that were performed in the past week. The patient had been in his physician's office a week ago complaining of severe unrelenting ear pain, a temporal headache, purulent discharge from his ears, dysphagia, and hoarseness. These conditions were still present. The physical exam again demonstrated marked tenderness in the soft tissue between the mandible ramus and the mastoid tip. The tympanic membrane was intact in both ears. The physician reviewed the results of the chemistry tests, cultures, and bone scan that showed possible osteomyelitis of the mandible. The patient had type 2 diabetes, and it was always poorly controlled. The patient was informed that he had malignant externa otitis of the right ear and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes with hyperglycemia. The management of his condition was proposed to be meticulous glucose control and aural toilet with systemic and ototopic antimicrobial medications. The patient was given a follow-up appointment in three weeks with a repeat bone scan to be performed prior to that visit. Principal diagnosis: [dx1]Secondary diagnoses: [dx2]Assign MS-DRG: [msdrg1]

Questions 1 to 10 refer to the following case: Mrs. A. is a 48 y. old paramedic. She has recently noticed a decrease in her exercise tolerance including being 'short of breath' even on what is described as normal exertion - for instance, climbing several flights of stairs. This has become progressively noticeable over the last 3 months. There is no pain associated with the breathlessness, although there is a cough, especially at night when lying down. She also has a feeling of lethargy, and has noticed that she feels cold most of the time. On examination she is found to be overweight (BMI = 29). Her skin is dry to the touch.   On auscultation of the chest, breath sounds are mostly vesicular with bilateral crepitations at the lung bases.   Question: Mrs A.'s GP is concerned that there is some underlying respiratory pathology and arranges for spirometry. The summary of the results suggest an FEV1:FVC of 0.83, which one of the following is most consistent with this ratio?
Which is more effective according to current research findings?

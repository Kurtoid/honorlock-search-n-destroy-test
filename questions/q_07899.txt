Monetta, Inc, has no debt, but is considering borrowing for the first time to finance a three-year project. The company currently has an unlevered cost of capital of 19 percent and  a 30 percent tax rate. The project requires an initial investment of $1.2 million, which will be straight-line depreciated over the three-year project life. The project, which is as risky as the firm's current projects, is expected to generate earnings before depreciation of $600,000 per year for the three years. The capital for the initial investment will be raised with a loan for the full amount. The loan's interest rate is 7 percent (which is also the current risk-free rate) and the principal will be repaid in one balloon payment at the end of the third year. What is the APV of the project?

(THEN PICK ONE OF THESE TO ANSWER) - 10 points    Do not exceed more than 300 words for the question you select to answer from this box. 3.  Describe the motor unit.  How does it act to develop muscle tension?  In your response delineate between different stages of muscle mechanics (starting with the twitch....).  As you age, some of your muscle fibers are filled with adipose tissue and the synthesis of ACh decreases.  How would this affect muscle tension? 4.  Structurally and functionally compare the vessels of circulation.  What are the cellular mechanisms of how cardiovascular disease may develop in one of the vessels?  How might the ensuing hypertension be detected and how would this affect laminar blood flow?    Name three potential treatments for this degenerative disease in the vessels. 5.  From your text book reading, discuss Muscular Dystrophy.  Using the physiological terminology that you acquired from the last few weeks, explain in cellular terms the ramification of excitation contraction coupling and tension development in such a patient.

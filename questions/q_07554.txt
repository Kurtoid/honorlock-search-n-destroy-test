Question 5: Immunotherapy (Dr. O. Guryanova)    Describe the mechanism of action of bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) such as Blinatumomab. What are the possible limitations of this therapeutic agent? Side effects? How are they related to the mechanism of action? (4 pts)      2. You are collaborating with an oncologist on a clinical trial evaluating a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer. Among other things, the trial collects data on the lifestyle choices and environmental exposures for each enrolled subject. The physician has noticed that a subset of patients had good response to this therapy with noticeable regression of tumors, while in other patients the drug had little effect. What are the factors that may predict favorable response to ICIs? What would you look for in each patient's medical history? Please describe possible mechanism(s) necessary for ICI efficacy, and propose an approach to test them experimentally. (6 pts)

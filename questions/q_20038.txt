A biology student hiking in a forest happens upon an erect, 15-centimeter-tall plant that bears microphylls and a strobilus at its tallest point.

BONUS: critical thinking (4 pts) A biologist studied a population of squirrels for fifteen years. During that time, the population always fell between 30 - 45 squirrels. Her data showed that over half of the squirrels born did not survive to reproduce, because of both competition for food and predation. Recently, in a single generation (the sixteenth year), 90% of the squirrels that were born lived to reproduce, and the population increased to eighty. What can we infer about this recent surge in the population size? (E.g. What is the best explanation for this increase?)

Nos habla Raquel... En mi familia, con mis padres, somos seis. Tengo tres hermanos y yo soy la unica chica - y la mayor. El menor se llama Daniel y es ocho anos menor que yo.  Tenemos un perro y a todos nos gusta. Se llama Felipe. Los domingos lo banamos en el jardin. Felipe duerme en el garaje. Mi padre siempre pasea al perro en el parque porque hay otros perros con quien Felipe puede jugar. Tambien le gusta jugar con el balon de futbol, pero mis hermanos se enfadan porque a veces Felipe rompe el balon con los dientes.

Ellos tienen dos gatos y !Daniel lo pasa bomba!     Adapted from Cambridge 0530/02/SP/21

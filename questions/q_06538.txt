Consider the simple electric machine shown below.  All dimensions are given in meters.  The depth (or dimension into the page) of both the stationary member and the rotor is 0.15 m.    Also assume that the 1000 turn coil is fed from a constant current source of 10 A.  Neglect all fringing effects (that is, the area through which the flux flows across the air gaps is constant and equal to the cross sectional area of the stationary member).  The stationary member of the machine has a core with a relative permeability of 5500.  The rotor can be assumed to have an infinite permeability.     If g = 50 mm, determine the torque acting on the rotor.  Now suppose that the airgap varies with the angle of the rotor such that g = .07cos q.   Find the voltage, v(t), at the coil terminals if the coil current is equal to 10 A dc and the rotor rotates such that q is a function of time given by, q = 5t rad.

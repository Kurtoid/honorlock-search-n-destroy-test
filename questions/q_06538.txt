If an enzyme-catalyzed reaction has a low rate at low pH and high rate at higher pH, this implies that a group on either the enzyme or the substrate must be __[1]__ for an efficient reaction.   On a transition state diagram for a multistep reaction, the step with the greatest Ea is the __[2]__    Metal ion cofactors can coordinate to the substrate or stabilize electrostatic effects by enabling proper __[3]__in the active site.   Since proteins are limited in their abilities to catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions, enzymes often employ __[4]__ to assist with catalysis.   Clustering several amino acid residues with appropriate pK values at an active site can promote a(n) __[5]__ catalytic mechanism.

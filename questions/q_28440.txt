Mechanics of Breathing Hybrid. Use the answer bank below and type in a letter only, nothing else. Answers can be used more than once. While not breathing the pressure inside the lungs is equal to the pressure in the [1](1). In order for resting inspiration to occur the [2](2) muscle contracts leading to a [3](3) in the volume of the lungs  which leads to a [4](4) in the pressure  of the lungs.  Now the pressure in the atmosphere is [5](5) than the pressure in the lungs and this leads to air flowing [6](6) the lungs. In order for forced or active expiration to occur the [7](7: choose any expiratory muscle) muscle  contracts leading to a [8](8) in the volume of the lungs  which leads to a [9](9) in the pressure  of the lungs.  Now the pressure in the atmosphere is [10](10) than the pressure in the lungs and this leads to air flowing [11](11) the lungs. These changes in pressure and volume are all happening according to [12] (12: a gas law) law.     A. Increase   E. Diaphragm   I. Sternocleidomastoid   M. Boyle's   Q. Into     B. Decrease   F.

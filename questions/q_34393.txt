For each part of this question, I will give hypothetical scenarios that change what traits are encoded by the R and Y genes from Q1. For each scenario, you will tell me what the ratio of phenotype classes is for the F2 generation of a dihybrid F1 self cross (use the Punnett Square from Q1) A) Y: Y - Yellow peas dominant, y - green peas recessive (same as above)                R:  R - Pigmented (dominant), r - no pigment (recessive). Recessively epistatic to Y. B) Y: Y - Yellow peas (dominant), y - green peas (recessive)                R: R - Smooth peas (recessive), r - is dominant for wrinkled peas, recessive lethal C) Y and R encode two separate enzymes that are both required for roundness. y and r both recessive for wrinkled phenotype D)          Y and R each encode two redundant enzymes that catalyze the same reaction: conversion of green pigment to yellow pigment. y and r are recessive null alleles.

On February 1, 2020 (t = 0, today), a company is interested in purchasing 1-year zero coupon Treasury bond with the proceeds of a sale of equipment ($200 million dollars) to take place on February 1, 2021 (The maturity date of the 1-year zero coupon Treasury bond is February 1, 2022). The company is interested in locking in the price of the Treasuries today through a forward contract. Using the forward contract, the company is planning to invest all of the proceeds of a sale of equipment ($200M). You observe the following zero-coupon bond prices (with F = $100 and maturity T) on February 1, 2020.    t T     0 0.5 98.2   0 1.0 96.2   0 1.5 94.0   0 2.0 91.5   0 2.5 89.2   0 3.0 86.7      (a) What would be the forward price (i.e. the fair value: , per 1-unit) of a 1-year zero coupon treasury bond (with M = February 1, 2022)?  Assume that the face value of the bond is $100.   : [answer1]   (b) Suppose you observe that a bank quotes the following forward price for a 1-year zero coupon bond: , which allows you to buy or short-sell the bond at the quoted forward price after 1-year from now. Is there an arbitrage opportunity? If there is, how would you take advantage of it? Describe the exact transactions that you need to make in order to obtain an arbitrage profit. Note: please assume that you would like to generate positive cash-flows today and no other cash flows in the future.  (Step 1.)  You [answer2] 1-unit of the 1-year zero coupon bond at the bank's quoted forward price at .  (Step 2.) You [answer3] [answer4]-units of a 1-year zero coupon bond at . (Step 3.) You [answer5] 1-unit of a 2-year zero coupon bond at . (Step 4.) As a result, your take the arbitrage profit of $[answer6] today, with no other cash flows in the future.    (c) Today (t=0), February 1, 2020, you enter into a forward rate agreement (FRA) with a bank for the period starting February 1, 2021 to August 1, 2021. Notional amount is $200 million dollars. You enter the FRA as a payer of the fixed rate () and a receiver of the floating rate (). Both rates are semiannually compounded interest rates. What is the value of the FRA at inception (t = 0)? [answer7] Six months later (August 1, 2020 or t = 0.5), you have second thoughts and consider that maybe you should get out of the transaction. You observe the new term structure of interest rates as follows.     t T     0.5 1.0 0.985   0.5 1.5 0.975   0.5 2.0 0.965   0.5 2.5 0.955    What is the value of the FRA on August 1, 2020?[answer8]

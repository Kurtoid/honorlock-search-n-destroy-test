Questions 51 - 53 refer to the following excerpt.      "No thoughtful person can question that the American economic system is under broad attack. This varies in scope, intensity, in the techniques employed, and in the level of visibility.  "There always have been some who opposed the American system. . . .  "But what now concerns us is quite new in the history of America. We are not dealing with sporadic or isolated attacks from a relatively few extremists or even from the minority socialist cadre. Rather, the assault on the enterprise system is broadly based and consistently pursued. . . .  "The most disquieting voices joining the chorus of criticism come from perfectly respectable elements of society: from the college campus, the pulpit, the media, the intellectual and literary journals, the arts and sciences, and from politicians."  - Memorandum from Lewis F.

The Ivy Club ("Ivy" or "Club"), a social eating organization whose membership is drawn primarily from the student body of Princeton University, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging that the exercise of jurisdiction by the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights, Department of Law and Public Safety (the "Division") violated its first amendment rights to freedom of association and its constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy. Following the federal court's stay of the federal suit, Ivy returned to the state court proceedings, but thereafter refrained from litigating its federal claims.             Ivy, founded more than a century ago, is a social eating club with an active membership of less than eighty undergraduate students at Princeton University and approximately fifteen hundred inactive graduate members who formerly attended the University. The Club is one of thirteen eating clubs which provide meals to a portion of upper class Princeton students. Until recently, Ivy's membership was all male.             This litigation commenced in 2015 when Sally Frank, then a student at Princeton University, filed a complaint with the Division against Ivy, as well as two other eating clubs, the Tiger Inn and the University Cottage Club ("the Clubs"), and Princeton University. Frank alleged that the Clubs and Princeton University discriminated on the basis of sex in places of public accommodation in violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination ("LAD").             The Division initially refused to process Frank's complaint, stating that it had determined that the Clubs were exempt from LAD because the Clubs were not places of public accommodation. LAD does not apply to "any institution, bona fide club, or place of accommodation, which is in its nature distinctly private."             In December of 2016, Frank filed another complaint with the Division, this time alleging that the Clubs were places of public accommodations because they functioned as an arm of Princeton University. Ivy's answer to the complaint stated as a separate defense that Ivy "has the right to freedom of association pursuant to the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution." The Division dismissed Frank's complaint, holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the Clubs because of their distinctly private nature.             Frank appealed the dismissal of her complaint to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey. Once again, the Clubs raised the defense of freedom of association guaranteed by the United States Constitution. The appellate division, taking no position on the merits of the complaint, vacated the decision by the Division and remanded the case for further investigation, holding that a hearing and factual findings were necessary to determine whether the Division had jurisdiction.             After a number of procedural skirmishes not relevant to the dispute at hand, on February 6, 2018, the Division issued a Partial Summary Decision, holding that the Division had jurisdiction over the Clubs. The decision affirmed an earlier ruling of the Division in which the Director of the Division rejected the Club's argument that the exercise of jurisdiction by the Division violated their first amendment right to freedom of association. In a discussion covering six pages, the Director held that the application of LAD to the Clubs did not violate their constitutional right to freedom of association.             On February 13, 2018, following this final determination of jurisdiction at the administrative level, and having had its constitutional defenses against the exercise of jurisdiction rejected, Ivy and the Tiger Inn filed suit in federal court. The complaint alleged that the exercise of jurisdiction by the Division of Civil Rights violated the Clubs' civil rights under the federal constitution and requested a declaratory judgment and an injunction against the state proceedings. The defendants were Attorney General W. Cary Edwards and Director of Civil Rights Pamela Poff.             The federal court chose to stay the federal action "until the New Jersey courts have clarified the application of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination to the plaintiffs." Although the plaintiffs requested the court to exercise its equitable powers in restraining the state proceedings, the court stayed the action pursuant to the Pullman doctrine, rather than the Younger doctrine. The court explicitly declined to rule whether the plaintiffs were entitled to return to federal court upon the conclusion of the state proceedings. The court cautioned Ivy and Tiger Inn "not to interpret the court's decision to grant a stay as a ruling that they have properly reserved their federal constitutional claims for federal court adjudication pursuant to England."             The Ivy Club and Tiger Inn then resumed litigating at the state level. Ivy thereafter refrained from raising its federal constitutional claims in the state proceedings. It explicitly stated that it wished to reserve its right to litigate its federal claims in federal court pursuant to the England doctrine. Ivy reserved its rights orally before the Administrative Law Judge and again in its brief to the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court. Tiger Inn, on the other hand, continued to present its federal claims in the state proceedings.             On July 3, 2019, the Supreme Court of New Jersey rendered its final decision. The court affirmed the Division's Order, awarded Frank humiliation damages in the amount of $5,000, but denied her club membership. It also ordered Ivy and Tiger Inn to admit women as members.             The decision, concerned primarily with the extent of hearings necessary to satisfy administrative due process, did not discuss federal constitutional claims. The only mention the New Jersey Supreme Court made of any federal constitutional claims was in its summary of the procedural history where the court noted that "the Division rejected the argument that the Club members' constitutional free-association rights would be violated if the Clubs were subject to LAD."             On October 1, 1990, Tiger Inn filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming that the decision of the Supreme Court of New Jersey violated its first amendment rights. Although Ivy filed a motion for an extension of time to file its petition in the Supreme Court, Ivy never filed a petition. On January 18, 2020, the Supreme Court denied Tiger's petition for certiorari.             In the fall of 2020, Ivy formally inducted its first female members.             On January 19, 2020, Ivy and Tiger Inn moved to reopen its federal action based on the 2018 complaint. You are the federal district court judge assigned to this case. The parties have filed motions and briefs addressing the preliminary jurisdictional issues of standing, mootness, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. Write your opinion addressing the jurisdictional issues necessary to determine whether you should reach the merits of Ivy and Tiger Inn's suit.

A Framework for Public Health Action: The Health Impact Pyramid Thomas R. Frieden, MD, MPH We discussed Frieden's 5-tier pyramid to describe the impact of different types of public health interventions to improve health.

The more effective interventions  reach broader segments of society and require less individual effort.  Which intervention section of the Frieden 5-tier pyramid has the least potential impact and which has the greatest potential impact to improve population health?

A population of squirrels inhabiting South Florida was severely affected by a surge of great eagles, which are considered one of their biggest predators. This led to nearly  3/4  of the population dying. After this occurred, we would like to study whether the survivors were affected by inbreeding. Data was collected on the optimal speed of squirrels in this population. FF(fast)= 17FS(medium speed)= 9SS(slow)= 13The population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. If we consider these results Generation 1, what are the expected number of individuals for each genotype in Generation 3 if we have only inbreeding, that is, FF only reproduces with FF; FS only reproduces with FS; and SS only reproduces with SS? FF = [FF] FS = [FS] SS = [SS]

The weak organic molecular base morpholine C4H9NO has a conjugate acid with a pKa of 8.83. The related acidic salt morpholinium chloride HC4H9NOCl has a molar mass of 87.12 g/mol.  Give all your answers with correct sig figs. Use unrounded values in calculations. Use decimal form if the power is less than 4. Use E format if it's 4 or larger (no spaces, i.e. 1.23E-4). For decimal numbers less than 1, you must put the zero in front of the decimal point, i.e. 0.0123, not .0123. For full credit, you must show work on your upload similar to the method shown in lecture, with an ICE table including assumptions made and validated.  A 7.85 g sample of morpholinium chloride is dissolved to make 100.0 mL of solution. What is the pH of this solution? [ph] What is the % dissociation in this solution? Give in E format, no % sign. [percent] % What is the concentration of ALL species in solution at equilibrium? Use E format for all of the following answers if the power of ten is +/- 4 or larger. Do NOT include Units. [ morpholinium ] =[ha] M [ H3O+ ] = [h] M [ morpholine ] = [a] M [ OH- ] = [oh] M [ Cl- ] = [cl] M

Dr. Germs conducted an experiment to determine if there is a difference in the bacterial count left on a person's hands after using one of four different types of cleaning methods; Alcohol Spray, Antibacterial Soap, Soap, and Water only.  The results of the Tukey post hoc test are given below. Tukey HSD results (95% level) Alcohol Spray Bacterial Counts subtracted from     Difference Lower Upper P-value     Antibacterial Soap Bacterial Counts 55 3.7358488 106.26415 0.032   Soap Bacterial Counts 68.5 17.235849 119.76415 0.0056   Water Bacterial Counts 79.5 28.235849 130.76415 0.0012    Antibacterial Soap Bacterial Counts subtracted from     Difference Lower Upper P-value     Soap Bacterial Counts 13.5 -37.764151 64.764151 0.8887   Water Bacterial Counts 24.5 -26.764151 75.764151 0.5676    Soap Bacterial Counts subtracted from     Difference Lower Upper P-value     Water Bacterial Counts 11 -40.264151 62.264151 0.9355    a. Please under what condition it is appropriate to run a Tukey post hoc test. [answer1] Select either TRUE or FALSE for the following statements.        b.

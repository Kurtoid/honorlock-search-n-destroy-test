Why would a leader seek approval from an IO for a military endeavor, even if they are powerful enough to conduct the activity on their own? According to Chapman (2007), which types of IOs are likely to be more useful in this goal? Use a historical example to support your answer.

In a dataset of 1000 transaction we counted the occurrence of three items: Tea (T), Coffee (C), and Hot Chocolate (H). The counts are as follows: T occurred in 600 transactions C occurred in 750 transactions H occurred in 250 transactions T and C together occurred in 500 transactions T and H together occurred in 200 transactions C and H occurred together in 400 transactions T, C and H occurred together in 60 transaction Answer the following questions:   (a) (8) What are the Confidence and Lift values for the rules: (T and C -> H), and (T -> C). Clearly label the values you list.   (b) (8) Find an association rule (other than the two listed  in part (a) above) which you think is a good candidate for being a useful rule. Explain why you think this is a good and useful rule.

Fill in the code to implement the following Moore finite state machine (FSM) using the 2-process FSM model. Assume that INIT is the initial state. Transitions that are not explicitly shown (e.g. INIT when a = '0') mean that the state machine stays in the same state.         library ieee;use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;use ieee.numeric_std.all;entity fsm is    port (        clk, rst, a : in  std_logic;        output      : out std_logic_vector(1 downto 0)        );end fsm;architecture default of fsm is    type state_type is (INIT, STATE1, STATE2);    signal state, next_state : state_type;    begin    process(clk, rst)    begin        -- BEGIN REGION 1        -- END REGION 1    end process;   process(...) --REGION 2 (specify sensitivity list)   begin             -- BEGIN REGION 3            -- END REGION 3    end process;    end default;

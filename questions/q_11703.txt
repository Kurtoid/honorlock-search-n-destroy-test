Problem 5  TI Axles manufactures axles for multiple auto manufacturers. The following probability distribution shows the machine breakdown in a given week:    Machine Breakdowns  Probability Cumulative Probability Random Numbers   0 .05 0.05 1-5   1 .10 0.15 6-15   2 .25 0.40 16-40   3 .34 0.74 41-74   4 .26 1.00 75-99, 00    Use the following random numbers to determine the number of machine breakdowns: 03        39        16        79        13        62        42        81        Every time a machine breaks down, one to three hours are required to fix it. The distribution for the machine repair time is provided below:    Repair Time (hours) Probability Cumulative Probability Random Numbers   1 .30 0.30 1-30   2 .40 0.70 31-70   3 .30 1.00 71-99, 00    Use as many numbers as you may need from the following random numbers to determine the repair time [start with first row (85, 32, 64, 90 and so on). If you  finish the first row, then move to the second row (63, 88, 55, 46 and so on) and use the third row of random numbers last].    85 32 64 90 73 02 76 03 86 67   63 88 55 46 55 69 13 17 36 81   02 87 98 10 47 93 21 95 97 69    Simulate the machine breakdowns and repair process for 4 weeks in the following table: IMPORTANT: Only numbers (and if necessary, punctuation (e.g. comma)) in the table below. If you need to write notes for me, you may do so in the next question/space    Week # Machine Breakdowns Repair Time   Random number(s) used Breakdowns Random number(s) used Time   1 [A] [B] [C] [D]   2 [E] [F] [G] [H]   3 [I] [J] [K] [L]   4 [M] [N] [O] [P]    You may write your notes on your simulation, if you so wish, in the next question, space VERY IMPORTANT: Please show the front and back of your scratch sheets in full view of the webcam and then shred them to tiny pieces BEFORE you leave the honorlock session. Failing to do this is a serious offence.

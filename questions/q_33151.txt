The current price of oil is $50 a barrel.  Assume I can buy oil and store it in an oil tanker for a total storage three month storage cost of $2 per barrel.  The storage costs include all costs associated with transport and insurance of oil.   There is a 3 month T-bill that guarantees a return for 3 months.  The price of the T-bill is $990.099 and pays $1000 in 3 months.  So, the guaranteed return = 1% over 3 months, since (1 + Rf) = (1.01) = 1000/990.099. What would be the highest possible forward price (in dollars) for delivery of a barrel of oil in 3 months that insures there is no arbitrage incentive to sell T-bills, buy oil, store the oil, and agree to deliver the oil in three months at the forward price. Just answer in number of dollars and cents  (example;  if answer was $80.25, put in 80.25)

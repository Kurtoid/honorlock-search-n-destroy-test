5. A 1,200-gram mass is pushed down a rough circular track (Radius = 200 cm) as shown in figure 5. The speed of the mass at point A is 3.2 m/s, and at point B, it is 6.0 m/s. a. Determine the angular velocity of the mass at point A. b. Determine the energy lost to friction from point A to point B. c. Describe how the normal force on the mass varies as it travels from point A to point B. Justify your answer. Test #3 Figure Q5.pdf

WORKOUT PROBLEM starts here: (Nothing to submit here, just read the problem. Some of the homework format/layout is already provided)   A ball is shot vertically upward with a speed of 35 m/s. The ball will travel upwards reaching some maximum height before falling back to the ground. We will focus only on the travel upward, from launch to the apex. If we split the maximum height in half, we are comparing the amount of time to travel up the first half of the distance with the amount of time to travel the second half of the distance. Given: A ball shot upwards.  Find:  Calculate the maximum height the ball travels from launch to its apex. You MUST follow the multi-step process shown in class and you must use units! Determine the time it takes to go half way up. Again, you MUST follow the multi-step process shown in class and you must use units! Find the time it takes to go the second half of the distance. Must use units!    Assume: Answer the following set of questions.
Mr. Brandon, a 36 year old male comes to your office with complaints of "this headaches that comes out of nowhere intensifying to a level where I have to take a break from work even when I am in the middle of something important." He describes the head ache as severe, stabbing, and throbbing that alternate sides with each episode. Every time he gets it, he gets it more than once per day. Mr. Brandon is most likely describing:

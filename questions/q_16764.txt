On average 90 eggs are killed when zombie hunters shoot the zombies in the head.  Of the survivors about 80 larvae die by falling out of all the random holes in the rotting zombies and another 30 pupae die from the nicotine levels in zombies that were formerly smokers.

Can this fly save us from the zombie apocalypse? (worth 10)

Dawn, a 19 year old woman with no criminal record lives in an apartment with her dog Fluffy and her boyfriend Bill. A year ago Bill began buying and selling illegal drugs. One day Bill asked Dawn to deliver a plastic bag containing a white powder to a house on Main Street. Dawn believed the bag contained cocaine and refused, saying, "I wish you would stop dealing cocaine. I want nothing to do with your dirty business." Bill flew into a rage. He said, "I am sick and tired of your superior attitude. If you don't deliver this bag, then I am going to kill Fluffy." He then grabbed the dog and held a knife against its side until Fluffy began to squeal. Afraid for Fluffy's well-being, Dawn agreed to deliver the bag and its contents. She put the bag in her purse, got into her car, and drove towards Main Street. She drove very carefully and within the posted speed limit to avoid getting stopped by the police. As she approached Main Street, a two-year-old boy, Victor, darted out in front of Dawn's car. Her car struck Victor before she had a chance to apply her brakes. Victor was killed immediately by the impact. While still at the accident scene, the police arrived and arrested Dawn, who immediately screamed "my boyfriend is going to kill Fluffy, please rescue her!" In searching her purse they discovered the white powder. Chemical analysis revealed that the white powder was cocaine. What could Dawn be charged with? What defenses could she use? Are the charges or defenses likely to succeed? Why? Use all relevant case law.

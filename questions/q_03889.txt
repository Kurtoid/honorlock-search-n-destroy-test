Each block has an interior black border 5 pixels thick, rest of the block is yellow (RGB = [255 255 0].  Given the number of blocks (n) in the base of a pyramid, write a program that displays a pyramid with n base blocks that is also n blocks high as shows in the test cases below. Your image output should have a black background. (Note that blocks are present next to each other without any distance in between and every block has an interior 5 pixels thick black border. An image with n=2 will have size 200 pixels by 200 pixels and similarly an image with n = 5 will have size 500*500 pixels).  n = input('Enter the number of base blocks n: '); In case the images do not show up in the following test cases, download this pdf: LINK Test Case 1: Enter the number of base blocks n: 1  Test Case 2: Enter the number of base blocks n: 2  Test Case 3: Enter the number of base blocks n: 3  Test Case 4: Enter the number of base blocks n: 5  Test Case 5:  Enter the number of base blocks n: 10

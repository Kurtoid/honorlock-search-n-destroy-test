You may annotate and include diagrams in your answers.     1.1.   A bright future for Mongolia?    Economists predict that the Asian economy of Mongolia will be the fastest-growing economy between 2015 and 2020. In 2011, the country's economic growth rate was 21%. The forecast annual growth rate for 2015 to 2020 is 24%.   The country is rich in a range of minerals including coal, copper, gold, silver and uranium. China purchases large quantities of these minerals. In 2011, there was a significant rise in the world demand for a range of minerals including copper. Some economists have pointed out that there are a number of risks attached to an economic boom caused by a rise in demand for minerals. One is the so-called 'resources curse'. This refers to the disadvantage that can arise as natural resources are used. High international demand for minerals can push up the exchange rate and reduce the competitiveness of other industries. The extraction of minerals can also cause pollution. This is certainly the case in Mongolia. The capital city, Ulaanbaatar, is one of the most polluted cities in the world.   The Mongolian economy faces a number of other problems. Its inflation rate is relatively high, reaching 10.6% in 2011, driven up by increases in food prices and rises in government spending. Its unemployment rate, at 10% in the same year, was above that of some of its Asian neighbours. This led it to be placed relatively high in the region's 'misery index'. This index, developed by the American economist Arthur Okun, adds together the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. Table 1 shows the unemployment rate, misery index, and interest rate for a number of Asian economies. Right-click on the button below to see Table 1    Nearly 40% of Mongolia's population lives below the poverty line. However, with rising economic growth, income levels are increasing. Indeed, some economists are predicting that Mongolians will become very rich. Tax revenue will also rise, which will enable the government to increase its spending on, for instance, education. Higher spending on education will make it possible for children to spend more years in school.     (1)     1.1.1   Define 'economic growth'.   (3)     1.1.2   Using information from the extract, explain why Mongolia's Human Development Index value is likely to increase in the future.   (2)     1.1.3   Using information from the extract, draw a demand and supply diagram to show what is likely to have happened to the price of copper in 2011.   (4)     1.1.4   Explain why countries with high inflation rates tend to have higher interest rates than those with lower inflation rates.   (3)     1.1.5   Analyze whether the information in Table 1 supports the view that countries with high inflation rates have higher interest rates than those with lower inflation rates.   (5)     1.1.6   Discuss whether a rise in a country's exchange rate will reduce its international competitiveness.   (6)     1.1.7   Using information from the extract, explain why the social costs of mining are higher than the private costs of mining in Mongolia.   (2)     1.1.8   Discuss whether a rise in income in a country will always increase tax revenue.   (5)         Total SECTION A   [30]

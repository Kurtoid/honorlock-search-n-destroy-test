Estimate the following addition problem by rounding each number to the nearest thousand, then to the nearest hundred (remember: enter no commas!) 3764 + 4668 If we round each number to the nearest thousand, we would add 4000 + [5000] = [9000].   If we round each number to the nearest hundred, then the first number becomes [3800] and the second number becomes [4700].  Adding these numbers together gives a total of [8500].   Notice when we rounded each number to the nearest hundred we got a better estimate for the exact sum of 8432.

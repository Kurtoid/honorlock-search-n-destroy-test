2. In addition to the respiratory crisis, cardiac problems include right heart overload (i.e pulmonary hypertension), and low left ventricular ejection fraction. c.

Remember to write equations and show all your work (no pun intended). A gnome named Herve, mass = 6.7 kg,  slides down a frictionless slope, from a height of 4.0 m above the base.  He starts with initial velocity v0 = 5.4 m/s down the slope.  At the base of the slope, on level ground, he hits a rough patch and slows down.  The rough patch is 4.4 m across and the coefficients of friction between the floor and the gnome are mk = 0.42 and ms = 0.50. Find Herve's kinetic energy, K (in Joules), after the rough patch.

Abdulla: Please submit eh answer to this particular problem by uploading your answer here Consider receptors located in a balcony 140 m above the ground. This location is situated 2,000 m downwind and 250 m crosswind from a factory releasing a nonreactive pollutant from a stack at a rate of 300 g/s. The stack is 90 m tall, and the plume rise is 45 meters. Calculate the concentration at the location of the receptors if the release occurs on a clear night, over a rural terrain, and the wind speed (measured at 10 m height) is 2.5 m/s. Determine: The Pasquill stability class, the wind-speed at stack height, the dispersion coefficients in meters (sigma-y, sigma-z), the pollutant concentration at the receptors location (micrograms/cubic meter)

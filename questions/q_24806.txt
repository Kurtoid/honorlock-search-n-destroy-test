QUESTION 5         An escape lane is an emergency area placed next to a steep, downhill section of a road. It allows vehicles with brake failure to slow down and stop away from the other traffic. One type of escape lane uses a gravity ramp. These are built with an upwards gradient to slow the vehicle.    Right click on the button to open the photograph of a gravity ramp in a new window.         5.1   Explain how using the ramp enables a vehicle to stop.   (2)         An escape lane consists of a ramp at an angle of 10deg to the horizontal and is 180 m in length. A lorry of mass 2.8 x 103 kg enters the escape lane due to brake failure.   Right click on the button to open a diagram of the ramp in a new window.           5.2   Show that the component of the weight of the lorry parallel to the ramp is about 5 x 103 N.   (3)     5.3   The lorry uses the full length of the ramp while stopping and the frictional force of the road surface can be assumed to be negligible.  Calculate the maximum work done on the lorry bringing it to rest.   (4)     5.4   Calculate the maximum speed of the lorry so that it could be stopped by the ramp.   (3)

(4)     4.6   Noem die binding wat tussen natrium en chloor vorm.   (1)     4.7   'n Chlooratoom kan ook aan 'n ander chlooratoom bind om 'n molekule te vorm.         4.7.1   Definieer die term molekule.   (1)     4.7.2   Noem die tipe binding wat tussen TWEE chlooratome vorm.   (1)     4.7.3   Stel die chloormolekule voor met 'n Lewis-diagram.   (2)     4.8   As 'n monster 75% chloor-35 en 25% chloor-37 bevat, bereken die relatiewe atoommassa van 'n atoom in die monster.   (3)     4.9   Definieer die term isotoop.   (2)             [23]

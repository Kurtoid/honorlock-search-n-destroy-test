Work on this problem should be submitted to the Test #2 work submission link on Canvas Text #2 Module no more than 15 minutes after the completion of this Quiz. A block and sphere are connected by a cord that passes over a pulley as shown in the figure below. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the incline is 0.23 and assume the cord is massless. Take m1 = 1.00 kg, m2 = 5.25 kg, and th = 35.6deg. Answer the following questions.     Include free body diagrams for the block and sphere in your solution. What is the magnitude of the acceleration (in m/s2) of the block as it falls along the incline? [2 pts.] What is the tension (in N) in the cord? [1.5 pts.] What is the speed (in m/s) of each object when the block reaches the bottom of the incline if they released from rest at the position shown in the figure? [1.5 pts.]

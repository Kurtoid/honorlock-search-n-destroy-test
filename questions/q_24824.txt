Problem 4 (7 points) Consider a medical test for a certain disease. If a person has the disease, the test results are positive with probability 0.95. The prevalence of the disease (probability that a randomly selected person has the disease) is 30%.  What should the probability for a true negative be such that the test predictive value of the test is 80%?  A true negative measures the probability of a negative test given that the person does not have the disease. A test's predictive value measures the probability that a person has the disease given that they tested positive.  Show your work.

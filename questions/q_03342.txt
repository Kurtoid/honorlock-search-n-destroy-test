Use the scenario below to answer the following two questions.   The BCA assay is commonly used to determine the total protein concentration in a sample when compared to a protein reference standard. Assay samples containing protein change color from a pale green (little or no protein present) to purple (protein present) upon incubation. The purple coloration, which is directly proportional to the amount of protein present, has a maximum absorbance at 562 nm, so it can be measured on a spectrophotometer.  Your supervisor would like you to use the data provided below to plot the concentration vs. absorbance and generate a standard curve for the protein reference standard Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), to be included in the BCA assay your supervisor has asked you to perform.     BSA Conc. mg/mL Absorbance (at 562 nm)   0.0 0.0   1.0 3.3   2.5 4.9   5.0 10.2   7.5 15.1   10.0 20.3

Label this question Q-Nitrogen on your paper. (5 min) Show all your work on your paper including starting equations, starting variables, units, and correct sig figs.  Circle your final answer.  Use one equation dimensional analysis where applicable.  You must upload your work to the Canvas dropbox for grading.  If a 2.00 L container is filled with N2 to a pressure of 990. torr at 43.0degC, calculate the mass of the nitrogen in the container. N = nitrogen, Atomic Mass = 14.007 g/mol R = 0.0821 L atm/mol K 1.00 atm = 760. torr Place your final answer here.

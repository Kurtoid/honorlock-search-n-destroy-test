Rules for the test:  You must sit at a desk or table. You must be alone in the room where you are taking the test. If someone walks in or something happens, a parent comes in and says something, just explain it to the webcam.  I will be able to check it and verify. You are not permitted to use notes, books, cell phones, other computers, or other people assistance. This should be treated like an in-class test.  Do not attempt to receive help from anyone else.  No cell phones are allowed to be visible or on the desk/table. Cell phones should not be on the table where you are taking the quiz/test.  If your cell phone rings and you answer it (unless it is an emergency), you will get a zero on the quiz/test.  If you are texting on your cell phone (unless it is an emergency and you prove it by showing it to the webcam), then you will get a zero on the quiz/test.   Please be appropriately dressed. Remember the webcam is on, so please wear clothing that covers areas you do not want seen and that others do not want to see. You must do a complete 360-degree scan of the room where you are taking the quiz or test. Be sure you show all sides of the room to the camera. You will do the 360-degree scan when prompted by Honor Lock. You will need to show your Longwood ID at the beginning before taking your test when prompted by Honor Lock. It is your responsibility to prove that you are abiding by these rules. So please do not do anything that would cause me to question your behavior. If you are caught cheating on the test, you will receive a zero on the test, may receive a zero in the course, and I will turn you into the Honor Board. If there is an issue, please just speak into the camera and explain it. I will have access to verify what you are saying. For example, if your mom comes into the room telling you to do the dishes. Just explain to her you are taking an online test and say into the screen, "I am sorry...my mom came into the room....etc."  If something happens to the test, it will be recorded, so I will be able to verify.  If you have any issues, you can click the chat button and the online proctor will answer immediately and help troubleshoot.  Remember the University's Honor Code: "We shall not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do."   Best of Luck! I have read, and will abide the "Rules for the test", and the University's Honor Code.

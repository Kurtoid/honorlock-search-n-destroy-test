[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).] A 735-N man is standing on a scale in an elevator which is moving downward with an initial speed of 7.0 m/s, and 3.0 seconds later, is moving downward at 15 m/s. a. Draw a clearly labeled free body diagram showing all the forces acting on the man.  b. Draw a clearly labeled dot diagram for the man's motion. c. Calculate the normal force acting on the man during the time described above. d. What distance did the elevator travel in the 3.0-second time interval described? Note: Be sure to choose a coordinate system and use it throughout this problem. [Enter the answers for c and d in the box below.  Immediately following the exam, you will upload your work for all four parts, including your FBDs, with your coordinate system clearly labeled]

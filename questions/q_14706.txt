Brenda, a basketball coach at a local high school, consulted Mike the Attorney about a possible defamation claim. Brenda told Mike that a high profile reporter had written an article, which was subsequently published in the local newspaper, alleging that she practiced inappropriate coaching tactics, throwing basketballs at the children's heads. According to Brenda, these statements were entirely untrue, but parents had complained, and Brenda was now under investigation by the school board.   Based on Brenda's representations, Mike the Attorney drafted a complaint against both the reporter and the newspaper. The complaint alleged that the reporter and newspaper had defamed Brenda by making untrue statements about her, either knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth, and that Brenda had suffered damages in the form of loss of parental confidence and the school board investigation. After Brenda reviewed the complaint, Mike the Attorney signed it and filed it with the Court. However, Brenda had misstated the content of the article, and no school board investigation had commenced; she merely feared that one might occur.   Which of the following is true?

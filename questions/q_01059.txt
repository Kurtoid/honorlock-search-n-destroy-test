In Dexter and Kerry cattle, animals may be polled (hornless) or horned. When many offspring were obtained from matings between polled Kerrys and horned Dexters, one-half were found to be polled Dexters and one-half polled Kerrys. When these two types of F1 cattle were bred with one another, the following F2 data were obtained: 3/8 polled Dexters, 3/8 polled Kerrys, 1/8 normal Dexters, 1/8 normal Kerrys. A geneticist was puzzled by these data and interviewed farmers who had bred these cattle for decades. She learned that Kerrys were true-breeding. Dexters, on the other hand, were not true-breeding and never produced as many offspring as Kerrys. Using symbols explain the inheritance of the traits and explain why Dexters are not true breeding.

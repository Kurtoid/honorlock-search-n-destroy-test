The following are the main steps in the generation of an action potential.  Sodium channels are inactivated. Voltage-gated potassium channels open and potassium moves out of the cell, initiating repolarization. Sodium channels regain their normal properties. A graded depolarization brings an area of an excitable membrane to threshold. A temporary hyperpolarization occurs. Sodium channel activation occurs. Sodium ions enter the cell and depolarization occurs  What is the proper sequence of these events?

Problem 1. Hot water at an average temperature of 90 oC is flowing through a 15-m section of a cast iron pipe (k= 52 W/m.K) whose inner and outer diameters are 4 cm and 4.6 cm, respectively. The outer surface of the pipe is exposed to the cold air at 10 oC in the basement with a heat transfer coefficient of 15 W/m2.K. The heat transfer coefficient at the inner surface of the pipe is 120 W/m2.K. Taking the basement temperature to be at 10 oC, determine (a) the rate of heat loss from the hot water, and (b) the surface temperature of the pipe. (c) If the emissivity of the pipe is 0.7, how will this impact the heat loss from the pipe compared to when you did not consider the emissivity?

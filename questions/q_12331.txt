Tower Hall is a 357-year old manor which has been converted to a lovely inn. Many articles have been written for the past 100 years that "The Duchess", who was alleged to have died under suspicious circumstances somewhere at the Hall, regularly visits rooms 42, 142, 242, 342, and 343, and goes through the guests' bags and belongings. The Duchess never takes anything; she just moves things around. Interestingly the Duchess has never been observed in action; rather, when the guests are out-and-about hiking or skiing in the lush hills and vales around the Hall, the Duchess pays her visits. Of late, the stories about the Duchess have faded from popular legend, although the Power family who owns the Hall maintains a desk journal in the office which recounts the Duchess' activities over the years. The Powers have entered a purchase and sale agreement to sell the Hall to MiniEvil, LLC During the 90-day inspection period the Tower's owners have a duty to disclose this _____________________  impairment to MiniEvil.

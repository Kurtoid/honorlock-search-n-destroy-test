A swimmer is upright in water and notices they are moving up and down periodically, owning to waves on the surface of the water. It takes them 2.5 s to travel from their crest to trough, a total distance of 53 cm. The swimmer sees the wave crest are spaced 4.8 m apart. If their total vertical distance traveled changes to 30 cm but all other data remains the same, how does the wavelength change?

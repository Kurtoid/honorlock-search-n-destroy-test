Problem Set #4: The HAL computing produces two types of main frame computers. For the next production cycle there are orders for 5 type 1, 6 type 2 and 4 type 3 computers. All of the different types of computers use the same frame for mounting the processors, memory and connectors to the peripheral devices. For the next cycle there is no limit on any of the required components except the frames were there are only 12 available. The sales price of type 1 computer is $4,000,000, $6,000,000 for a type 2 and $8,000,000 for a type 3. It takes 1000 hours of labor to produce a type 1, 1200 hours to produce a type 2 and 1500 hours for a type 3. There are 14,000 hours available which are cost at $50 per hour. Materials are estimated to be 50% of the sales price. Management would like to produce at least 7 computers with at least one of each type as part of the production mix.   Using problem set 4, what would be constraint(s) for the number of available frames?      (X1 = number of type 1 computers, X2 =number of type 2 computers, X3 = number of type 3 computers)

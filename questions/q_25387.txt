A product requires 4 widgets per completed unit.  The production of one widget requires 0.25 pounds of raw material.  The widget making process has a scrap rate of 10%.  Additionally, there is 15% cutting scrap associated with the process.  If you need to produce 1000 completed units, how much raw material should be ordered?  Explain your answer.

In regard to the car wash process, please answer the following 2 questions. (See the previous question and your response below). Question is worth a total of 5 points. A. A new employee is hired by the car wash to increase system capacity. No other changes can be made to the process. To which workstation would you assign this new worker?  Explain why you would assign them at this station and not at one of the other stations. (Note: This worker cannot be cross-trained so they can only be assigned to one workstation; there will now be two people at the workstation instead of one. ) B. What will the maximum system capacity be if you assign the new employee to the workstation you indicated in the previous question and no other changes are made to the process? Assume that the new employee is just as fast as the current employee doing the same task.  Be sure to show calculations and/ or explain your answer).    Here is your response and earlier question:    The following is a process flow diagram of the steps involved in getting your car washed.  There is one worker assigned to each of the five tasks, for a total of 5 workers. Total task time at each of the five stations is provided. (Note: WIP = Work In Process Inventory; FG = Finished Goods; RM = Raw materials or customers).    Please answer the following 5 questions - label each response  A, B, C, D, and E, and include the term in your response to avoid mixing up the responses. A. What is the unconstrained capacity in terms of units per hour for each workstation?   Be sure to include units of measure for your answer (i.e. cars, seconds, cars/ hour, hours/ car, etc.)  and show the calculation used to determine these values.  (Note: Unconstrained capacity is how much can be produced per time period if it is not limited by production of an earlier workstation) Order and pay = Wash = Dry = Vacuum = Inspect = B. Which operation is the bottleneck operation?  Why? C. What is the maximum system capacity in terms of cars completely processed per hour? (Assume that the process has already completed the first unit.)  Explain your answer or show your calculations. D. What is the value of the minimum throughput time? (include units of measure)  Explain your answer or show your calculations. E. What is the value of the system cycle time?  (include units of measure)  Explain your answer or show your calculations.   Your Answer:  A. Order and Pay = 60 min/hr / 1 min/car = 60 car/hr.      Wash = 60 min/hr / 10 min/car  = 6 car/hr.      Dry = 60 min/hr / 12 min/car = 5 car/hr.       Vacuum = 60 min/hr / 2 min/car = 30 car/hr.      Inspect = 60 min/hr / 3min/car = 20 car/hr. B. The drying cars operation is the bottleneck operation because it has the lowest capacity. C. The maximum system capacity is the same capacity as our bottleneck, which is 5. D. 1 min/car + 10 min/car + 12 min/car + 2 min/car + 3 min/car = 28 min/car E. 12 min/car because the time completing one car to the next cannot be less than the bottleneck.
While validating a test, the test developer calculates correlations between his/her test, a test that measures the same construct, a test that measures an unrelated trait.  High correlations with the test that measures a similar trait is evidence of ____________ validity and low correlations with the test that measures an unrelated trait is evidence of ____________ validity.
Vitamin C, a fat-soluble vitamin, is necessary for the production of stomach acid.
Archaeologists used pieces of burned wood, or charcoal, found at the site to date prehistoric paintings and drawings on walls and ceilings of a cave in Lascaux, France. Use the carbon dating method to determine the appropriate age of a piece of burned wood, if it was found that 83.5% of the carbon isotope C-14 found in living trees of the same type had decayed. You will need to use the fact that the half-life of C-14 is approximately 5,730 years. (Round your answer to the nearest hundred years.)

A small hollow sphere of mass m=300 g is rolling without slippage along the hills as shown above. The speed of the center of mass of the sphere at point A is vA=3.00 m/s, hA=4.00 m, hB=2.00 m, and hC=1.00 m. The work done by non-conservative forces while the sphere rolls from point A to point C is negligible. Point C is at the bottom of a circular arc segment of radius R=10.0m. a) (3p) What is the total kinetic energy of the sphere at point A? Show work by typing in. b) (7p) What is the speed of the center of mass of the sphere at point C? Show work by typing in. c) (5p) What is the magnitude of the normal force exerted on the sphere at point C? Show work by typing in.

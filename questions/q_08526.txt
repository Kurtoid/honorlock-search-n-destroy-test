The _______ is the unpaid family work that leaves parents stressed and drained.
Randall Hightower was out hunting deep in the Colorado forest. He was sitting in a tree stand waiting for a white tailed deer to wander by so he could shoot it and feed his family. Near the end of the day, he was getting tired and ready to head back to the camp for dinner when he heard a noise of something big coming through the brush. He saw a flash of brown and a small white patch of hair. He raised his gun, steadied his breath, and pulled the trigger. The shot rang true and Hightower scampered down the tree to admire his kill. Unfortunately, he did not kill a deer but his best friend, Amy Andrews. Hightower panicked and ran back to camp leaving Amy's body in the woods. When Amy did not return for the evening the camp leader called the local sheriff to report a missing hunter. The sheriff came out to the camp and addressed the hunters to form a search party for Amy. At that point, Hightower stated that he had shot her. Hightower was arrested and taken to the police station. The sheriff remained behind to form the search party to head into the woods at first light. At the station Hightower was given Miranda warnings and he invoked both the right to remain silent and the right to counsel. No interrogation took place from that point forward. The next morning the search party headed out to look for Amy's body. At noon the search party had not found Amy's body. At that same time Hightower was transported by two deputy sheriffs to the courthouse for arraignment. On the walk from the jail to the courthouse the officers talked to each other about the fact that a winter storm was blowing in that evening and would probably prevent the search party from getting back into the woods for at least a week. Hightower spoke up and told the officers he would take them to Amy's body. The deputies took Hightower to the woods and he lead the sheriff directly to Amy's body. At Hightower's trial his statement that he would take them to the body should be:

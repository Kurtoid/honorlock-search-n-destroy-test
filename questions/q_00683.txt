You might consider such elements as structure, selection of detail, imagery, diction, tone, and/or relevant elements external to the poem. Your essay will be rewarded for its complexity of thought, clear focus, and specific details, as well as for its adherence to the conventions of standard written English. Choose one of the poems below:   "Sonnet 30" by Spenser   My love is like to ice, and I to fire: How comes it then that this her cold so great Is not dissolved through my so hot desire, But harder grows the more I her entreat? Or how comes it that my exceeding heat Is not allayed by her heart-frozen cold, But that I burn much more in boiling sweat, And feel my flames augmented manifold? What more miraculous thing may be told, That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice, And ice, which is congealed with senseless cold, Should kindle fire by wonderful device? Such is the power of love in gentle mind, That it can alter all the course of kind.   "This is a Poem to my Son Peter" by Peter Meinke This is a poem to my son Peter whom I have hurt a thousand time whose large and vulnerable eyes have glazed in pain at my ragings thin wrists and fingers hung boneless in despair, pale freckled back bent in defeat, pillow soaked by my failure to understand. I have scarred through weakness and impatience your frail confidence forever because when I needed to strike you were there to be hurt and because I thought you knew you were beautiful and fair your bright eyes and hair but now I see that no one knows that about himself, but must be told and retold until it takes hold because I think anything can be killed  after awhile, especially beauty so I write this for life, for love, for you, my oldest son Peter, age 10, going on 11.

QUESTION 3     Consider a certain planet with a radius double that of the earth and a mass six times that of the earth.  An astronaut with mass 82 kg lands on this planet. Take the mass of the earth as 6 x 1024 kg.      3.1   Determine the force of attraction the earth will exert on the astronaut, if he finds himself on the surface of the earth.    (3)     3.2   Calculate the radius of the earth.   (5)     3.3   Determine the force of attraction the other planet will exert on the astronaut.   (6)     3.4   Calculate the gravitational acceleration on the other planet.    (3)                           [17]

Read the lab description and answer questions 1-7 Jack was tasked with determining which brand of pen is most likely to attract a termite. He selected 5 brands of black ink pen, Bic, Precision V5, Sharpie, Papermate, Pilot, plus a pencil. Jack knows from previous experience that the termites are attracted to ink from a black Bic pen and are not attracted to lead from a pencil. To complete the experiment Jack drew a 7 cm diameter circle with each pen and placed a termite 0.25 cm from each circle. He then gave the termite 60 seconds to find the circle and travel around the circle. Jack defined positive results as a termite finding the circle within 60 seconds and then following the circle at least half way around. A negative result would be a termite that was unable to find the circle within 60 seconds or a termite that found the circle but followed it for less than half the circle. Jack tested ten termites on each brand of pen for a total of sixty termites. The results of Jack's experiment are found in the table below. Table 1: Number of termites that found the black 7 cm diameter circle within 60 seconds and then followed the circle for at least half the total distance.    Brand of pen Bic Precision V5 Sharpie Papermate Pilot Pencil   # of termites 10 2 0 4 10 2      What is Jack's hypothesis?

Which of the following is probably NOT a multiple-casualty incident?
Platelets, which have negatively-charged cell membranes, adhere to the positively charged surface of a torn blood vessel.  As they do so, they release substances which attract more platelets to the damaged area and change the charge on their cell membranes to positive.  More platelets adhere to the damaged area.  The cycle repeats until the damaged area is sealed.

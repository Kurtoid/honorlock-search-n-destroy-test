The manufacturer will choose unit A if is superior than unit B.  In a random sample of 85 automobile engine crankshaft bearings, 10 have a surface finish roughness that exceeds the specifications. Do these data present strong evidence that the proportion of crankshaft bearings exhibiting excess surface roughness exceeds 0.10? If the standard deviation of hole diameter exceeds 0.01 millimeters, there is an unacceptable high probability that the rivet will not fit. A sample of 15 diameters has a standard deviation of 0.008 millimeters. Is there strong evidence to indicate that the standard deviation of hole diameter exceeds 0.01 millimeter? An engineer who is studying the tensile strength of a steel alloy intended for use in gold club selected a random sample of 12 specimens with a mean tensile strength of 3,450 psi. Test the hypothesis that mean strength is 3500 psi.

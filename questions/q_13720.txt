Answer the following question based on the following scenarioYou are observing the kitchen as they prepare for lunch service. There are 2 employees preparing everything. Upon questioning, the cook tells you there are typically four staff in the kitchen. You observe the cook cutting raw meat on the counter top to put in the oven. As she is putting the prepared meat in the oven, the prep cook begins to cut up vegetables on the same counter top for the salad to be served in the dining room. The prep cook who is wearing gloves to cut up the vegetables then put the unusable portions of the vegetables in the garbage, knife in the sink, and then scoops the veggies for the salad into the serving bowl. The dining room is scheduled to start serving residents at 12:00. The cook puts food on the line at 11:00 and puts regular spoons in the pans for serving. As they begin the tray line you inquire about why the plate warmer is not turned on. The cook tells you it has been broke for a few weeks now. The menu for lunch service states "meatloaf, mashed potatoes/gravy, green beans, and cinnamon apples." On the plate you notice the green beans were left off. The staff states the patient does not like green beans. As you walk out into the dining room at 12:15, there is no staff in the dining room yet. As the trays come out at 12:30, nursing staff enters the dining room and starts serving the residents. Prior to serving the resident, a clothing protector is put on each resident to prevent spilling food on their clothes. As you walk around and talk to residents. They consistently tell the food tastes pretty good, but is not hot enough. After the trays are passed, cupcakes that a staff member prepared at home are given out to the residents for monthly birthdays'. 45.

Perform the following hypothesis test : Your statistics instructor claims that at least 60 percent of the students who take her Elementary Statistics class go through life feeling more enriched. For some reason that she can't quite figure out, most people don't believe her. You decide to check this out on your own. You randomly survey 64 of her past Elementary Statistics students and find that 34 feel more enriched as a result of her class. Now, what do you think? (You may assume that the underlying population is normally distributed.)   Is this a test of one mean or proportion? [a1] State the claim in mathematical form. [a2] (This is the [a16] hypothesis.) Identify the null and alternative hypothesis. H0: [a3] HA: [a4] We will use the [a5] distribution because this is a proportion. Is this a left, right, or two-tailed test? Pick the matching graph. [a15] A. B. C. State the significance level. a = [a8] Calculate the p-value using technology. p-value = [a7] Compare the p-value to the significance level. p-value [a9] a, meaning that we will [a10] the H0. Therefore, because we [a11] the H0  and the original claim was the [a12], we find that there [a13] sufficient evidence to [a14] of the claim that at least 60 percent of the students who take her Elementary Statistics class go through life feeling more enriched.

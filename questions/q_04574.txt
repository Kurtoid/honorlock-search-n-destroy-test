The next two questions (99-100) are related to this scenario:  Ecologist Joseph Connell conducted a long-term field experiment in which he first selected two similar inter-tidal areas. He found a very large rock in both areas in which two species of barnacles lived, species A (small barnacles) and species B (large barnacles). Species A tended to live higher on the rocks than species B, and you could observe the boundary where the two species met. In "Area 1" he scraped off all the small barnacles from the zone just above the boundary line where the two species met. In "Area 2" he scraped off all the large barnacles from the zone just below the boundary line where the two species met. In the first area he continuously kept the zone free of small barnacles. In the second area he continuously kept the zone free of large barnacles. (Hint: it might help you to draw out these scenarios.)

QUESTION 5         An escape lane is an emergency area placed next to a steep, downhill section of a road. It allows vehicles with brake failure to slow down and stop away from the other traffic. One type of escape lane uses a gravity ramp. These are built with an upwards gradient to slow the vehicle.    Right click on the button to open the photograph of a gravity ramp in a new window.         5.1   Explain how using the ramp enables a vehicle to stop.   (2)         An escape lane consists of a ramp at an angle of 10deg to the horizontal and is 180 m in length. A lorry of mass 2.8 x 103 kg enters the escape lane due to brake failure.   Right click on the button to open a diagram of the ramp in a new window.           5.2   Show that the component of the weight of the lorry parallel to the ramp is about 5 x 103 N.

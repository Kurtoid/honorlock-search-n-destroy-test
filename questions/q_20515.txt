A mouse tale   While breeding mice for an experiment, researchers mated a male with a bent tail to a female with a normal tail. The phenotypes of their offspring (the F1 generation) differed between males and females. All female offspring had bent tails, whereas all male offspring had normal tails. The researchers concluded that the gene for tail shape lies on one of the sex chromosomes.  Figure 1. A cross between two mice (F1 generation) produced a 50:50 ratio of offspring (F2 generation).   Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 26-30.       26. The gene for a bent tail vs a normal tail is likely located on the X chromosome.

Steven is a 6 year old boy with retinoblastoma.  You intend to determine whether his cancer was caused by a mutation in the Retinoblastoma (Rb) gene. An AaT single base pair substitution is frequently associated with this type of cancer.  You use Allele-Specific Oligonucleotides (ASOs) to determine the Rb genotype.  You test the following tissues:  Steven's tumor Steven's cheek epithelial cells Epithelial cells from Susan, Steven's older sister. Susan does NOT have cancer.  The ASO hybridization results are shown below.     A) is Rb an oncogene or a tumor suppressor?     B) Based on your answer in part A, what is the normal function of Rb: to promote cell division, or inhibit cell division?     C) How many alleles of Rb need to be mutated in order for cancer to develop?     D) Which numbered ASO result most likely corresponds with which sample? Explain your answer.

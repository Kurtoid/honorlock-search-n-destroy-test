You have performed multiple linear regression to determine predicted values of a plasma bioassay for high ethanol intake (using a CDT, carbohydrate-deficient transferrin assay) in a large group (1000) of cooperative males of various ages.  These men have been trained to confidentially and accurately report their "actual ethanol intake" per day over a period of 6 weeks. You measure their body fat, race, their estimate of weekly ethanol intake, age and serum CDT levels. You determine that all of these variables are statistically important except "race." What would be the ideal form you would use to express the predicted values for this variable?    1"Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin, known as "%CDT," is a blood test to detect heavy alcohol use (five or more drinks a day) over the past two weeks. This alcohol biomarker can provide clinicians with an objective way to screen and monitor clients in treatment for alcohol use disorders." (Wikipedia)

Madison Construction produces two products, steel beams and wood beams.  Management desires that its product mix of beams maximize weekly total contribution margin.  Direct labor is limited to 2,500 hours per week and machine hours are limited to 1,000 hours per week.  The maximum demand for steel beams is 95 beams per week; while the maximum demand for wood beams is 100 beams per week.  Other data for the beams appear below.   Additionally, total weekly beam production cannot exceed 175 beams due to storage constraints.     Steel Beams Wood Beams   Contribution margin per beam $220 $150   Direct labor hours per  beam 130 170   Machine hours per beam 80 120    Below is a partially completed linear program model that seeks to optimize (i.e., maximizes weekly total contribution margin) the product mix of steel and wood beams.  Fill in the blanks in the partially completed model using variables S, W and TCM which are defined as follows as well as the data provided above.  Please note: you are not being asked to solve the model, only to fill in the blanks to properly state the model.  S = number/quantity of steel beams and  W = number/quantity of wood beams and TCM = total contribution margin  The objective function is TCM = $[variable1]S + $[variable2]W  The constraints are:  Direct labor constraint is: [variable3]S + [variable4]W

(Oung Depression/Anxiety/Sleep Disorders) TZ is a 37 yoM who presents to clinic as a new patient, here to establish care. He reports being on tranylcypromine "on and off" for the last 2 years, but has been taking it consistently for the last 3 months. Despite this, he states his mood has been worsening rapidly. He denies having tried any other medication for his depression in the past. You have him fill out a PHQ-9, which reveals a score of 22. He denies any psychotic symptoms at this time. His provider would like to switch TZ from tranylcypromine to paroxetine and would like to know how to switch him from his current medication. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation regarding this switch?

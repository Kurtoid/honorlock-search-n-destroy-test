Fugate Company had 1,500,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2020. On July 1, 2021 an additional 1,250,000 shares were issued for cash. Fugate also had stock options outstanding at the beginning and end of 2021 which allow the holders to purchase 375,000 shares of common stock at $20 per share. The average market price of Fugate's common stock was $25 during 2021. What is the number of shares that should be used in computing diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2021?
Mr. Johnson was admitted to the ICU due to hypertension.  He has recently developed respiratory distress due to angioedema.  What do you suspect is the cause of the swollen tongue?
Dr. Rodriguez describes the experiment to a friend. The friend mentions that there might be a problem with the study, since some of the families might already have a pet dog that isn't a service dog. These dogs could provide some of the same benefits as service dogs. Could the fact that some families already own a dog threaten the internal validity of Dr. Rodriguez's experiment?
The structures in the oral region that are closest to the tongue are called:
[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).] The two toy boxcars shown below collide with one another and bounce off of each other in a collision that lasts 0.088 s.  The mass of boxcar 1 is 3.00 kg and the mass of boxcar 2 is 5.00 kg.  Prior to the collision, boxcar 1 is moving to the right at 3.00 m/s.  After the collision, boxcar 1 is moving to the left at 3.33 m/s and boxcar 2 is moving to the right at 1.11 m/s.      a) Draw a diagram of the final state and determine the initial velocity of boxcar 2.  [you will scan and submit this after the quiz] b) Briefly describe how you could determine, numerically, whether the above collision was elastic or inelastic. [enter your description below] c) Determine the impulse caused by Boxcar 2 pushing on Boxcar 1.  [enter the numerical answer below; submit work after quiz] d) Using impulse/momentum principles, determine the magnitude and direction of the force that is exerted on Boxcar 1 by Boxcar 2.  [enter the numerical answer below; submit work after quiz] You will scan your work for parts a, c, and d of this problem and submit it immediately following the quiz.

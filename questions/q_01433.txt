You will have an opportunity to earn these extra credit points on the day of your Kaplan proctored exam day.  You will receive 1 point for having the highlighted information drawn correctly: frequency, duration. baseline fetal heart rate, variability and variable. There are 5 potential points. Label each item on your sheet. On your paper, draw 3 contractions that are 3 minutes in frequency. (1/2 point) Make the durations for each contraction:  first contraction last 30 seconds, the second contraction last 90 seconds, and the third contraction 40 seconds Give the fetus a baseline heart rate of 140 with moderate variability. With the first contraction draw an acceleration and with the second contraction draw an early deceleration.   All of this will fit on one side of your paper. Label the side you want me to grade.

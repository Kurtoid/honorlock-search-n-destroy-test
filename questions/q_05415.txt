For (a) and (b), determine the maximum amount of ATP that can be generated from the following scenarios based upon both substrate-level phosphorylation AND oxidative phosphorylation (probably a good idea to note accounting and not just include a single number).  Then answer (c). (a) The oxidation of the amino acid alanine to produce 3 molecules of CO2; (b) conversion of a molecule of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and two 6 carbon fatty acids to 7 molecules of acetyl-CoA under conditions where the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase shuttle is operating (c) In some tissue types (like brown adipose tissue; BAT), an alternative NADH oxidase can be produced that directly couples NADH oxidation to reduction of oxygen, and all the energy is released as heat. In BAT, the levels and rates of alternative NADH oxidase and complex I of electron transport chain (ETC) present result in a ratio of NADH oxidation of 4 NADH by complex I for every 1 NADH oxidized by alternative NADH oxidase.  What is the maximum ATP that can be generated by 1 molecule of glucose using ONLY oxidative phosphorylation and the malate-aspartate shuttle?

Calcium is an essential nutrient for strong bones and for controlling blood pressure and heart beat. Because most of the body's calcium is stored in bones and teeth, the body withdraws the calcium it needs from the bones. Over time, if more calcium is taken out of the bones than is put in, the result may be thin, weak bones. This is especially important for women who are often recommended a calcium supplement. A consumer group activist assumes that calcium content in two popular supplements are normally distributed with the same unknown population variance, and uses the following information obtained under independent sampling:    Supplement 1 Supplement 2     1 = 1,000 mg   2 = 1,016 mg    s1 = 23 mg  s2  = 24 mg    n1  = 12  n2 = 15    Let m1 and m2 denote the corresponding population means. Can we conclude that the average calcium content of the two supplements differs at the 95% confidence level?

Read the lab description and answer questions 1-7 Jack was tasked with determining which brand of pen is most likely to attract a termite. He selected 5 brands of black ink pen, Bic, Precision V5, Sharpie, Papermate, Pilot, plus a pencil. Jack knows from previous experience that the termites are attracted to ink from a black Bic pen and are not attracted to lead from a pencil. To complete the experiment Jack drew a 7 cm diameter circle with each pen and placed a termite 0.25 cm from each circle. He then gave the termite 60 seconds to find the circle and travel around the circle. Jack defined positive results as a termite finding the circle within 60 seconds and then following the circle at least half way around. A negative result would be a termite that was unable to find the circle within 60 seconds or a termite that found the circle but followed it for less than half the circle. Jack tested ten termites on each brand of pen for a total of sixty termites. The results of Jack's experiment are found in the table below. Table 1: Number of termites that found the black 7 cm diameter circle within 60 seconds and then followed the circle for at least half the total distance.    Brand of pen Bic Precision V5 Sharpie Papermate Pilot Pencil   # of termites 10 2 0 4 10 2      What are Jack's standardized variables?

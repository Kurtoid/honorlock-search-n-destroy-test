(8 points) There is an endocrine disorder we did not get a chance to discuss called central diabetes insipidus, in which the pituitary gland does not make sufficient ADH (anti-diuretic hormone), leading to abnormally high amounts of urination.  The condition is treated using desmopressin (Minirin), a synthetic version of human ADH hormone.     Desmopressin is available as a nasal spray taken once daily.  It is not significantly metabolized.   Please answer both question A and B in the space provided (there is more than enough room)   A. (3 points) If a patient were to take this as an IV dose once daily, would the IV dose be much larger, much smaller, or about the same amount as the nasal spray dose?   B. (5 points) A potential side effect of desmopressin is hyponatremia (very low blood sodium levels).  Patients with very low plasma sodium levels are at high risk of brain seizures.  Explain the pathophysiologic mechanism by which hyponatremia lowers the threshold for a seizure in the brain.

Section 4: Low Income Housing Tax Credits Consider an affordable housing development, in which [a]% of units are provided for households at/below 60% of County Median Income (CMI), and another [b]% - for households at/below 50% CMI. The remaining units are market rent units.      [6 points] Does the development pass the 20/50 or 40/60 tests to qualify for the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs)? Is there another test that the development can use to qualify? If yes, explain what is the test and whether the development satisfies it. [6 points] The 20/50 and 40/60 tests are minimal requirements to receive the LIHTCs. In reality, the programs are highly competitive, especially 9% tax credits. (Note: Due to competition, the developments, that receive awards, set-aside higher fractions of the project for the LIHTC. Typically, at least 50% of units are set aside for households at/below 50% of CMI among which around 20% of units for households at/below 30% of CMI to have a high chance of receiving 9% tax credit award. Does the project satisfy this requirement to have a high chance of receiving 9% tax credits? If yes, assume that you are applying for 9% LIHTCs. If no, assume that you are applying for 4% LIHTCs.) [3 points] What is the tax credit rate for this project? [6 points] What is the applicable fraction? [6 points] Assume that the land acquisition cost is $[c], the hard costs of the project (construction costs of residential and common areas) are $[d]. The soft costs are [e]% of the hard costs. For simplicity, assume that there are no other components of the project costs, including the developer's or loan fees, that can impact the eligible basis. What is the eligible basis based on this information [6 points] Calculate the Annual Tax Credit Award. [3 points] What is the current price of the federal tax credits? [3 points] How many years is the Annual Tax Credit Award received for the federal tax credits? For how long does the development have to stay affordable if has won the award (account for both the Internal Revenue Service and Wisconsin State requirements)? [6 points] What is the maximum Investor Equity that the developer can get by selling all tax credits?            Please do not answer this question using the blank below.

MacConkey agar is a selective and differential medium used for the isolation of gram negative bacilli and the differentiation of lactose fermenters and non-lactose fermenters. The selective ingredients, crystal violet and bile salts, inhibit most bacteria other than gram negative bacilli. The differential ingredients are lactose and neutral red (which indicates the acidity of the culture). A lactose fermenter will produce acid and its colonies will be a shade of pink to purple. A non-lactose fermenter will not produce acid, and its colonies will be colorless.  What is the role of neutral red in MacConkey agar?

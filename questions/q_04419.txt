1.   Some students investigated the effect of temperature on the activity of amylase. Amylase is an enzyme that catalyses the break -down of starch. Starch changes the colour of iodine solution from orange-brown to blue-black. Step 1 The students added 2 cm3 of starch solution to a test tube, labelled it W, and placed it into a beaker of warm water. Step 2 They added 2 cm3 of starch solution to a second test tube, labelled it C, and placed it into a beaker of iced water. Step 3 The students placed one dropping pipette into each of the test tubes W and C. Step 4 They waited five minutes before continuing. Step 5 The students added 10 drops of amylase solution to each of test tubes W and C and shook both test tubes gently. Step 6 They started a timer. Step 7 The students immediately tested the liquids in test tubes W and C for starch using iodine solution. Step 8 The students repeated step 7 after 2, 4, 6 and 8 minutes.

You can use MATLAB either through UF Apps or if you have student license downloaded version of it. Here is the link for UF Apps: https://info.apps.ufl.edu A block is defined as a square of side length 100 pixels. Each block has an interior black border 5 pixels thick, rest of the block is yellow (RGB = [255 255 0].  Given the number of blocks (n) in the base of a pyramid, write a program that displays a pyramid with n base blocks that is also n blocks high as shows in the test cases below. Your image output should have a black background. (Note that blocks are present next to each other without any distance in between and every block has an interior 5 pixels thick black border).  n = input('Enter the number of base blocks n: '); In case the images do not show up in the following test cases, download this pdf: LINK Test Case 1: Enter the number of base blocks n: 1  Test Case 2: Enter the number of base blocks n: 2  Test Case 3: Enter the number of base blocks n: 3  Test Case 4: Enter the number of base blocks n: 5  Test Case 5:  Enter the number of base blocks n: 10

If a baseball player has a batting average of .325 (note that this average is the probability he will get a hit), what is the probability that he will get exactly 9 hits in his next 17 at bats? Round to 3 decimal places.
Based on all of the information provided in this question, complete the following "C" function, dma_init, by selecting the appropriate choice in each of the given dropdown boxes. The response chosen for some dropdown box is meant to replace the "" statement that immediately precedes this box. (NOTE: If you can't see an entire possible answer, zoom out. You can zoom out with Ctrl-minus, i.e., press the Ctrl key and the "-" key at the same time. Ctrl-plus can be used to zoom in.) ----------------------------------------------------- In this problem, the DMA system will be used to reverse the order of characters within a string (aka an array of characters). This task can be easily done using software, but requires the CPU to be held up completing this task. Using DMA for this task instead would allow the CPU to work on other tasks while DMA is reversing the string.  Assume the following parameters:   The string to be reversed is 100 characters long and is stored in data memory at addresses 0x2000 - 0x2063.  The reversed copy of the string should be stored at addresses 0x3000 - 0x3063.  The data should be copied using a block transfer, using the largest burst length possible for the given string size.  Software will manually trigger a transfer whenever it needs to reverse the string.

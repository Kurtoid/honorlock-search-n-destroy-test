It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,                      Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:                      The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms                      Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd                          their possets,                      That death and nature do contend about them,                      Whether they live or die.            MACBETH: [Within] Who's there? what, ho!      LADY MACBETH: Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,                   10                      And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed                      Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;                      He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled                      My father as he slept, I had done't.                      {Enter MACBETH.}                                                        My husband!              MACBETH: I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?      LADY MACBETH: I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.                      Did not you speak?            MACBETH:                   When?      LADY MACBETH:                       Now.          MACBETH:                         As I descended?      LADY MACBETH: Ay.            MACBETH: Hark!                      Who lies i' the second chamber?      LADY MACBETH:                               Donalbain.               20           MACBETH: This is a sorry sight.                      [Looking on his hands.]        LADY MACBETH: A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.            MACBETH: There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried                          'Murder!'                     That they did wake each other: I stood and heard                          them:                      But they did say their prayers, and address'd them                      Again to sleep.

Fishy proteins Cod fish have two alleles for a protein that binds oxygen, called the Hb-1 and Hb-2 alleles. Fish expressing the Hb-1 allele are found in different environments than fish expressing the Hb-2 allele. Upon bringing both groups of fish into a lab, scientists found that the Hb-1 and Hb-2 proteins function differently when tested under two different temperature treatments, cold and warm temperature. The groups of fish were similar in size, age, and sex ratios. The figure below shows the findings from the scientist's research.  Figure 1.  The oxygen-binding performance of a protein depends on which allele codes for the protein (Hb-1 or Hb-2). The x-axis indicates the temperatures at which the protein was tested. The y-axis indicates the amount of oxygen bound to either the Hb-1 or Hb-2 protein.     Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 16-20.   16.  In cold water, natural selection would favor heterozygotes that expressed Hb-1 and Hb-2 at the same time.

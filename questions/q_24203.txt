Krystal had a massive party.  She didn't mean to however it just got out of hand.  She had 35 people in her one bedroom apartment.  Fortunately, it was good natured fun and nothing was damaged nor was anyone hurt.  However, it was loud!  Singing, dancing, loud talking, clinking glasses and hoots and hollering abounded.  The party disturbed many neighbours who complained to the landlord.  On October 1, Krystal received the first N5 that she has ever gotten under her door.  She was mortified, very apologetic, and quiet as can be since then (so quiet that the landlord worried that she might have moved out!).  One of Krystal's neighbours told her that he missed an important second interview for a job he needed to get because of her party.  He is very angry at Krystal and refuses to accept her apology.  He has told the landlord that he will sue the landlord if he doesn't evict Krystal because he has lost something that he can never get back.  When can James (the landlord) apply to the LTB to evict Krystal?

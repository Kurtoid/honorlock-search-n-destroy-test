You decide to put your favorite houseplant in a room with only a green light (a bulb that is green, so that all the light coming out of it is green) for a month. You continue to water your plant, but do not apply any fertilizer or additional nutrients to the soil.  At the end of the month the plant is dead.  Why?
You recently discover a new type of active transport protein. After carrying out several biochemical assays, you determine that the protein is not inhibited by vanadate (an ion that would inhibit the phosphorylation of the protein). Additionally, you find that this active transport protein is present in lysosomes and endosomes and that it transports protons using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Based on this evidence, what can you conclude about this newly discovered active transporter?

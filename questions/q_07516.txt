You can assume that the free cash flow at t = 4 = $123.60 million.  In other words, you don't need to worry about the complications that we discussed regarding the calculation of continuing value. -Since we are assuming that the cash flows are paid at the end of the year, there is no reason to employ a mid-year adjustment. The analyst has also collected some additional information about Clark Company: -The company's WACC = 10%. -Once again:  All cash flows are received and paid at the end of the year, so there is no need for you to do a mid-year adjustment. -The company's non-operating asset consists of excess cash, which totals $300 million. -The market value of debt equals $498.5832 million. -The company has 10 million shares of common stock outstanding.

A survey will be given to 500 students randomly selected from the freshmen class at UW-Madison.  The population is:
a) Your company is designing a metal-on-metal hip implant (i.e. where both the femoral head and the acetabular cup are metal components). Which of these two forms of corrosion is of more concern: fretting corrosion or crevice corrosion? Why? (1 point) b) Upon in vivo testing in a sheep model, it was found that corrosion lead to large (> 7 um) metallic particles being released from the implant. Which cell type(s) involved in the innate immune response likely responded to these particles and how did they likely respond? (1 point) c) You wish to test the in vitro cytotoxicity of these metallic particles on bone-forming osteoblast cells. Briefly describe an assay (or series of assays) you could use to determine the number of viable and nonviable osteoblasts after 48 hours of in vitro incubation with these particles. (2 points) d) What part of the acquired immune response is of long-term concern if this metallic implant is used? What type of immune system cell is involved in this response? (1 point)

A sample of hydrogen gas exerts a pressure of 466 torr in a container. What is this pressure in atmospheres? (1 atm = 1.01325 x105 Pa = 760 torr)
A recent survey showed that in a sample of 100 elementary school teachers, 15 were single. In a sample of 180 high school teachers, 36 were single. Is the proportion of elementary school teachers who were single less than the proportion of high school teachers who were single? Use a = 0.01.   H0:  [response0]  Ha: [response1] Test statistic: [response2] p-Value = [response3] Decision: [response4] Conclusion: There [response5] sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the proportion of single elementary teachers is less than that of high school teachers.

Remember:  Save your file often in case of a Simio crash. Keep track of time.  You must upload your Simio file before time runs out. Problem Description Parts arrive according to a Poisson process with a mean rate of 10 per hour between 6AM and noon each day and no arrivals occur after noon until the next day at 6AM.  As parts arrive, they are placed (instantaneously) in a temporary warehouse.  Each hour, at the top of the hour, starting at 7AM each day, all parts from the temporary warehouse are removed and sent to Department 501 for processing.  Dept. 501 consists of one workstation called WS A.  Travel time from the temporary warehouse to WS A is uniformly distributed between 4 and 8 minutes, and travel time from WS A to exiting the Dept. 501 (and thus leaving the system) is also uniformly distributed between 4 and 8 minutes.  As soon as the part reaches WS A, it is in Dept. 501.   WS A consists of a single-server machine.  The processing time on the machine is exponentially distributed with mean 7.5 minutes.  Each completed part yields a revenue of $20 and each hour that a part spends in Department 501 cost $1.25.  (There is no cost associated with time spent in the temporary warehouse.)  In addition, there is a cost of $200 per hour of overtime.  (Both costs are linear; for example, 30 minutes of overtime would cost $100.) All workers are full time workers which means that Dept. 501 must stay open for at least 8 hours.  After the 8-hour day is finished, the workers must stay until all parts that will arrive for the day have exited the department, and if workers must stay longer than 8 hours, that time is considered overtime.  Simulate this system and define two responses that answer the following questions:  (1) What is the average daily profit of the system?  (2) What is the average daily overtime in minutes that workers should expect for this system?  Base your answers on 50 days of data with one replication being a single day. To verify that you can interpret your responses, give the average profit per day rounded to the nearest dollar and give the average time of day at which the workers can go home rounded to the nearest minute within a Floor Label.  Write your answer for time of day in the following format hh:mm AM or hh:mm PM, i.e., use a 12-hour clock and explicitly write either AM or PM. In addition to the Floor Label, have two Status Labels in your model that show dynamically (1) the number of entities in the temporary warehouse and (2) the number of entities in Dept. 501.  Note that as entities travel from the temporary warehouse to Department 501, they are neither in the warehouse nor in Dept. 501; however, entities traveling from WS A to the exit are considered within Dept 501. When viewing your model, entities should be visible and colored as follows:  (1) green within the temporary warehouse, (2) blue while traveling from the warehouse to Department 501, while in the input buffer to WS A, and while traveling from WS A to the exit, and (3) red while being processed in WS A.   All assignment statements and tallies must be done through Processes. If this requirement is ignored, it will cost 10 points.

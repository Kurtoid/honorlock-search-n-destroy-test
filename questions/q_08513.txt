Write a function named PercentEven that accepts an array of integers as a parameter and returns the percentage of the values contained in the array that are even. For example, in the array {14, 17, 2, 6, 9}, there are 3 even numbers (14, 2 and 6) so you can calculate the percentage of even numbers as follows: 3 / 5 * 100. The 5 represents the total number of numbers in the array. If the array is empty the percentage is 0. You should not modify the contents of the array. You may not make any assumptions about the values stored in the array.

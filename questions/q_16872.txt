Steroids molecules, many of which are hormones, are comprised of three six-membered rings and a five-membered ring fused together. The four rings were assigned specific letter designations (A-D, shown below). In most steroids, the ring junctions are all trans (as illustrated below), so ring flipping does not occur. Consider the structure of fluticasone furoate, the active ingredient in Flonase Sensimist nasal spray (shown below). Given that the B/C and C/D junctions are trans and that all substituents at these junctions are axial, what are the orientations (axial or equatorial) of the indicated ring substituents?  Indicated F atom: [Fatom] axial, equatorial Indicated OH group: [OHgroup] axial, equatorial

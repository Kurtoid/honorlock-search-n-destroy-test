(Hornecker Dyslipidemia) A 60 year-old African-American woman has asked whether she should be taking a statin to reduce her risk of stroke, but is worried about the statin causing diabetes. Her mother had diabetes and had a stroke at age 59. She is a nonsmoker. Blood pressure is 142/88 mm Hg on two antihypertensive medications, and her BMI is 31. She has a rheumatoid arthritis for which she takes methotrexate.  She also has chronic kidney disease, but her SCr has been stable at 1.4 mg/dL for the last year.  Her fasting lipid panel reveals a total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL, HDL-C 55 mg/dL, triglycerides 100 mg/dL, and LDL-C 125 mg/dL. Her fasting blood sugar is 109 mm/dL and hemoglobin A1c is 5.9%. According to the Pooled Cohort Equation for African-American women, her estimated 10-year ASCVD risk is 8.7%.   Which of the following is the best recommendation at this time?
Given the series of reactions with known changes of enthalpy: A + [c1]B - [c2]C +[c3]D                DH1 = [dh1] kJ/mol             B - G                                   DH2 = [dh2] kJ/mol             A - [c3]D + E                      DH3 = [dh3] kJ/mol   Figure out change of enthalpy (DH) of the reaction: [c1]G + E - [c2]C Write your answer in kJ/mol rounding up to 0 decimal places.

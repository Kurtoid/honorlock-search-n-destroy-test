The graph below shows the wavelengths at which different photoreceptors absorb in two species: a) the common shovelnose ray (a guitarfish) and b) the blacktip shark.  It shows the absorbance for rods (504 nm) and 3 types of cones (477, 502, and 561 nm) for the common shovelnose ray (the wavelength for the rods and the 502 nm cones overlap, which is why the curve looks green/black). It shows the absorbance for rods (506 nm) and 1 type of cone (532 nm) in the blacktip shark. Explain the significance of these findings and describe differences between vision in these 2 species.

The base of a right triangle is measured to be 3 cm and the height of the triangle is measured to be 4 cm.  The base measurement has a maximum error of 0.05 cm and the height has a maximum error of 0.02 cm.  Use differentials to approximate the maximum possible error in calculating the area of the triangle.   Show all work on your paper. Place your final answer below.

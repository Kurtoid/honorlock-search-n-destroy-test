There is one class of anti-cancer drug that is fairly effective at slowing tumor growth.  But, one of its side effects is that it kills cells that have CD4 molecules.  Suppose that someone who has been treated with this anti-cancer drug for several months.  He is then given a tuberculosis skin test.  If he was exposed to tuberculosis before (several years ago), would you expect this tuberculosis skin test to give a positive result?  Why or why not?  To receive full credit, you must (1) demonstrate that you know how the tuberculosis skin test (i.e. Type IV hypersensitivity) works, and (2) you can relate that to the scenario described here.

You are exhibiting at a national show at which 5/8ths of the attendees tend to visit a majority of the booths.  Opening at 8 am daily, and closing at 6:30 pm, the shows runs Monday through Friday.  Roughly 5,000 people will attend the show, of which 2,500 are in your target market (each of whom will visit your booth).  Your booth staff will average 5 minutes speaking with each contact.  You will need an additional 125 square feet for demonstration space, private places, etc.  A total of 150 new sales will be made as a direct result of the qualified sales leads generated by the show.  You may assume that your attraction and contact efficiencies are equal, and that all industry and product types averages apply.  Round up to the nearest square foot.     Your formula for minimum booth size is: (Attendance * Product Interest % * A.I.F. * 50) / (Show Hours * Salesperson Rate)   IF the firm had NOT exhibited at the trade show, how many sales calls would have been necessary to generate the same number of new sales?

A woman purchased a vineyard, financing a large part of the purchase price by a loan from an investor that was secured by a mortgage on the land. The mortgage agreement with the investor included an acceleration clause and further provided that a defaulting borrower waives her right to redeem once foreclosure proceedings have begun. The investor properly recorded his mortgage. Three years later, the woman needed additional money to upgrade her harvesting equipment. She obtained a loan from a friend, also secured by a mortgage on the land. The friend properly recorded her mortgage. The next year, there was an unusually dry season in the region and the vineyard yielded a poor harvest. The woman failed to make payments to either the investor or the friend. The balance on the loan from the investor was $100,000, and the balance on the loan from the friend was $15,000. The investor instituted foreclosure proceedings in a jurisdiction that provides a statutory right of redemption. The day before the judicial sale, the woman won a $60,000 prize in a wine competition. She quickly contacted the investor and offered to pay off both loans in full. Because the win at the competition had greatly increased the value of the property, the investor refused the woman's offer. The investor was hoping to buy the property at the judicial sale. If the woman seeks to force the investor to accept her offer, will she likely prevail?

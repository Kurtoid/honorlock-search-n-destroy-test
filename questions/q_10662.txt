On September 1, the owner of a historic home that had been converted into a bed and breakfast mailed a letter to the granddaughter of the original builder of the home who had expressed an interest in buying the home and business. In this letter, the owner offered to sell the home to the granddaughter for $500,000. The offer expressly stated that the offer expires on November 1, "if your acceptance has not been received by me on or before that date." On the morning of November 1, the granddaughter sent a written acceptance to the owner by messenger. However, through negligence of the messenger, the acceptance was not delivered to the owner until November 2.

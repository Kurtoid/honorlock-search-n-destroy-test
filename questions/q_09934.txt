In a response of 150-200 words (about 10-12 sentences/1 solid paragraph) provide an overview of Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper." Discuss the "outline" and "setting" of the story. Where does the story take place and what is the "expressed purpose" for the narrator's visit to this "place." Identify SPECIFIC items of the setting that suggest "confinement." Who is it that "inflicts" this confinement on the narrator and what is the reason given for this "confinement"? Also, throughout the story are numerous "symbols" that suggest "confinement." Identify at least TWO (or more) of these "symbols" and discuss how they symbolize the narrator's "confined" position in the story.

A woodland can support a combination of wrens (species 1) and warblers (species 2) competing for the same resources.  Suppose that, upon investigation, we find that there are enough resources for 1600 wrens if there were no warblers.  Conversely, suppose that we know that the resources could support 1000 warblers if there were no wrens.  Suppose also that 4 warblers have the same competitive effect on wrens that one wren has upon other wrens.  Finally assume that 5 wrens have the same competitive effect on warblers that one warbler has upon other warblers.  Again, species 1 is wrens, 2 is warblers. What is the coefficient of competition for the effect of warblers on wren?

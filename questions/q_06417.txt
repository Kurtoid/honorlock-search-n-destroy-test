Provide an appropriate response.The following frequency distribution analyzes the scores on a math test. Find the class midpoint of scores interval 95-99.
You work at a steel mill designing their carburization process.  During carburization, steel is exposed to methane gas at high temperatures.  The carbon from the methane diffuses into the surface of the steel forming a "carburized" near-surface layer that is significantly harder than the original steel. At the carburization temperature of 600 degC, the diffusivity of carbon in steel is about 1 (microns)2/s.  If you are asked to diffuse the carbon 10 microns into the steel (i.e., form a 10 micron thick carburized layer), approximately how long should you expose the steel to this carburization process?

Answer the following questions:. Submit everything on-line. (a) For a fault that can be dropped using global equivalent fault analysis, but is not dropped by using the labeling technique, which of the following process can find it easily to avoid unnecessary ATPG process: (a) test pattern generation, (b) fault simulation, (c) controllability/observability analysis, (d) design for testability. (b) Check point faults cannot be used to generate a fault list because some faults are dropped using (      ) relationship.  (c) Give two conditions under which D-algorithm will insert one node into its decision tree.    (d) Assume PODEM is used to generate a test pattern with the decision tree shown in Figure 5. Identify the backtracking where the logic value assigned to an input must be erased? (e) At lease how many iterations of fault simulations must be done using a 32-bit computer for a circuit with 1000,000 faults? You can just give the equation. (f) Which fault simulation method uses set operations, and which one uses the concept of good gate and bad gate simulations? (g) To perform timing verification of a scan chain for shift operation, the R and C values of each metal line used to connect two scan cells must be extracted from the VLSI layout to guarantee the correct functional and timing operations of the scan operations. Which test pattern must be used for static timing analysis?    (h) In Figure 6, if line L1 has a single stuck-at 0 fault, what problem will occur? If line L1 has a single stuck-at 1 fault, what problem will occur?

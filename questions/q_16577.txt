Consider the estimated equation from your textbook = 698.9  -  2.28 STR,     R2 = 0.051, SER = 18.6             The standard error for the intercept estimate is 10.4 and the standard error for the slope coefficient estimate is 0.52. Use this information to calculate the t-statistic for the slope. Round your answer to two decimal places:

Five springs, having stiffnesses k1 = 105 N/m, k2 = 2 x 105 N/m, k3 = 3 x 105 N/m, k4 = 4 x 105 N/m, and k5 = 5 x 105 N/m, are connected as a parallel-series system and are subjected to a load P = 1000 N at node 5.         Write the stiffness matrices for each of the elements (5 points) Using the assembly of elements, formulate the stiffness matrix of the structure WITHOUT CONSTRAINTS. (10 points) Write the stiffness matrix of the CONSTRAINED structure with the boundary conditions applied as indicated in the figure. (5 points) Determine the displacements of nodes 2, 3, and 4 using the finite element method. State the assumptions made in your solution (5 points)

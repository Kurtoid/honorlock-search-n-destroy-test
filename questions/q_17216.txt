Farmer Jones has been growing a prize-winning, blue pansies for several years. He is always careful never to let any other pansies breed with his blue pansies.  He forgot to bring in his true-breeding pansies during the flowering season last year. The offspring this year produced all blue flowers (F1 generation). Jones was lucky and he ended up with another set of offspring (F2 generation) at the end of the year. However, these pansies had some white flowers among a large proportion of blue.  Not very happy that his prize-winning blue pansies are showing a different color, Farmer Jones storms down the street. As he does, he passes his neighbor, Drew Berry and notices that she has pansies that are all white. He also remembers that she has always had white pansies in her front lawn, and that each year she brings them in during flowering. She had not done so last year! The alleles for flower color are R and r. Use this scenario to answer questions A - E.  A. The phenotype of the dominant flower color is [A] B. The genotype of the white flowered plant is [B] C. The genotype of the F1 generation of blue flowers is [C] D. If farmer Jones wanted to know the genotype of his blue F1 generation flowers, he would carry out a [D]  E. [E] proportion of Drew Berry's flowers that are expected to be white.

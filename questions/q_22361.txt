A garden center wants to store leftover packets of vegetable seeds for sale the following spring, but the center is concerned that the seeds may not germinate at the same rate a year later.  The manager finds a packet of last year's green bean seeds and plants them as a test.  Although the packet claims a germination rate of 92%, only 172 of 200 test seeds sprout.  Is this evidence that the seeds have lost viability during a year in storage? Test the claim that the germination rate after being stored for a year is less than 92%.  Use a significance level of 0.05.   Show all steps and all appropriate work.      (You don't have to use any "fancy"  symbols when showing your work.  Improvise as needed.   ;-))

You run logistic regression on a dataset for Churn prediction called "Churn", where the column"y" contains the dependent variable.  You designate 50% of the items as training items (with indices in a variable called training) and 50% of the data as test items.  You create a linear discriminant analysis model called lda.Churn on the training data using the lda function.  What code should you use to get predictions using lda.Churn and the remaining test data?

A population of 1,000 birds exists on a small Pacific island.  Some of the birds are yellow, a characteristic determined by a recessive allele.  The others are green, a characteristic determined by a dominant allele.  A hurrican on the island kills most of the birds from the whole population.  Only ten remain, and those birds all have yellow feathers.  This situation illustrates ______________________.

The heat of combustion per mole for acetylene, C2H2(g), is -1299.5 kJ/mol. Assuming that the combustion products are CO2(g) and H2O(l), and given that the enthalpy of formation is -393.5 kJ/mol for CO2(g) and -285.8 kJ/mol for H2O(l), find the enthalpy of formation of C2H2(g).

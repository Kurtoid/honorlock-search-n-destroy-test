On blank paper (or graph paper, if you have some already out), draw a Free Body Diagram (FBD) for each object described below. Label each force. Pay attention to the lengths of your vectors. They do not need to be exactly to length (you don't have enough information!), but the relative sizes are important. 2a) A ball, falling downward and colliding with the floor.  Draw an FBD for the time period when the ball is moving downward, but is in contact with the floor and is slowing down. Ignore air resistance.    2b) Skier, holding onto a rope, being lowered down the hill. Consider friction.  2c) A girl who has jumped into the air.  Draw the FBD for the time after she has left the floor and is on the way upward.    2d) (8 pts)  A man is pushing on Box B to the left at increasing speed.  Note: Box A is in contact with Box B, but the two boxes are not attached.  Consider friction.  Draw 3 FBDs- one for Box A, one for Box B, and one for the system of Boxes A and B.   In the box below, describe any 3rd Law pairs that you see among the forces shown in your 3 FBDs for 2d.  For example: The ______ force on the FBD of the __________ is a 3rd law pair to the ________force on the FBD of the ______________.

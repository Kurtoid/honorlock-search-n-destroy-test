On August 7, 2014, Johnny Cash did not appear in court (he forgot about the case because he was on another drinking binge), and the Judge issued a warrant for his arrest.  The judge later set aside that warrant when Johnny came to court to ask the judge to do so; the trial was reset for September 1, 2014.

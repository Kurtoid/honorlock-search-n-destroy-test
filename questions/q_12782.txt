Festge Park is located 20 minutes away from Minneapolis, MN and 40 minutes away from St. Paul, MN.  Suppose that these twin cities have 1,000,000 inhabitants each, and residents in both cities have the same income and preferences for regional parks. Assume that the cost for an individual to go to a regional park is represented by the cost of the time it takes him or her to get to the park. Also assume that the cost of time for individuals in Minneapolis and St. Paul is $0.25 per minute. You observe that each inhabitant of Minneapolis goes to Festge Park two times a year while each inhabitant of St. Paul goes to the park only once a year. Assume the following: the only people who go to the park are the residents of Minneapolis and St. Paul; the parks annual operating costs are $3,000,000 a year; and the prevailing discount rate is 10% for public expenditures. Finally, assume that the park will never be sold or cease to operate (it will 'last' forever).

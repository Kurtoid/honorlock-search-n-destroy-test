You finish the test and look over the results. The readout gives you a number of results, including the average velocity and centripetal acceleration produced by the patient. While the centripetal acceleration given appears reasonable, your physical intuition tells you that the velocity does not make sense. Instead of re-running the test, you remember a formula from your physics class that may help out. Realizing that the length of the leg is equal to the radius of the circular path of the motion, you carefully measure the leg and find that it is 0.5m. If the centripetal acceleration was 2m/s2, what was the velocity?

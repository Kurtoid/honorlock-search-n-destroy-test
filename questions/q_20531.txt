Ben and Kate had been negotiating Ben's employment contract in conversations over the phone for a couple of weeks. Finally, they agreed on some contract terms. Kate offered to create a draft of the contract for Ben to read over. On the same day Ben was fired from his job. Afraid he would be unemployed, Ben signed Kate's draft, without reading it. In this example, Ben:

A cart in an amusement park is launched on a rollercoaster by a gigantic spring as shown in the figure above. The spring constant is 800 kN/m, (1kN/m=1000 N/m) and the initial compression of the spring is 120 cm. The mass of the cart together with the passengers is 2000 kg. Point B is at the top of a circular loop of radius 10.0 m. When the cart is reaching the top of the loop, its speed is 11.0 m/s. a) (3p) What is the initial potential energy of the compressed gigantic spring? Show work for a partial credit! b) (4p) What is the mechanical energy of the cart at point B? Show work for a partial credit! c) (4p) What is the work done by non-conservative forces during time interval the cart is moving from point A to point B? Show work for a partial credit! d) (6p) What is the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the track on the cart at point B? You must show work starting with Fnet=ma. e) (8p) If the non-conservative forces do the same amount of work when the cart is moving from point B to point C as when the cart is moving from point A to point B, what is the speed of the cart at point C? You must show work starting with one of the work-energy theorems. Answering all parts of the question, make sure to specify correct units in your final answers. Points will be taken otherwise.

The data are taken from the March 2009 and 2010 CPS files. Wages refer to average weekly wages for the previous year, that is, for 2008 and 2009. This is a sample of never married women, ages 25 - 64 during the workyear. Each woman worked at least 20 hours per week, earned at least $8 per week but no more than $10,230.77 per week, and had at least 10 years of education.

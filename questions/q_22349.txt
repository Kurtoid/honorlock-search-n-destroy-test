Rather than maintain a network of showrooms across the country, the business will now let customers choose several styles that interest them from an online site, and will ship samples of each of the styles to the customer to test in their home free of charge. Once they have settled on a tile choice, Rock Bottom will send a representative to their home to schedule installation. The company has determined that busy middle-class customers will value the convenience of the new model, which allow them to upgrade the look of their homes without spending time browsing showrooms.

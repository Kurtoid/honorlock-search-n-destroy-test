4.2   Lees die volgende gevallestudie en beantwoord die vrae wat volg:                 Willem het 'n goeie oog en 'n natuurlike talent wanneer dit by fotografie kom. Hy het 'n kursus tydens sy vakansie gedoen om sy fotografie vaardighede te verbeter. Willem besluit om sy dienste te adverteer sodat hy ekstra geld kan maak en in sy nuwe stokperdjie kan bele. Hy het 'n goeie kwaliteit kamera en 'n skootrekenaar. Willem hou daarvan om foto's van die natuur te neem. Hy benodig 'n spesiale lens sodat hy goeie langafstand foto's kan neem. Daar is ook 'n paar "gadgets" wat Willem wil aanskaf wat sy taak sal vergemaklik. Hierdie spesiale lens kos omtrent R1 500 met 'n addisionele R1 000 vir al die ekstra toebehore wat hy wil he.   Willem se tarief is R350 per uur wat baie laer is as wat die meeste ander fotograwe vra. Hy hoop met hierdie laer tarief sal hy meer kliente trek en ook meer ervaring opdoen. Hy het sy eerste groot taak gekry toe sy vriendin hom gevra het om foto's vir haar troue te neem. Hulle het ooreengekom dat hy vir 5 ure sal werk.               4.2.1   Weens al die COVID 19 beperkings - dink jy hierdie idee van Willem is 'n potensieel winsgewende geleentheid? Jou antwoord moet gemotiveer word om punte te verdien.   (3)

Lake House. Harry has two houses, a house on the lake and a house in town. Rebecca wants to buy the house on the lake. Harry and Rebecca orally agree that Rebecca will buy the house on the lake for $300,000. Harry hurriedly writes out a contract providing that he would sell "his house" to Rebecca for $300,000. Harry signs the top of the document. Rebecca does not sign at all. No merger clause is included in the contract. Harry backs out of the contract, and Rebecca sues him. He tells the judge that the statute of frauds is not satisfied because he did not sign the document at the end and because Rebecca did not sign at all.

Which of the following is true regarding Harry's assertion that the statute of frauds is not satisfied because he did not sign the document at the end?

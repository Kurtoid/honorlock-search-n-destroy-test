Credo company, with 2 million shares outstanding, is for the first time considering a payout in regular cash dividends of $0.25 per share starting in 1 year. Credo currently has $2 million in cash.

A stock analyst forecasts the following years' uncertain future cash flows of Credo company as follows. Scenario               Probability           FCF in 1 year           FCF in 2 years           FCF in 3 years Recession               10%                   -$2,500,000             -$3,250,000               -$4,550,000 Stable                      60%                     $800,000                 $1,000,000                $920,000 Boom                       30%                    $1,500,000              $1,250,000                $1,750,000 Which of the following statements are true? Ignore taxes. I. Credo will be able to cover both its dividend and debt payments through its cash holdings and internally generated expected cash inflows in the next three years. II. The market will react negatively to the dividend announcement because Credo will not be able to commit to the dividend over the next three years without costly external financing. III. To preserve investment capacity, it could be prudent for Credo to conduct a flexible buyback program instead of the regular dividend program. IV. Although the probability of a recession is low, the impact of a recession on free cash flow is large enough for expected financial distress costs to render the dividend program unsustainable.

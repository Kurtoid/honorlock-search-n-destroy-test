Write an essay in which you reflect upon what you have learned this semester about our course themes, anxiety, depression, mindfulness, and / or neuroplasticity.  Draw your examples from at least three of the following readings assigned this semester:  Hanson's Hardwiring Happiness, Lukianoff and Haidt's "Anxiety and Depression," Fredrickson's Positivity, and Tan's Search Inside Yourself . . .   Note that, per instructions given earlier, your examples for the final exam, should be selected ONLY from these readings. Discuss specific information from these texts and reflect upon which concepts, studies, statistics, advice, or views you found most and / or least convincing, helpful, intriguing, surprising, or otherwise interesting and why you found them so.  Did any of the information about anxiety, depression, mindfulness, and / or neuroplasticity that you encountered in these course readings either change or confirm your previous assumptions?  Be sure to back up all of your generalizations by citing specific examples from the assigned readings (although you obviously do not need exact quotations or page numbers). When discussing your own experience, you may use the first person.   Your essay should be clearly organized; should have an explicit, one-sentence thesis statement and unified body paragraphs with topic sentences; and should stay directly focused on the assigned topic. Not staying DIRECTLY focused on the exam question would adversely affect your grade. Your essay must be at least 500 words in length. Please do not use all capital letters. Please allow time to proofread your essay after you finish composing it to detect errors made in haste. Good luck and best wishes!

Questions 36 - 40. Suppose that 50,000 women who have never had a breast cancer diagnosis are available and willing to participate in a new screening program of computerized digital mammography. 1132 women had a positive screening test. All of these positive women had a breast biopsy and 136 were diagnosed with breast cancer. Of the 48,868 who screened "negative" on the test, 24 were in fact in the detectable pre-clinical phase. This was determined by following these women and observing that all 24 were diagnosed with breast cancer within one year of the screening test.     A colleague in another city reports that the same screening test (with the same sensitivity and specificity) is achieving a predictive value positive of only 6%. What is the explanation for this?

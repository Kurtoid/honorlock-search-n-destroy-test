Integrating sources in MLA papers     Read the following passage and the information about its source. Then decide whether each student sample uses the source correctly.           ORIGINAL SOURCE      With the liberalization in Africa of the rules governing used-clothing imports in the past ten years, Africans, who keep getting poorer, can now afford to wear better than rags. Many told me that without used clothes they would go naked, which, as one pointed out, is not in their traditional culture. And yet they know that something precious has been lost.

The ocean of used clothes that now covers the continent plays its part in telling Africans that their own things are worthless, that Africans can do nothing for themselves.     Packer, George.

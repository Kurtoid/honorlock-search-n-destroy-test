The line consists of three models of DVRs. The following data is available regarding the models:    Model DVR Selling Price per Unit Variable Cost per Unit  Demand/Year (units)   Model LX 1 $835 $315 1,535   Model LX 2 $515 $210 2,865   Model LX 3 $405 $125 3,535   Model LX 4 $675 $235 3,300      VCI is considering the addition of a fifth model to its line of DVRs. This model would be sold to retailers for $775. The variable cost of this unit is $335. The demand for the new Model LX 5 is estimated to be 2,000 units per year. Forty percent of these unit sales of the new model is expected to come from other models already being manufactured by VCI (20 percent from Model LX 1, 40 percent from LX 2, 20 percent from Model LX 3, and 20 percent from Model LX 4). VCI will incur a fixed cost of $600,000 to add the new model to the line. Based on the preceding data, should VCI add the new Model LX5 to its line of DVRs? Why or Why not?

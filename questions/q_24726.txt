A small metal bead, labeled B, has a charge of -[QA] nC. It is touched to an identical metal bead, labeled C, that has an initial charge of +[QB] nC, so that charge is transferred. Then the beads are separated until the magnitude of the force between them is [F] x 10-4 N. What is the separation between the charges, in cm?
0 < log(.01) < 1

We would like to compare the three models below:  Model 1: MPG=  B0 + B1 Disp*   Model 2: MPG = B0 + B1 Disp* + B2 Horsepower                             (VIF)       (8.68)             (8.68)  Model 3: MPG = B0 + B1 Disp* + B2 Horsepower+ B3Torque                            (VIF)      (55.40)             (16.40)              (91.14) Model 4: MPG = B0 + B1 Disp* +  B2Torque                             (VIF)        (48.26)      (48.26)   (VIF) represents the Variance Inflation Factor when variable (s) was (were) added to the model  * p-value < 0.05 means that the variable is statistically significant. Choose the option that best answers the question.  I. The best model is Model 1.  II. The best model is Model 2 because of VIF being lower than 10. III. More variables, the better, Batman! Model 3 is the best model.  IV.  The highest VIF in model 3 can be explained because the correlation coefficient between Torque and Disp is equal to 0.9895.

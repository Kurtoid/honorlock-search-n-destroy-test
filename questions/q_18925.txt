A company conducted an experiment to investigate the effects of three different processes on the strength of its steel. The investigators randomly divided production of 120 batches of steel production and used 40 for each process. The steel was rated on a scale of 0 to 100 for its strength. The following sample means and standard deviations were obtained: Method                      x-bar                 s     A                             72.08             20.81      B                             51.00             23.72              C                                     63.15                  21.55 The degrees of freedom for the F-test in the above ANOVA are

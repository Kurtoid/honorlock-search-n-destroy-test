Bystydzienski et al.--in their article "High School Is Not Too Late: Developing Girls' Interest and Engagement in Engineering Careers"--discuss the Female Recruits Explore Engineering (FREE) Program. First, what are some SPECIFIC features of the FREE program? For instance, what are some of the projects or activities of the program? In their assessment, Bystydzienski et al. found that the FREE program was largely "successful." They found that the FREE program did, for the most part, generate students' interest in engineering. For instance, by the end of the second year in the program nearly 60 percent of FREE participants "were seriously considering a career in an engineering field." However, Bystydzienski et al. also found that "interest in engineering was not enough" for those female FREE participants who were first-generation and/or low income students. Bystydzienski et al. found that most first-generation and/or low-income females in the FREE program did not major in engineering in college and in fact some did not go to college at all. What were the THREE SPECIFIC FACTORS that accounted for this outcome (i.e., first-generation and/or low-income students either not majoring in engineering or not even going to college in the first place)?

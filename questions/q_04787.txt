A 60-year-old woman presents with recent onset of exertional fatigue and worsening back pain. She is otherwise well with no significant past medical history. Her hemoglobin is 9.6g/dL (normal range 14-17.5 g/dL), with an MCV of 92 (normal range 80-96 um3). Her serum creatinine is 2.9 mg/dL (normal range 0.1-0.4 mg/dL) and calcium of 11.2 mg/dL (normal range 4-4.8 mg/dL). A serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) demonstrates a monoclonal IgA protein of 3.7 g/dL. She has normal serum ferritin, vitamin B12, and folic acid levels. A skeletal survey shows occult lytic lesions in the skull (as shown), cervical spine, and ribs. Bone marrow biopsy shows 30% involvement by abnormal appearing plasma cells, confirmed by CD138+ immunohistochemical stain. Urinalysis was positive for Bence-Jones protein. The secretion of which of the following substances by the tumor cells is most likely responsible for her back pain?       A  Estradiol (E2)    B  Osteoprotegerin (OPG)    C  Chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 3 (CCL3)    D  Macrophage-Colony Stimulating factor (M-CSF)    E  Receptor activator of nuclear factor k B-ligand (RANK-L)

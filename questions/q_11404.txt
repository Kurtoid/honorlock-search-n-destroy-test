Below is a metabolic pathway having 3 chemical reactions and 3 enzymes. Enzyme 1 (E1) has 2 binding sites--1 for the substrate A and another for the end product D. As the pathway proceeds, the end product in higher quantities will react with enzyme 1, blocking the enzyme's binding to the substrate. Which statement is true about this pathway?                      E1        E2         E3         Substrate A ----> B ----> C ----> D end product

You are working for a contractor that has a contract for construction of a new hospital. As part of the project, you need to remove the soil for the construction of the basement and foundation for a parking garage. From the project plans, you know that 5,000 bank cubic yards must be excavated and that 1050 compacted cubic yards will be required to backfill the completed foundation. You plan to stockpile the soil needed for backfill on site and haul the excess soil to a disposal site. The average haul distance is estimated to be 450 ft. with an 8% average uphill grade. The contractor had the soil tested and determined that the bank density is 2,880 pounds per cubic yard, the loose density is 2,300 pounds per cubic yard, and the compacted density is 3,200 pounds per cubic yard.  What is the percent swell for the soil? What is the percent shrinkage for the soil? How many bank cubic yards should be stockpiled to be used for backfill operation? How many loose cubic yards of soil should be hauled away to the disposal site?

You may be asked to create a k-map during the exam.  You can create a digital k-map by inserting a table into your answer box, similar to the one below.   Here is an example k-map for a circuit with four inputs A1, A2, A3, and A4 where A4 is the MSB.  K-Map     A2'  A1' 0   0   A2'  A1 0   1   A2  A1 1  1   A2  A1' 1   0     A4' A3' 0    0  0 0 0 0    A4' A3 0    1  0 1 1 0    A4 A3 1  1  1 1 x 0    A4 A3' 1   0  X 1 1 0    You do not have to show your circles when you answer the problem.  But you do have to use circling to figure out the simplified output expression of the circuit.  You may wish to also draw the k-map on your own paper and draw the circles so that you can determine the output expression. Practice drawing a k-map in the space below.   Determine the expression for the output of the circuit and type it below your k-map. Be sure that you can create a k-map within Canvas during an online exam.  Exam time won't be changed or extended due to an inability to create a k-map within your answer box.  Be sure you can draw a k-map for 3 or 4 variables.

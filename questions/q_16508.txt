You survey a sample of 1000 employees at a large company and record the age of each. The results are given in the frequency distribution table below.  If you select one employee at random, what is the probability the selected employee is more than 24 years old?

Bismarck model countries commonly use price controls and negotiated fee schedules as strategies to contain costs. However, these strategies do not introduce distortions in clinical practice because all providers face the same prices.

Read the following scenario and answer the questions below.  In the early years of the 20th century there were lush stands of tall grasses in the valley on the east side of the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona, stretching to Mexico on the south and New Mexico on the east. Dramatic summer rainstorms dumped huge amounts of water, very quickly, on the rocky upper slopes. The water ran down the slopes and into the grasslands, where it quickly soaked into the soft, porous soil where prairie dogs were active. Cattle ranching was in full swing, utilizing the rich grasses, but the ranchers did not appreciate the multitudes of prairie dogs that lived in the grasslands. Prairie dogs constantly dig through soil, making new burrows and eating grasses, roots and all.  It was commonly believed that cattle would stumble in the prairie dog holes, break legs, and die of starvation. In addition, many ranchers were convinced that the prairie dogs would destroy the grasses because they directly competed with the cattle for food. The ranchers had already done away with most predators that might possibly affect cattle, and now they turned their attention to the prairie dogs. The ranchers became a part of a new federally sponsored movement to poison the grassland prairie dogs. This movement took root and spread through the 1920s and 1930s. Prairie dog activities probably contribute to ________. A) the grass roots being subject to diseases B) the soil being loose and to little nutrient cycling, causing grasses to fall over C) the soil hardening during rains and to little nutrient cycling, causing grasses to die D) the localized extinction of prairie grasses E) the soil being loose and to nutrient cycling, allowing new grass roots to grow and prosper

Wing Foot is a shoe franchise commonly found in shopping centers across the United States. Wing Foot knows that its stores will not show a profit unless they gross over $940,000 per year. Let A be the event that a new Wing Foot store grosses over $940,000 its first year. Let B be the event that a store grosses over $940,000 its second year. Wing Foot has an administrative policy of closing a new store if it does not show a profit in either of the first two years. Assume that the accounting office at Wing Foot provided the following information: 57% of all Wing Foot stores show a profit the first year; 74% of all Wing Foot store show a profit the second year (this includes stores that did not show a profit the first year); however, 80% of Wing Foot stores that showed a profit the first year also showed a profit the second year. Compute P(A and B), if P(A) = 0.57, P(B) = 0.74, and P(B|A) = 0.80. Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.

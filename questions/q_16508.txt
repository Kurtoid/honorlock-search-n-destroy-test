Consider the following BST.  Simulate deleting "10" from this BST using the algorithm described in class. Trace Format: On different lines, first list the label of each node that will be visited in proper order as the algorithm searches for its deletion target. When it finds it, write FOUND. On different lines, then list the label of each node that will be visited in order as the algorithm searches for the node it will use to replace the deleted one. When it finds it, right FOUND. Finally, describe at a high level what is done with the replacement node once it is found.

This is a multi-part problem. Be very careful with balancing the equation properly - as with the rest of the multiple choice problems, no partial credit will be awarded! To prevent line breaking issues, the products and reactants are provided in separate lines. (1 point per blank) Balance the following equation. [Ca] Ca (s) + [AlN] Al(NO3)3 (aq) - [CaN] Ca(NO3)2 (aq) + [Al] Al (s) (2 points) Classify this reaction. [class] (2 points) What is the correct mole ratio of Ca(NO3)2 to Al(NO3)3? [mole] (2 points) If 6.0 mol Ca(NO3)2 were produced in this reaction, how many moles of Al(NO3)3 were consumed? [prod]

Factoring receivables is beneficial to a seller for all of the following reasons except:
After reading the paragraph below, answer the questions that follow.Studies of the endomembrane system often involve the use of a protein that can emit a green fluorescence (glow). A researcher wants to make a video of cell behavior, so she initially labels the outer nuclear envelope of a cell with the fluorescent tag and records a video for several hours. Later, she sees that the tag is part of a transport vesicle very close to the plasma membrane. The ability to stain protein molecules with a fluorescent dye would most clearly allow researchers to go beyond what they could previously detect with a microscope by allowing them to

This is Question D. Please write your solution complete with your full name and the problem number. When you are finished with the auto-graded portion of the exam, upload your solution to the Question D assignment in the Exam 1 module within 15 minutes.  Recall that the set {0,1}* is the set of finite length bit strings defined recursively by the following rules:  Foundation rule: The empty string l [?] {0,1}*. Constructor rule: For s [?] {0,1}*, s1 [?] {0,1}* and s0 [?] {0,1}*.  Consider the recursive function flip which takes a bit strings for input and gives a bit strings as output, defined by the following: Foundation rule: flip(l) = l. Constructor rule: For s [?] {0,1}*, flip(s0) = flip( s )1 and flip( s 0) = flip( s )1.  (5 points.) What is the output when flip is applied to the following strings? For full-credit, you must show the step-by-step application of the flip function.   010 1101 0010   (5 points.) Use structural induction to show that flip(flip(s)) = s for any s [?] {0,1}*.

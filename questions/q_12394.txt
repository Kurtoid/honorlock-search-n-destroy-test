The height of an arch is proportional to the height of the column it sits on according to the Golden Ratio, with the column being taller than the arch, as shown in the image below. If the arch has a height of LV centimeters, what will be the height of the column?  Write your answer in Roman numerals and round to the nearest whole number!

The illustration below shows some of Earth's tectonic plates. The arrows indicate the direction in which some of these plates are moving.Based on the direction of the Cocos Plate, what type of plate boundary likely exists between the Cocos Plate and the Caribbean Plate? (Hint: Step 1. Analyze the likely relative motions of the Caribbean Plate and the Cocos Plate. Step 2. Relate the relative motions of plates to the type of plate boundary.)
Poetry. "The Road Not Taken."    BY ROBERT FROST Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;              5   Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,            10   And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black.

In a separate file, write a void return type function that takes in as parameters an integer 1-D array and the number of items being used in the array as well as two other parameters. The function will have OUTGOING data of the minimum and maximum values in the array. Elements in the array that have a value of -1 are considered "empty" all other values in the array are valid.  You may assume at the first index in the array is not empty. This function must have a void return type.  There should be no standard/file input or output in this function. Do not write the main function.  Do not declare or initialize the array, assume it's values have been set by some other part of the code and is being passed to your function.

ASSEMBLY OF BARS OF ARBITRARY ORIENTATION Three BAR elements are assembled as shown in the figure.  All the elements have the different Elastic Modulus (Ej), Cross-Sectional Area (Aj), and length (Lj).  The subscript, "j" corresponds to the element number, "Ej" in the figure. The subscript, j=1 for element, E1; j=2 for element, E2; and j=3 for element, E3.  Further assume that:          (a)        Write the stiffness matrix for each element.  Show all your work.

I will not tell a lie--I am going to tell the truth. You love your country-- you love your people--you love the manner in which they live, and you think your people are brave.--I am like you, my Great Father, I love my country. I love my people--I love the manner in which we live, and think myself and warriors brave. Spare me then, my Father; let me enjoy my country, and pursue the buffalo, and the beaver, and the other wild animals of our country, and I will trade their skins with your people.

We have plenty of buffalo, beaver, deer and other wild animals--we have also an abundance of horses--we have everything we want--we have plenty of land, if you will keep your people off of it.

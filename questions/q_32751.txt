According to Ben Bernanke's lectures, which of the following is NOT a problem associated with the gold standard?
Ilaria Marciano, the founder and sole owner of Gelato Bello, an ice cream business, is an old friend and client of yours.  She has approached you for advice on the following matters: Answer the questions completely, using the law, rates and allowances applicable for the 2020/21 tax year.  If you believe you do not have sufficient information to answer a question, explain what further information you require. 2a) Although Gelato Bello is quite successful, after 10 years in the business Ms Marciano is getting bored of ice cream.  She is thinking of selling Gelato Bello and starting a new venture.  She has told you that she is considering two options.  The first is to sell Gelato Bello to another ice cream business.  However, she is unhappy with the possibility that a new owner might fold the business into its existing brand.  The second option is to sell the business to her niece Giuseppina Marciano.  Her niece, of whom she is very fond, has been working at Gelato Bello for more than five years, is passionate about artisanal ice cream and has plans to expand the business in Dorset and Hampshire. Based on conversations with her accountants and some very initial discussions with potential purchasers, she believes she would be able to get PS750,000 for Gelato Bello if it were sold to a third party.  The accountants have assessed the value of the business as PS500,000 for the office, factory and shops, PS225,000 for goodwill and PS25,000 for company vehicles.  The various premises were acquired for a total of PS300,000 and the vehicles for PS50,000. Alternatively, Ms Marciano would be willing to sell the business to her niece for PS600,000.  As part of the sale, she would lend Giuseppina PS200,000 for five years, interest-free. Either sale would take place during the 2020/21 tax year.   a) Describe and calculate the tax consequences to Ms Marciano of a sale of Gelato Bello to a third party for PS750,000.  In 2020/21, Gelato Bello generated PS50,000 in trading profits.  Assume that Ms Marciano's only other income for the year is PS3,000 in interest on various accounts.  Discuss all relevant reliefs.

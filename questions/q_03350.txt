Directions: This question and the previous two contain a picture of classroom objects.Identify any 10 objects total displayed in these 3 pictures, using vocabulary from the word bank. Don't forget the indefinite definite article un/une.  Look at all of the pictures first, then decide which objects to label. You can label any objects you choose across the 3 pictures, and you do not have to label objects in every picture. Just make sure that you label a total of 10 objects over the course of these three pictures/questions. If you don't label any items in a given picture, your test may tell you that you have not answered the question, but I will be manually grading this, so do not worry. What's essential is that you label 10 objects total. In your response, you can type the letter next of the object and then give the word in French. Type as many objects in the answer space as your are labeling for a given picture. Ex: (N) [you give the French for a pen]        (P) [you give the French for a cell phone]        (Q) [you give the French for a book], etc.Do not forget the indefinite article un or une.   bureau            examen                       montre                        porte cahier              fenetre                        mur                             pupitre chaise             horloge                       ordinateur                  stylo craie                livre                             plafond                       table crayon             lumiere                       portable                      tableau

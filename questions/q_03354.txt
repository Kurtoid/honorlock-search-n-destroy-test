Lectura  Read Juan's blog entry, then mark each statement as cierto or falso.      !Hola, amigos!Ya estoy aqui otra vez. No pude escribir nada la semana pasada porque estuve mareado y con escalofrios (shivers). Me dolia el pecho (chest), tenia tos y estaba de mal humor. !Tenia gripe! Y creo que se por que. Estuve en casa de mi hermano Joaquin, que tiene tres hijos pequenos. Y donde hay ninos pequenos, hay virus. De hecho (In fact), Luisito, el mas pequeno, tenia fiebre.

A farmer grows and sells flowering plants. The best-selling plants are the ones with the most blossoms. The farmer reads an advertisement for a plant food saying that it will make plants grow faster and taller. The farmer predicts that taller plants will have more blossoms and performs the following experiment to test this hypothesis.   Two groups of 10 plants are grown in identical pots filled with equal amounts of identical soil. The amount of sunlight, the room temperature, and the amount of water are held constant for both groups. Group A is given plant food at regular intervals according to the instructions on the package. Group B is not given plant food. The farmer observes the plants after 15 weeks of growth. The results are recorded below.   State the farmer's original hypothesis.  Based on the results of the experiment, was his original hypothesis correct? Explain your answer. Explain why the amount of sunlight, the room temperature, and the amount of water were held constant for both groups. Identify the different variables in your response.

Name the author and title for this quotation: When she reached L'Abri she shuddered at the first sight of it, as she always did. It was a sad looking place, which for many years had not known the gentle presence of a mistress, old Monsieur Aubigny having married and buried his wife in France, and she having loved her own land too well ever to leave it. The roof came down steep and black like a cowl, reaching out beyond the wide galleries that encircled the yellow stuccoed house. Big, solemn oaks grew close to it, and their thick-leaved, far-reaching branches shadowed it like a pall. Young Aubigny's rule was a strict one, too, and under it his negroes had forgotten how to be gay, as they had been during the old master's easy-going and indulgent lifetime.

DIRECTIONS: Choose the best answer for each question. Sextuplets [A] Most of us have met a pair of twins or triplets once or twice in our lives. But how many people know a set of sextuplets: six children born at the same time to the same mother? Not very many of us have. This is why the Dilley family is so famous.[B] Keith and Becki Dilley got married in 1986 and wanted to have children right away. After five years of no children, doctors gave Becki a special medication to help her get pregnant. It worked! But Becki wasn't pregnant with just one baby. She was pregnant with five - or that's what the doctors thought at first. [C] On May 25, 1993, Becki went to the hospital to give birth. The doctor delivered five healthy babies before Becki felt a sixth set of feet. The last Dilley baby, the sixth one, was quite a surprise. The babies had to stay in the hospital for several months. Some of them needed special machines to help them breathe. Others were so small and fragile that Becki and Keith could not hold them. After three months, the babies were finally able to go home.[D] Life in the Dilley household was quite busy, as anyone can imagine. There were six diapers to change, six bottles to prepare, six tiny outfits to wash, and so on. Thankfully, the Dilleys had family nearby who could help carry the load. Grandparents, aunts, and uncles all pitched in to help.[E] The sextuplets are grown up now. They have families of their own and work at various jobs. They seem to be just like other young adult, but they always have an amazing story to tell.What does the word fragile mean in paragraph C?

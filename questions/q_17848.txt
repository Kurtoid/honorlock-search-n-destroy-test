Prevention against injury involves a combination of two types of preventive measures.  First is active prevention, which refers to methods that require people to do something to reduce the risk of being injured.  Examples include the use of nonautomatic seat belts, the use of bicycle and motorcycle helmets, following drunk driving laws, and obeying gun laws.  The second type of preventive measure is passive prevention.  Passive prevention refers to method requiring little or no action on the part of those being protected.  The measures include seat belts that automatically engage when a person enters a car, automobile air bags, better street lighting, and built-in safety switches  on power tools and electrical equipment. _________23.

Short Answer Scenario 1: Imagine that you read a news headline that states: "Instagram use is linked to sadness." In the study, a group of high school students were asked to indicate how many times a day they checked their Instagram accounts and how sad they were by responding to a self-report sadness scale. The results suggested that there was a positive relationship between Instagram use and sadness that was statistically significant.  Part 1: Identify and define the four main validities used to interrogate research claims. Part 2: Draft a specific question you would ask the researchers of this study for each of the four forms of validity.  Your question must be specific to this scenario! If a particular validity is not relevant to this type of claim, please still define the validity but indicate that "not relevant to interrogate". Note: you do not need to answer the questions you draft. Grading:  Identify & define the four main validities (4 points).  Four specific validity questions for this scenario, 1 per validity (4 points).

Use the excerpt below, entitled "The Weak Case for Public Schooling," to answer the question that follows.  Excerpt from "The Weak Case for Public Schooling," by David Friedman One argument that government schooling is necessary is that, being themselves inadequately educated, parents are incompetent to choose schooling for their children. As John Stuart Mill put it, "The uncultivated cannot be competent judges of cultivation." This argument concedes that government schools will teach what the state wants children to learn instead of what their parents want them to learn, but views that as an advantage of the government system. This argument seems to justify at most one generation of government schooling. Once we educate the first generation, they should then be competent to choose an education for their children. The U.S. and Britain have now had universal government schooling for at least five or six generations. If it has done a good job of educating students it should now be unnecessary, and if it has done a bad job perhaps we should try something else. A further problem with the argument is that most of what the government schools actually teach-or, too often, fail to teach-is well within the comprehension of virtually all parents. Insofar as the main business of the schools is to teach children the basic skills needed to function in our society, the children's parents are usually competent to judge how good a job is being done. Even a parent who cannot read can still tell whether his child can. And, while a few educational issues may go beyond the parents' competence to judge, parents qua parents, like parents qua taxpayers, have the option of making use of other people's expert opinion. The crucial difference between the two roles is that a parent deciding what school his child shall go to has a far stronger incentive to form as accurate an opinion as possible than does a parent deciding how to vote. Parental preferences have often clashed with "expert educational opinion," but it has not always been the parents who turned out to be in the wrong. Thus in Scotland, around 1800, parents "Increasingly resisted traditional parochial school emphasis on classical languages and Religion. Parents complained that their children did not get their due in the school `By not having been teached [sic] writing.'"Modern examples might include the controversies associated with the shift away from phonics and towards the look-see approach to teaching literacy and the introduction of the "new math" somewhat later-both arguably among the causes of the massive decline in the output of the American school system from 1960 to 1980. Parents have to live with the results of educational experiments; the educators can always go on to a new generation of experimental subjects. -adapted from "The weak Case for Public Schooling," by David Friedman [END] Question: What is the author's overall point or thesis for the selection?

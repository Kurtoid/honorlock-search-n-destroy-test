Mr. Murphy is a 45 year old advertising executive who presents to the emergency room complaining of the passage of black tarry stools x 3 days and an associated lightheadedness. He also relates that he cannot keep up with his usual schedule because of fatigability. He further complains of recent worsening of a chronic epigastric burning which had been a problem off/on for years. He had doubled his usual dose of Tums without significant relief of the burning. He has 2-3 martinis at lunch and another cocktail before dinner. He takes NSAIDS as needed for back pain and recently started on one aspirin per day for cardiac prophylaxis. He smokes two packs of cigarettes per day and an occasional cigar. He has h/o ulcer in the distant past but had no specific evaluation or treatment. PMH is negative for abdominal surgery, bleeding tendencies or prior transfusion. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Examination reveals an alert, oriented, overweight male. He appears anxious and somewhat restless. Vital signs are as follows: BP 120/80 mmHg, HR 110/min in supine; BP 90/60 mmHg; HR thready in standing (Patient complains of dizziness upon standing). Respiratory Rate 20 breaths per minute; Temperature 98 F.  HE-ENT/SKIN: Facial pallor and cool, moist skin are noted. ABDOMEN/RECTUM: The abdomen reveals a rounded abdomen. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. There is moderate tenderness in the epigastrium.  LABORATORY TESTS:  Hemoglobin 9gm/dL, Hematocrit 27%, MCV 90. WBC 13,000/mm. PT/PTT normal. BUN 45mg/dL, Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL. Chest x-ray normal. X-ray of abdomen (KUB) is unremarkable.   21.  Murphy was diagnosed with a gastrointestinal bleed.

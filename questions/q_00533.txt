The bodies of three-spine stickleback fish in certain populations evolved as they adapted from living in the ocean to a life exclusively in freshwater environments. One adaptation was the loss of pelvic spines, which are homologous to the hind limbs of four-legged animals. Scientists have determined that changes to the stickleback pelvis are largely due to changes in a particular gene regulatoryswitch, a stretch of noncoding DNA sequence that functions to turn genes on or off. Mutations in gene switches that control developmental genes are an important evolutionary mechanism responsible for the diversity of animal forms

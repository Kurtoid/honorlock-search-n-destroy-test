Wing Foot is a shoe franchise commonly found in shopping centers across the United States. Wing Foot knows that its stores will not show a profit unless they gross over $940,000 per year. Let A be the event that a new Wing Foot store grosses over $940,000 its first year. Let B be the event that a store grosses over $940,000 its second year. Wing Foot has an administrative policy of closing a new store if it does not show a profit in either of the first two years.

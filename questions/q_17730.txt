Operative Report Preoperative Diagnosis: Chronic laryngitis with polypoid disease Postoperative Diagnosis: Same Procedure: Laryngoscopy with removal of polyps After adequate premedication, the 60-year-old female patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position. The patient was given a general oral endotracheal anesthetic with a small endotracheal tube. The Jako laryngoscope was then inserted. There were noted to be large polyps on both vocal cords, essentially obstructing the glottis airway when the tube was in place. The polyps appeared larger on the right cord. Using the straight-cup forceps, the polyps were removed from the left cord first. The polyps were removed from the right cord up to the anterior commissure. There was very minimal bleeding noted. This opened up the airway extremely well. The patient was extubated and sent to recovery in good condition. Assign the apppropriate CPT code(s).

The authors produced the H. pylori putP protein in E. coli to study its properties further (see Question 2).  In one example, E. coli cells that produced the H. pylori putP protein were incubated with 50 mM NaCl and 10 micromolar radioactive 14C L-Pro, then radioactivity accumulated inside the cells was measured over time (closed circles).  For comparison, the same study was carried out with E. coli cells that did not produce the H. pylori putP protein (closed triangles).  The data are shown below.  Choose the correct conclusion from these experiments.

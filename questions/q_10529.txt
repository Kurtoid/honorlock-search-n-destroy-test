We want to reduce the output of a 35 kW engine running at 5040 rev/min down 2040 rpm to using a 25deg steel (hardened to 400HB) pinion and cast iron gear. The module is 6 mm, the gears have a quality rating of 9, and a life of 6x109 cycles at 99.99% reliability. Determine the AGMA contact stress on the pinion. Certain quantities have already been calculated. You need to fill in all the remaining entries in the table below.

Suppose that Medicare would like to test the hypothesis that the average monthly rate for  one-bedroom assisted-living facility is equal to  $3,300. A random sample of 12  assisted-living facilities had an average rate of  $3,690 per month. The standard deviation for this sample was  $530. Medicare would like to set a = 0.05.   What is the standard error of the mean for this hypothesis test?

Based on the following normal DNA sequence answer questions A - E.                    3'...T A C C C C G G T A C G A A C...5' A. The complementary mRNA sequence will be [A]. (Write only the letters. Do not put spaces between the letters).   B. The amino acid sequence will then be [B]. (Only write the three letter abbreviation for each amino acid; put a space between the abbreviated words) Codon table   C. This normal (original) sequence of DNA is most likely at the [C] of the gene. (Fill in the blank with either start, middle, or end.)   D. Assuming that a change occurred in the second T of the DNA sequence such that the sequence now reads             3'...T A C C C C G G C A C G A A C... 5.'                                                                             This would be a [D] mutation. (Fill in the blank with either silent mutation, a missense mutation, or a nonsense mutation.)   E. When you wrote the mRNA sequence in Question A above, you were pretending to be the enzyme [E]. (Fill in the blank with either RNA polymerase, DNA polymerase I, DNA polymerase III, or ribosome.)

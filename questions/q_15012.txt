Read the following email message that was sent to all UW-Madison employees on 3/15/21, and then respond to the questions labeled Part A - Part F that follow. ### To our employees, As you may know, we are making important investments to improve essential administrative functions. In conjunction with the Administrative Transformation Program, the Procure-to-Pay Automation Project Team will launch Shop UW+, a centrally supported system for purchasing and payments, on April 16. The launch of this new platform is a major step toward standardizing business processes and improving efficiency on our campus and campuses across the UW System. Purchasing activity that had been supported by Shop@UW will transition to ShopUW+. Requisitions, direct payments, and payments to individuals supported by paper or electronic forms submitted by intercampus mail or email will also flow though ShopUW+. New easy access will be available to staff using NetID rather than an MD number. Since last fall, hundreds of representatives from schools, colleges and divisions have been providing insight into the user experience of the new platform, as well as representatives from the other System institutions. As a result, we will see benefits in the areas of user experience, compliance, and business processes including: Enhanced user experience *         Visibility to status*         Workflows with electronic approvals*         Access to supporting documentation*         Integrated systems Increased compliance*         Stronger financial internal controls*         Greater financial oversight*         On-contract spend Improved business processes *         Streamlined business processes*         Reduction in errors*         Increased discounts and contract incentives*         Data available to support decision-making I am confident that our campus community will adopt ShopUW+ and embrace the new business processes. Learn more about ShopUW+ on the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Automation project website.

Recently, while observing endangered Great Green Macaws on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, I noted several behavioral and physiological phenomena practiced by this amazing species. It was the beginning of the nesting season, and the adult birds had already established cavity nesting sites and laid eggs. One parent usually remained in the nest to incubate the eggs. This species has a tight connection with the mountain almond tree where it nests and feeds on almonds which I observed. The mountain almond was clearly a dominant member of the rainforest ecosystem where the macaws are found. Despite having many other abundant food resources available, this flock had inherited a preference for the mountain almond, and beak size that is larger than the scarlet macaw which has an overlapping habitat in some areas. Some scientists have hypothesized that the larger beak allows the birds to effectively crack the shells of the larger nuts that they feed on. Which properties of life have I observed and noted here?

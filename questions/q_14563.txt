Consider the network setup in the figure below:  [text version of the figure, in case the image is not showing:               ]     The network device X in the given figure changes the packet headers in order to use only one globally unique IP address for the LAN on the right. The connection established includes a message sent from the LAN to the WAN (direction (1) and (2)), and then a reply from the other side of that connection in the WAN back to the LAN (direction (3) and (4)).  We call this device a [b1].  The fields this device changes in the packet headers are:  [b2] in the (1)-to-(2) direction, and [b3] in the (3)-to-(4) direction. The main advantages of using the above device include: [b4], and [b5]. Three contexts in which the application of the above device is commonly used include: [b6], [b7], and [b8]. A valid entry in the above table according to scenario by (1) is [b9]. Complete the diagram by adding the numbers for the steps  (2),  (3), and (4) [assume random ports as 2000, 2001, ... if/as needed]:             In step (2)  S= IP [b10], port [b11], and D= IP [b12], port [b13]             In step (3)  S= IP [b14], port [b15], and D= IP [b16], port [b17]              In step  (4) S= IP [b18] , port [b19], and D= IP [b20], port [b21]

The production of acetanilide(C8H9NO) involves the treatment of aniline(C6H7N) with acetic anhydride(C4H6O3).  This reaction produces an amide called acetanilide(C8H9NO) and the byproduct acetic acid (C2H4O2).  The reaction is as follows: aniline        +         acetic anhydride         --------->      acetanilide             +          acetic acid C6H7N                          C4H6O3                                      C8H9NO                               C2H4O2 molar mass C6H7N = 93.13g/mol              molar mass C4H6O3 = 102.09g/mol molar mass C8H9NO = 135.16g/mol         molar mass  C2H4O2 = 60.05g/mol Since aniline(C6H7N) is a liquid, conversion from milliliters to grams will yield the equivalence of 4.000 grams of aniline(C6H7N). Calculate the theoretical mass of acetanilide(C8H9NO) produced when the mass of aniline(C6H7N) used in the reaction equals to 4.000g. The reaction goes 100% to completion and aniline(C6H7N) is the limiting reagent. Select the best choice. (*hint: reaction balanced?)

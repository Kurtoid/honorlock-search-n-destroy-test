(Q001) The Texas executive branch has similarities to the federal executive branch. The governor, like the president, is the chief executive. The governor is the commander in chief of military forces in the state, has the power to appoint people to various administrative offices, and is responsible for making sure that the laws are faithfully executed. But unlike the president and vice president, who run on the same ticket, the governor and lieutenant governor are elected separately. Moreover, the governor does not have a cabinet that he or she appoints and controls. The secretary of state is appointed by the governor, but the comptroller, the attorney general, the land commissioner, and the agriculture commissioner are all elected separately. We call this a plural executive system because executive power is divided among different officeholders. Current Governor Greg Abbott, Attorney General Ken Paxton, and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick are just a few of the people that today make up Texas's plural executive.Many other states follow the federal model or single executive model, so that the governor and lieutenant governor are elected to office together. The governor then appoints all of the relevant officeholders to run the executive branch. In these instances, the attorney general, the secretary of state, the agriculture commissioner, and all other "cabinet" officials are appointed by the governor and serve at his or her pleasure.Advocates of the plural executive model argue that a decentralized system of power within the executive branch helps guard against abuses of power. The Texas Constitution intentionally provides for a weak governorship, and the plural executive is one way to guarantee this. If the attorney general and other statewide officials are not beholden to the governor, they will not necessarily support the governor's agenda. Supporters of the Texas model also argue that it is more democratic in that the electorate has a larger role to play in the selection of executive officers.Opponents of the plural executive model argue that it makes it difficult for the governor to govern effectively and creates a counterproductive tug of war among all of the separately elected officials. In the federal model, the president can decide who is best suited for a particular role and delegate power accordingly. The Texas governor, on the other hand, cannot give orders to the lieutenant governor or the attorney general, thus making it more difficult to run the state in a responsible manner.In Texas's recent past, Republican governor George W. Bush had to work alongside Democratic lieutenant governor Bob Bullock in order to pass his legislative agenda. Some observers saw this forced cooperation as a positive effect of the plural executive, because it required compromise for the good of the state. Opponents of the plural executive might have seen it as a negative effect, because it undermined the power of the governor to implement his agenda. Each form of governance has its benefits and its costs for democracy.Is the plural executive more democratic than the single executive model? Does it lead to more efficient and accountable government? Why or why not?

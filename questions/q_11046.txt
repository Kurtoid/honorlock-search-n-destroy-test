Equation Sheet Exam 1.pdf    1.  Give a complete description of the resonance phenomena.  Complete your answer by sketching the graph of the absolute value of the magnification factor of an undamped system as a function of the ratio of the forced to the natural frequency (ff  / fn).  Identify clearly where "resonance" occurs on the graph. (10 pts)   2. A 9-kg gaming computer is set on a vibration table and exposed to a forced sine vibration, to investigate the performance of its packaging system.  The maximum acceleration and amplitude of the table are controlled at 29 m/s2 and 1.5 cm, respectively. Inside the carton, the computer sits on four corner cushions that combine for an effective k-value of 5131 N/m. Preliminary test shipments, revealed problems with the motherboard, which as natural frequency of 17.0 Hz.  a.  At what frequency, will the computer and its motherboard vibrate on the table? Will it be the same? (5 pts)  b.  Calculate the maximum acceleration and amplitude of both the computer and its motherboard. (15 pts)   BONUS (5 pts)Based on the results obtained from the previous test, a new material is tested for the corner cushions. A sine-sweep test revealed a natural frequency of 4.5 Hz for cushions-computer system. Calculate the k-value of one of the corner cushion assuming that they all experience the same deformation.

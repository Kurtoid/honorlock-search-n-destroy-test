Based on the article below, please identify three competitive priorities/capabilities that logistics operators can improve by using warehouse robots instead of workers (out of the nine we learned in the course). For each of the competitive priority/capability you identified, shortly describe (1-2 sentences) how it applies to logistics operators and how it will enable them to improve their warehouse operations.    The following text appeared in the WSJ on 05/24/2021 (excerpts): Warehouses Look to Robots to Fill Labor Gaps  The robots are coming to labor-strapped North American warehouses. Growing numbers of self-driving machines are shuttling clothing and sports equipment down warehouse aisles, pulling bins of groceries, cosmetics and industrial parts from high stacks and handing off goods to human workers to help deliver orders faster. Some logistics operators are testing forklifts that can be operated from remote locations, allowing employers in tight labor markets to draw from a geographically broader pool of workers. The push toward automation comes as businesses say they can't hire warehouse workers fast enough to meet surging online demand for everything from furniture to frozen food in pandemic-disrupted supply chains. The crunch is accelerating the adoption of robots and other technology in a sector that still largely relies on workers pulling carts. Logistics-automation companies say demand for their technology has grown during the pandemic as companies look for ways to cope with big swings in volume when workers are scarce and social distancing requirements limit building occupancy. Users say mobile robots and other logistics technology can also boost output and efficiency, helping businesses handle sudden spikes in demand without investing millions of dollars in fixed infrastructure. XPO Logistics Inc. said its use of robots in warehousing operations increased efficiency by as much as six times in some cases. The company plans to roughly double the number of robots in its warehouses this year. Jennifer Smith, WSJ  (05/24/21)

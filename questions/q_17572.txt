Final Exam     In an essay of at least five (5) well-developed paragraphs, answer the following question.  Be sure to directly quote from at least three (3) works we discussed over the course of the semester and correctly document those quotations with parenthetical, in-text citations.  You are free to reference any work covered in our class in your support of your clearly formulated thesis statement in this essay.  You must quote and cite the Chametzky article and any other work you reference in your response.    Some guidelines:    Type your response in the box provided by this exam.  Do not write in Word or other program outside the test.  Do your best formatting your paper; the functional limitations of the test will not allow a running header or page number. Remember that your essay must contain an introduction, at least three (3) body paragraphs in support of your thesis, and a conclusion. I strongly urge you to take a few minutes to plan your essay with a brief outline, webbing, or any prewriting strategy that allows you to clarify your thoughts and keep on track as you produce your essay. I strongly urge you to take the time to proofread your essay, revising and editing to ensure that your meaning is clearly conveyed. Remember that any research paper utilizing another author's ideas requires a Works Cited page as well as in-text citations for every use of a quotation, summary, and paraphrase.    Consider the following quotation from Jules Chametzky's essay that we discussed in class:   "That, of course, is an answer, but no answer to the woman's question posed in [The Awakening], how to be free in one's self and for one's self but still meaningfully connected to others.  Posed in this way, the question, of course, applies to everyone."  (201)     The Question:   How have three authors we read in this class answered the question of how to be free in themselves and for themselves while engaging in fulfilling relationships with other people and with society in general?   In other words, how have these people managed to be true to themselves without living in isolation?  Please note that this question does not apply strictly to either gender.  It is a question all humans must answer for themselves in order to live well and completely.   Citing a Work in a Single Container A Work in an Anthology   Author. "Title." Title of Anthology.

Taking the exam and being ready is your personal responsibility as a student. If you have any problems during the test, you have to contact IT help desk (and get an IT ticket) and email me simultaneously explaining the problem. Make sure to get a IT helpDesk Ticket Number for further referencing.  Honorlock has an online chat function as well, if you have problems with Honor lock.  If the problem is not due to your preparation and not being ready for the test, then I will communicate with you the next step. Those who don't/can't take the test without any legitimate reason will receive zero for this test. Contacting IT help desk does not mean that you are excused from the exam. It is necessary for any kind of consideration but not sufficient to avoid/skip the exam.

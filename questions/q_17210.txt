This author('s)... ~ was born in Connecticut to her father (who belonged to the famous New England Beecher family, including the novelist Harriet Beecher Stowe) and her mother (whose family had lived in Rhode Island since the middle of the 17th century).  ~ father deserted their family shortly after her birth, at which point her mother moved them to Providence, Rhode Island, where she supported herself and her two children with great difficulty and was described as a mother who often withheld physical expressions of love from her children, hoping to prevent their later disillusionment over broken relationships (this author refers to her childhood as "painful" and "lonely").  ~ reluctantly married a promising Providence artist and then supported herself as a governess, art teacher, and designer of greeting cards, giving birth to their only daughter 11 months later.  ~ experienced intense despondence following the birth of their daughter and was finally persuaded by her husband and mother to travel to Philadelphia for treatment under the care of Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, the most famous neurologist of the time, who prescribed a "rest cure" (several weeks of bed rest and then limited intellectual activity) that she later described as one that drove her to "the edge of madness."  ~ left her husband (convinced that her marriage threatened her sanity) and moved to Pasadena, California, with their daughter where she was later granted a divorce; immediately following their divorce, her husband married her best friend, and not long thereafter, she sent her daughter to live with them, receiving much publicity and hostile criticism from the press. ~ continued her writing career as a journalist and writer focusing particularly on how women's economic dependency on men has stunted the growth of the entire human species, later committing suicide after being diagnosed with inoperable cancer.

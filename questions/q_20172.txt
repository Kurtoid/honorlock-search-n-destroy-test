Lipids are insoluble in water. In the above image, the test tube contains water, oil and Sudan IV, a dye.  The oil and Sudan IV aggregated at the top of the tube as shown. Oil and water will not mix.  Recall the characteristics of water that makes it a polar molecule (relates to the oxygen to hydrogen bonds in water).  Based on the aforementioned descriptions,  we can extrapolate that oil which is characterized by an abundance of carbon to hydrogen bonds is _______________ and Sudan IV is a _______________________ dye.
Considering still the elastic solid, you may generate state variables from the energy, temperature, entropy, stress and strain. Recalling that we say something is a natural function of other variables when its infinitesimal is described as a linear combination of infinitesimals of those variables, give (you don't need to name them, just give the algebraic expressions) state variables that are natural variables of i) temperature and strain, ii) temperature and stress and iii) entropy and strain. Make sure to indicate which is which.

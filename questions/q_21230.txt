In mid-September, a 3,600 sow breed-to-wean farm that you do work for had to fire the breeding department manager abruptly because of some unprofessional interactions between him and another employee. Farm management decided to hire a new graduate of the state's land-grant university, despite his inexperience. He accepted and began the job immediately, since he had been on the job market for 3 months already. It is now late November and he has his feet on the ground, knows where all the buildings are, has gotten to know the other farm workers, has learned something about company protocols, and now has some concerns about reproductive performance in the herd.    He contacts you and reports that as he now has time to take a breath and study the reproductive records, his farrowing groups coming up in December and January have projected farrowing rates that are lower than what he considers desirable. He has noticed that numbers are already dropping off in November as well.

He wants you to help him figure out what is going on and what to do. You tell him that:

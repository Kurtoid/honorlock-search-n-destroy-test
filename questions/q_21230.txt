Suppose the value of life is estimated by comparing the earnings and probabilities of death from working on a fishing boat in Alaska (very risky occupation) with the earnings and probabilities of death from working in a very safe fish processing plant in Alaska. The analysis concluded that a year of life is valued at $6 million. However, economists know that if risk seeking people take the jobs on the boats the estimate of 6 million tends to

The solutions in the two arms of this U-tube are separated by a membrane that is permeable to water, glucose, and sucrose. Side A is half-filled with a solution of 2 M sucrose and 1 M glucose. Side B is half-filled with 1 M sucrose and 2 M glucose. Initially, the liquid levels on both sides are equal.  When the system illustrated above reaches equilibrium, the sugar concentrations on both sides of the U-tube will be

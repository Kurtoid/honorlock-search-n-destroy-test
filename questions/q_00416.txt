Knowing that you had a biopsychology test later today, you started mentally going over the "fasting phase" of metabolism, which you were pretty sure was going to be on the exam (and look, it is!).  As you thought about this information, your brain cells used energy.  Describe the process of how energy was made available to your brain cells during this phase of metabolism.  In your answer, please focus only on the short-term store of energy.  If you describe aspects of the long-term store in your answer, you will lose some points.  Remember to list the primary location of this store and describe the function of all relevant molecules and hormones.  Use of bullet points and/or pictures is acceptable.

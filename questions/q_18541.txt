Example: Find the exact value of  log381{"version":"1.1","math":"log381"} Solution:log381{"version":"1.1","math":"log381"} is the exponent to which 3 must be raised to equal 81. That is 3?=81{"version":"1.1","math":"3?=81"}.          log381=y3y=813y=34y=4{"version":"1.1","math":"log381=y3y=813y=34y=4"}Therefore,  log381=4{"version":"1.1","math":"log381=4"}. Exercise: Follow the steps shown above to find the exact value of   log16913{"version":"1.1","math":"log16913"} Use the Graphical equation editor to show your work.

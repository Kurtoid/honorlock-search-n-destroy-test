You are presented with a dog that is weak in his right pelvic limb. During your examination you observe a hyperreflexic patellar reflex and increased muscle tone in the right pelvic limb. All other parts of the exam (cranial nerves, thoracic limb, etc.) are normal.  Where is this dog's lesion?
Which one of the following is the most appropriate long-term dietary management following cholecystectomy?
For the global circulation diagram below, indicate the cell, pressure belt, or wind system associated with each number (a couple numbers may have a couple different possible choices). Type out the entire name. NOTE: You will see this map for four (4) questions in a row. For each question, you only need to identify ONE (1) circulation cell, pressure belt or wind system - you do NOT need to identify them for all ten numbers. The number for which this question is asking is in RED just above the map and just below these instructions. Each is worth 0.5 points. It is designed this way so that Canvas can select four random numbers for each student, and you can still see the map for each question. You do NOT have to read these instructions again for each question; they are the same for each, so please do not waste your exam time re-reading them unless you need to.   For this question, identify a circulation cell, pressure belt, or wind system at location 2.
You should position the brand as the hero of the story:

34) A firm is considering two location alternatives. At location A, fixed costs would be $4,000,000 per year, and variable costs $0.30 per unit. At alternative B, fixed costs would be $3,600,000 per year, with variable costs of $0.35 per unit. If annual demand is expected to be 10 million units, which plant offers the lowest total cost?
The production of acetanilide(C8H9NO) involves the treatment of aniline(C6H7N) with acetic anhydride(C4H6O3).  This reaction produces an amide called acetanilide(C8H9NO) and the byproduct acetic acid (C2H4O2).  The reaction is as follows: aniline        +         acetic anhydride         --------->      acetanilide             +          acetic acid C6H7N                          C4H6O3                                      C8H9NO                               C2H4O2 molar mass C6H7N = 93.13g/mol              molar mass C4H6O3 = 102.09g/mol molar mass C8H9NO = 135.16g/mol         molar mass  C2H4O2 = 60.05g/mol Since aniline(C6H7N) is a liquid, conversion from milliliters to grams will yield the equivalence of 4.000 grams of aniline(C6H7N). Calculate the theoretical mass of acetanilide(C8H9NO) produced when the mass of aniline(C6H7N) used in the reaction equals to 4.000g. The reaction goes 100% to completion and aniline(C6H7N) is the limiting reagent. Select the best choice. (*hint: reaction balanced?)

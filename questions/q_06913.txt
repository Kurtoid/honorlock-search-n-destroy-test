A defining aspect of Spalding Gray's early life that later stimulated subject matter for his performances was:
1. One of the treatments included nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator that, when inhaled, causes pulmonary vasodilation. The ideal ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) ratio is 1. Answer the following based on ventilation-perfusion coupling. b. AFTER nitric oxide treatment, what happens to V/Q (ventilation-perfusion ratio) (INCREASE/DECREASE/NO CHANGE) when nitric oxide is inhaled AND why could this be beneficial to the patient in this case?

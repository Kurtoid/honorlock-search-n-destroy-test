The least common multiplier of two integers (LCM) is the smallest integer that both numbers will divide into exactly. For example the LCM of 12 and 30 is 60. Devise an algorithm to determine the LCM of any pair of integers. Draw a flowchart to clearly indicate the logical flow of your algorithm. You should assume the two integers are assigned at the beginning of the program and the answer is printed at the end. The flowchart need not include any function calls. Draw the flowchart by hand including the correct symbols and linkages for all the components: start, stop, statements, loops, and conditionals. After you have finished the test, first make sure upload all your .py and .txt files are uploaded. Then get your phone, scan the drawing, and upload it. You are not allowed to change ANY of your files after you take out your phone.

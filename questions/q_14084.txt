Below is a summary of a nursing study. Read the summary and then answer the factual questions that follow.  A researcher conducted an in-depth study of the experience of caring for an elderly relative.  Her focus was on the family members' lived, day-to-day experiences as a caregiver.  Ten primary caregivers of an elderly relative, recruited from the hospital where the researcher worked, participated in the study. Participants were interviewed once in their own homes within 2 weeks after the older relative was discharged from the hospital. Interviews lasted between 2 and 3 hours for each participant. All interviews, which yielded narrative, conversational data, were tape recorded and transcribed. As the researcher interviewed participants, she realized the importance of gaining the perspective of both male and female caregivers, so she sought additional male participants. Questions for the interviewing evolved from the ongoing analysis of data. Interviewing continued until the researcher began hearing the same themes repeatedly. Five major themes were identified. One theme, maintaining routines, is exemplified by the following excerpt: I had to begin to arrange my life on a regular schedule or I would not have been able to cope. I get up at 5:30 every morning.

There is so much planning that you have to do. At first, I didn't realize the importance of being well organized. But now that we have a routine, I feel much more in control and much less stressed.

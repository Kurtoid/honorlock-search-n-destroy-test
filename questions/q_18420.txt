It was the worst vacation ever!First, we flew to the island in a small plane. My wife got sick because the plane was bouncing up and down so much. Then, at our hotel, they told us that they didn't have our reservation. They put us in another room, but it was small and dirty. We asked for a different room, but they didn't have one. After that, we went to dinner at the hotel restaurant. The food was terrible, so we didn't finish our meals. The next day we took a bus tour. There was nothing to see from the bus except the trees on both sides of the road. Later that day, we learned that it only takes 55 minutes to walk around the entire island, so the bus tour was a waste of time and money.The last day wasn't so bad. We saw a lot of birds and took hundreds of photos. We also found a restaurant where the food was great. We looked for souvenirs at the one store in town, but we didn't buy anything. This was definitely not my favorite vacation!       One of the travelers felt ill because the ____________________ around too much.

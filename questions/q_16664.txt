For a 2nd order reaction, which one of the following graphs shows the correct relationship between reactant [A] (concentration of reactant A) and time?
For this question, answer it on your work paper. In the box below, type "complete" when finished. Make sure to show all of your work. At 375 degC, Kp= 0.040  for the following reaction:  3 Q (g) +   R (g)   =   2 T (g) Assume that the initial pressure of Q is 0.100 atm and R is 0.0500 atm.  Calculate the equilibrium pressures of compounds Q, R, and T.  If you use the 5% simplification you must show the work confirming the validity of the assumption. You may use your graphing calculator or this website (links to external site) to solve the  quadratic formula, but you must show all work for setting up the quadratic equation properly.

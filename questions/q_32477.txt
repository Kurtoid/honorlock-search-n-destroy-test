In an irrigation system, a tank at point B is 120' away from and 10' above the pump at Point A. Points A and B are connected by a 2" SCH 40 PVC pipe. Fittings include four 90o elbows, one check valve, one ball valve, and one gate valve for the 2" pipe. Determine the total dynamic head (TDH) pressure for the irrigation system if the flow rate is 30 GPM.   (Please include your computational steps to earn full/partial points)   TDH = suction lift + friction losses    Equivalent length of straight pipe for values and fittings (ft)

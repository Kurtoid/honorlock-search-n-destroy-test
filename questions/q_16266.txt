12)  From a paper titled "Strength of a bifurcated H bond", the authors examined different amino acid side group interactions with a peptide made of phenylalanine (Phe26), two of which are illustrated below.     The schematic below zooms in on the functional groups involved in secondary interactions between the Phenylalanine's peptide backbone amide linkage (Phe26) and the side groups of peptides made of four different amino acids (Valine, Cysteine, Threonine, Serine).  The zoomed-in FTIR region below is of the carbonyl stretching mode of the Amide 1 band which arises from the amide linkage in all the peptide backbones.  Note, the peaks won't match the wavenumbers given in the formula sheet because the authors isotopically labeled the Phe26 carbonyl group (shown as red bond) with 13C and 18O.  The hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) to the backbone N-H of the amide groups are shown in orange, while bifurcated H-bonds to side groups of the four different amino acids are shown in purple. The FTIR spectra below these illustrations show the amide I peak (from isotopically labelled C=O) of the four interacting amino acids that were tested with corresponding peak colors (if anyone is color blind, the peaks correspond in order of the illustrations from left to right).  The wavenumber shifts relative to the non-polar valine side group (shown in schematic above and below), which is labeled Val30, are marked with double-sided arrows.     Answer the following 3 questions, and include labels to indicate which part you are answering (A to C). A) Why is the amide 1 region of all of these peaks shifted to a lower wavenumber region than indicated for Amide I in the table provided in the formula sheets? B) Explain the reason for the shift and its directionality from the black Val30 curve to the brown Cys30 curve. C) Both the green Thr30 and aqua Ser30 peaks are close to each other, but greatly shifted relative to the Val30 peak.  Although you may not know anything about these amino acids, based on the chemistry illustrated, offer a viable reason as to why these peaks (Thr30 and Ser30) are more shifted than the Cys30, even though all three seem to have a similar bifurcated H-bond.

The structure of, and the developmental recombinatorial actions of, the immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain genes, ascertained in the 1970s, helped to support the clonal selection theory, first advanced in 1956.  The clonal selection theory holds that a B cell that makes the antibody that first reacts with a new, foreign antigen...

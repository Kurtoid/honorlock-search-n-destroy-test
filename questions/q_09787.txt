A 68-year-old man had nasal congestion, muscle aches, and a low-grade fever. He felt that his symptoms were resolving until he abruptly developed a shaking chill, cough, and severe pain on the right side of his chest that worsened with breathing. The cough was productive of rust-colored sputum. When he was seen in the emergency department 2 days later, he appeared acutely ill and had a temperature of 40degC. His respiratory rate was rapid at 30 breaths per minute. His white blood cell count was elevated with predominant PMNs/bands. A chest radiograph revealed a dense infiltrate in the right lung. Sputum Gram stain and culture were obtained, along with blood cultures. The offending organism was clearly identifiable in the gram stain. Appropriate antibiotics were initiated. Had this man received the recommended standard vaccines for his age, what is the most likely way that the vaccine would have prevented this illness?

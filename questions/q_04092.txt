Monitoring Workers on Social Networks As more employees use Twitter and Facebook, their supervisors are concerned with the messages they are conveying to the public. A survey found that 60 percent of executives believe they have a right to know how their employees portray themselves and their companies. On the other hand, more than half employees do not believe employers should monitor their online activity. Comparatively few companies have clear employee guidelines for the use of social networks. Some organizations have issued employee guidelines, but there's little consensus about what those rules should contain. A policy at one company states, in part, "Don't write or post anything that would embarrass the company or compromise your ability to do your job." On the other hand, an individual's personal life is separate from his or her professional life. Many competent and effective employees are rabid sports fans, frequent dance clubs, go to Star Trek conventions, or read romance novels--activities that they share on social media. Should these leisure activities be a concern of employers? 21 *  Evaluate the moral connections of employers having a say in what workers share on social networking sites.  OR A Marriage Proposal Oklahoma has the second-highest divorce rate among U.S. states. This led the governor to initiate a program to reduce divorces there. He requested that churches mandate premarital counseling. In addition, Oklahoma funded "relationship skills" education for welfare recipients, pro-marriage rallies led by hired "marriage ambassadors," and prenuptial counseling classes for couples who could not afford private counseling. President George W. Bush liked   the Oklahoma programs and presented a plan to spend $300 million to promote marriage. According to Bush, "Strong marriages and stable families are incredibly good for children, and stable families should be the central goal of American welfare policy." His proposal called for premarital education, relationship counseling, and publicity to convince high-risk groups that "marriage is cool." Critics call the Oklahoma and Bush plans a "conservative version of big-government social engineering." They also raise questions about the proper role of government in the private lives of its citizens. At the same time, however, states spend millions of dollars on services such as child support enforcement, child abuse response, and divorced persons driven to welfare because of financial problems. It is argued that some government-funded pro-marriage programs ultimately could reduce the human and social costs brought about by failed marriages.19 *  Was President Bush violating his power of a mandatory pro-marriage program.

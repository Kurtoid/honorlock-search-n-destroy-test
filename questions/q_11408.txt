Attorneys A and B both practice patent law in the same 40-person firm. A is approached by CompuCo, a large corporation that sought to file a lawsuit against TechCo for infringement of a patent. A informed CompuCo that he would look at the matter but that the corporation should not disclose any more information than was necessary for A to determine whether he could take the case. A took reasonable measures to avoid exposure to more disqualifying information that was reasonably necessary for A to determine whether to take the case, but A did receive material damaging information from CompuCo. Attorney A did not accept the representation of CompuCo because he thought that TechCo would prevail in this litigation.  CompuCo found another law firm to sue TechCo and TechCo approached B to represent it in the defense of this patent infringement case. B immediately screened A from the information relating to the TechCo representation and from all profits that may come in from the case. B also informed CompuCo in writing promptly that he was screening A from the potential and actual representation of TechCo. CompuCo immediately objected and filed a motion to disqualify.  Will CompuCo prevail under the Model Rules?

There are two options below; tackle only one of them.  Remember that the quote is there to stir up your thinking, maybe to provide you with a bit of grist for your intellectual mill. You will receive little to no credit if all you do is analyze the quote. As the question itself (in italics) indicates, we want to see an actual argument based on evidence you bring in from across the spectrum of material we've examined: in Homer, in Roisman, in lectures, in the presentations of fellow students, etc. Option A     "In Homer's day, the ruins of what had once been the well-built walls of Troy, on their commanding site overlooking the Hellespont, as the Dardanelle Straits were then known, were visible to any traveler; the Iliad's close description of the Troad, the region around Troy, suggests that it was known to its poet at first hand.  The war, then, was real, not mythic, to Homer and to his audience.  Similarly, the major Greek principalities named by the Iliad as participating in the war also existed.  Their ruins, too, were visible to any traveler.    "Knowledge of Troy and Troy's time has been advanced by archaeology.  The Trojan War itself, however, the terrible conflagration that unmoored whole nations, remains mysterious."                --Caroline Alexander, The War that Killed Achilles Homer's treatment of both his own contemporary moment as well as the Mycenaean epoch has been subjected to many analyses, and we have visited more than a few of these efforts to get at either the "real" Trojan War, or instead the "understood" version of the war.  With an eye on both supporting and contradictory evidence--the kind drawn from contending scholars as well as what you found while reading the poem--what arguments would you advance in support of the Iliad as a historical source?     Option B     "The hoplites' courage was therefore not the result of a strictly military discipline--nor, as we have seen, was it the result of a warrior frenzy leaving no place of fear (as is demonstrated by their readiness to admit defeat).  Aiming above all to ensure the cohesion of the phalanx, their courage was based upon a well-understood solidarity: it consisted of not abandoning one's comrades in arms and, therefore, of remaining steady in one's position.  Consequently, an esprit de corps was systematically cultivated."                        -Yvon Garlan, "War and Peace" in The Greeks Although there is the possibility of seeing group tactics in the Iliad, the full switch (politically, militarily, and socially) came in the course of the Archaic Period, perhaps at the moment-or soon after-Homer preserved the oral traditions.  From the evidence, primary and secondary, that we have read and discussed, how do see this issue of solidarity playing out in the themes of the Iliad, and then historically, across poleis like Athens and Sparta? In their constant worry over stasis or the victory of tyrants? Or the resistance to external threats, like Persia?

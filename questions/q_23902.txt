Humanism is an outlook or system of thought attaching prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters. Humanist beliefs stress the potential value and goodness of human beings, emphasize common human needs, and seek solely rational ways of solving human problems.

Thus, how is the development of prejudice in each poem the opposite of humanism and the ideas in which our nation was founded?  Make a claim and develop in a 2-3 paragraph response. Use evidence from each poem to support your claim and cite in MLA format.

Manchmal, wie auch heute, treffen sie Elke und Franziska. Alle vier sind Schulfreunde. Harald schlagt vor, dass sie zum Eiscafe Roma gehen sollen. Aber Manfred hat eine andere Idee. Er meint, es kostet dort zu viel und schlagt vor, dass sie doch lieber einen Film im Regina-Palast sehen sollen. Das finden auch alle gut. Dort lauft jetzt ein amerikanischer Film vom Wilden Westen. Er lauft schon zwei Wochen. Der Film fangt um halb sechs an. Deshalb haben sie noch etwas Zeit. Franziska hat Hunger und sagt ihren Schulfreunden, dass sie vor dem Film noch etwas essen mochte. Das meinen die anderen auch. Gleich um die Ecke vom Kino gibt es einen Imbiss. Dort essen sie Bratwurst und Hamburger und trinken Cola. Jetzt wird es langsam Zeit. Sie machen jetzt schnell. Der Film beginnt in zehn Minuten. Also, los!   Ein Madchen sagt, dass sie etwas essen mochte.

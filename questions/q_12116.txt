Forty percent of these unit sales of the new model is expected to come from other models already being manufactured by Drone Concepts (10 percent from Model D1, 30 percent from Model D2, 40 percent from Model D3, and 20 percent from Model D4). Drone Concepts will incur a fixed cost of $550,000 to add the new model to the line. Based on the preceding data, should DCI add the new Model D5 to its line of drones? Why or why not?

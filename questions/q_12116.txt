An object with mass m is forced to go around a curve of radius R with a constant velocity vo. The body is acted by the Net Force (FNET o). If now the velocity is quadrupled, then the new Net force (FNET f) acting on the body (in terms of the initial FNET o) is, Hint: it's asked # (FNET f = # FNET o)

A CUDA kernel processes an mxn image where m is the vertical or y direction and n is the x or horizontal direction.  Suppose that m=799 and n=600 and we decide to use a grid of 16x16 thread blocks for the calculation with one thread per pixel.  How many warps will experience control divergence?   __global__ void PictureKernel(float* d_Pin, float* d_Pout, int n, int m) {    // Calculate the row # of the d_Pin and d_Pout element to process    int Row = blockIdx.y*blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;    // Calculate the column # of the d_Pin and d_Pout element to process    int Col = blockIdx.x*blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;    // each thread computes one element of d_Pout if in range    if ((Row < m) && (Col < n)) {        d_Pout[Row*n+Col] = 2*d_Pin[Row*n+Col];    }}

5 kg of air contained in a rigid tank is initially at 30oC and 180 kPa.  A 25 W electric heater inside the tank is then turned on for 1.5 hours to heat up the air, during which time 40 kJ of heat is lost to the surroundings.   Using the ideal gas model and assuming a constant specific heat cv = 0.72 kJ/(kg*K), determine:  the final temperature of the air, in oC; the final pressure of the air, in kPa; the entropy change of the air, in kJ/K.  Please do NOT type.  Please write your detailed solutions on the exam paper.  Thank you.

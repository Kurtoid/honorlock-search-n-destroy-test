From the Baltic, south, those barriers cut across Germany in a gash of barbed wire, concrete, dog runs, and guard towers. . . . In the 1950s, Khrushchev predicted: "We will bury you." But in the West today, we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well-being unprecedented in all human history. In the Communist world, we see failure, technological backwardness, declining standards of health, even want of the most basic kind--too little food. Even today, the Soviet Union still cannot feed itself. After these four decades, then, there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion: Freedom leads to prosperity.

In the logistic population growth model, the per capita rate of population increase approaches zero as the population size (N) approaches the carrying capacity (K), as shown in the table. Assume that rmax = 1.0 and K = 1,500. You can then calculate the population growth rate for four cases where population size (N) is greater than carrying capacity. To do this, use the equation for population growth rate in the table.    Which of these four populations where the population size (N) is greater than the carrying capacity has the highest growth rate?

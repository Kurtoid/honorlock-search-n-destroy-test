Suppose the SHADED portion denotes all programs that do NOT contain divide-by-zero errors, and the UNSHADED portion within the black rectangle denotes all programs that DO contain such errors. Let A1, A2, and A3 be different program analyses which check for divide-by-zero errors. Each analysis either ACCEPTS (i.e. declares it free of divide-by-zero errors) or REJECTS (i.e. declares that at least one divide-by-zero error exists in) a given program. For each analysis, the programs accepted by that analysis are contained INSIDE the corresponding oval, and the programs rejected by that analysis are contained OUTSIDE the corresponding oval. Assume usual notions of soundness and completeness for program analysis.   For each analysis (A1, A2, A3), state whether it is sound, complete, both, or neither.    Analysis Sound? Complete?   A1 [A1sound] [A1complete]   A2 [A2sound] [A2complete]   A3 [A3sound] [A3complete]

I have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him scream out so insanely-a horror which, I feel sadly sure, is mainly responsible for his present breakdown. We had snatches of shouted conversation above the wind's piping and the engine's buzzing as we reached the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the camp, but that had mostly to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare city. Certain things, we had agreed, were not for people to know and discuss lightly-and I would not speak of them now but for the need of heading off that Starkweather-Moore Expedition, and others, at any cost. It is absolutely necessary, for the peace and safety of mankind, that some of earth's dark, dead corners and unplumbed depths be let alone; lest sleeping abnormalities wake to resurgent life, and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash out of their black lairs to newer and wider conquests.   All that Danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a mirage. It was not, he declares, anything connected with the cubes and caves of those echoing, vaporous, wormily-honeycombed mountains of madness which we crossed; but a single fantastic, demoniac glimpse, among the churning zenith clouds, of what lay back of those other violet westward mountains which the Old Ones had shunned and feared. It is very probable that the thing was a sheer delusion born of the previous stresses  . . .  He has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things about "The black pit," "the carven rim," "the protoShoggoths," "the windowless solids with five dimensions," "the nameless cylinder," "the elder Pharos," "Yog-Sothoth," "the primal white jelly," "the color out of space," "the wings," "the eyes in darkness," "the moon-ladder," "the original, the eternal, the undying," and other bizarre conceptions; but when he is fully himself he repudiates all this and attributes it to his curious and macabre reading of earlier years.

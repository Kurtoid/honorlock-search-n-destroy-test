The theorist Eric Berne theorized that an individual's three ego states of parent, child, and adult make up one's:
There is a familiar America.  It is celebrated in speeches and advertised on television and in the magazines.  I has the highest mass standard of living the world has ever known.  In the 1950s, this America worried about itself, yet even its anxieties were products of abundance.  The title of a brilliant book [John Kenneth Galbraith's The Affluent Society] was widely misinterpreted, and the familiar America began to call itself "the affluent society."  There was introspection about Madison Avenue and tail fins [on a car]; there was a discussion of the emotional suffering taking place in the suburbs. In all this, there was an implicit assumption that the basic grinding economic problems were no longer a matter of basic human needs, of food, shelter, and clothing.  Now they were seen as qualitative, a question of learning to live decently amid luxury. While this discussion was carried on, there existed another America.  In it dwelt somewhere between 40,000,000 and 50,000,000 citizens of this land.  They were poor.  They still are.   To be sure, the other America is not impoverished in the same sense as those poor nations where millions cling to hunger as a defense against starvation.  This country has escaped such extremes.  That does not change the fact that tens of millions of Americans are, at this very moment, maimed in body and spirit, existing at levels beneath those necessary for human decency.  If these people are not starving, they are hungry, and sometimes fat with hunger, for that is what cheap foods do.  They are without adequate housing and education and medical care.  The Government has documented what this means to the bodies of the poor, and the figures will be cited throughout this book.  But even more basic, this poverty twists and deforms the spirit.  The American poor are pessimistic and defeated, and they are victimized by mental suffering to a degree unknown in Suburbia.  This book is a description of the world in which these people live; it is about the other America.  Here are the unskilled workers, the migrant farm workers, the aged, the minorities, and all the others who live in the economic underworld of American life.  In all this, there will be statistics, and that offers the opportunity for disagreement among honest and sincere men.  I would ask the reader to respond critically to every assertion, but not to allow statistical quibbling to obscure the huge, enormous, and intolerable fact of poverty in America.  For, when all is said and done, that fact is unmistakable, whatever its exact dimensions, and the truly human reaction can only be outrage. . . .  There are perennial reasons that made the other America an invisible land.  Poverty is often the beaten track.  It always has been. The ordinary tourist never left the main highway, and today he rides interstate turnpikes.  He does not go into the valleys of Pennsylvania where the towns look like the movie sets of Wales in the thirties.  He does not see the company houses in rows, the rutted roads (the poor always have bad roads whether they live in the city, in towns, or on farms), and everything is black and dirty.  And even if he were to pass through such a place by accident, the tourist would not meet the unemployed men in the bar or the women coming home from a runaway sweatshop. ~~Michael Harrington, The Other America: Poverty in the United States (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1962), 9-11.     According to the passage, which of the following BEST explains why there aren't more people involved helping the impoverished?

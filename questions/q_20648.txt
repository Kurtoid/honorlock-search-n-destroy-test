Introduction to Statistics - Test 3 Show working please    State the Central Limit Theorem.                                        Suppose x has a distribution with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 3. Random samples of size n=36 are drawn. What is the mean and standard error of the sampling distribution of  the  sample mean.                     Assume that women's heights are normally distributed with mean 5'3"and            standard deviation 3".  What is the probability that a random sample of 16          women has an average height greater than 5'6" ?                                    What are the conditions for the normal distribution to be used as an            approximation to the binomial distribution ? What is the mean and            standard deviation of the approximating normal distribution?                                  Suppose we have a binomial experiment with n=40 trials and probability of      success p=0.85. Estimate Prob( r

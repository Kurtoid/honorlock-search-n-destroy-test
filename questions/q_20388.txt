Basic Requirements (8 pts) Create an iOS application called Flagler CIS Curriculum which displays the CIS courses information to prospective students. 1) In the first CISMainViewController scene, create a PickerView (hint: make sure to set the DataSource and Delegate to the corresponding view controller) to show two categories of courses (Core CIS Courses and Elective IS Courses). 2) When a student selects a category and tabs on the View Courses button, the next CourseListViewController scene shows the course listing under that category using a text label. Please use only ONE CourseListViewController to show the course listings based on the user selection (hint: use if statement). The navigation title should be displayed properly as well.  Bonus Features (5 pts, 10% of the exam): 1) In the second screen, instead of using text labels, use a UITableView control to list the courses. Note: If you choose this feature, you don't need to create text labels for the course list as required above. 2) In the first screen, add one additional text field called Core Hours Completed. Then in the second screen, compute Core Hours Needed based on 30 core hours needed for the CIS major.  App Requirements:  Use proper naming convention for the Swift codes used in your program. Create UI elements accordingly, such as PickerView, UIButton, UITableView, text box, etc. Implement appropriate business logic to display the information. Use Navigation Controller, View Controller and Segue properly. Create custom classes to control the view controllers. You may reuse codes from previous projects and conduct research online and use any reference books for this mini project.  Zip the ENTIRE PROJECT FOLDER attach the zip file to this question. Please make sure to double check your submission. Wrong file submission without the correct project files will cause you to lose all points. NO LATE SUBMISSION OR RESUBMISSION IS ALLOWED FOR THE FINAL EXAM. You will only earn points based on the file you submitted to this exam.

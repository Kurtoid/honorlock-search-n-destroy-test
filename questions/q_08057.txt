Which theory of contextual interference argues that random practice forces the person to abandon and then reassemble a skill?
All of the following, EXCEPT, are characteristic of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.
Back up cheat sheet (in case you are unable to access the google doc).   Productivity is the power to use known words to share ideas with others, and to make new words. Productivity can be used with both words and with the moving of the body.  Productivity can mean the use of hands to show what a person is thinking or feeling. Displacement is when words are used to talk about something that is not present somewhere else in place or time. Displacement warns others about a possible problem if someone does not make the moves to take care of it. Minimal Pairs are words that are only different because of one sound, which makes them have different meanings. This shows that the change between the sounds is important. Allophones are sounds that are a little different from one another whose sound may change because of where they are in a word, but you don't notice the change (you think they're the same sound). People with Broca's aphasia have a hard time talking or forming words. They cannot tell others what they think about. However, they can still understand words. Broca's aphasia is caused by several reasons such as pain to the front-left side of the brain. People with Wernicke's aphasia have a hard time understanding words. However, they can still form words. Yet, nothing they say makes sense or sounds right. Wernicke's aphasia can be caused by pain to the left-back side of the brain.  Phonotactic Constraints are the ways we can and can't put sounds together in the words that we use. This is like how /b/ can be followed by some sounds (such /o/ in "bored" or /r/ in "brother"), but not others (like /t/, as "bt----" doesn't work). Transitional Probabilities are how much we can expect one sound to follow another. Having a feeling of what sounds are used more after other sounds helps us learn how to talk because we know what sounds we can put together to make words. Once you know how to make words and what they mean, you can put them together to make a new idea. Through compositionality, there are some ways we tend to put words together that give them a guess-able meaning we can figure out, so you can learn the meaning of a word by using the other words around it in the whole thought. Semantic priming is when you hear or read a word and you turn on other words in your brain that have meanings close to the first. This is done without you knowing or thinking about it. This makes the words with meanings close to the first word quicker to understand when you see or hear them later. Mutual Exclusivity is something that helps us learn words for things. When you see two things and know the word for one of them, if you hear a word you don't know, you may learn to use it for the object you don't know. Whole Object Bias is when you think a word means the whole of a thing instead of a part--this means a baby will learn the word "cat" easier than "eyes", because the first is a whole object, and the second is a part. McGurk Effect happens when you hear a sound, but see someone say a different sound. When you are hearing a sound, but seeing a different sound being said, your brain hears the sound as a completely different third different sound. This happens because your brain is confused by seeing and hearing two different sounds, so it "hears" a completely different sound in order to make sense of the situation. Phoneme Restoration Effect is when there is a missing sound in something we hear, and our brain makes us think we heard the sound that was missing. This still happens even when the missing sound has noise in its place. Our brains do this so what we hear makes sense.  Syntactic Priming is when people are speaking and they use one form of word order to explain their thoughts and then when talking about a different thought, that form comes to mind. People do this because when you use a form, it becomes easy to think of, so it is easy for them to explain the following thought in that same way.  Lexical Bias is why when people are speaking but they say a word wrong, more often, the mess up word is a different real word, than a non-word. When you hear someone say something, you make something in your mind that looks like what they're talking about. These are mental models, and change how easily you can think of things. If a word was said in the person's speaking but wasn't model you made of it, it's harder to think of the word than if it was. When someone says words, they have a "big idea" that isn't just the way they happened to be put together. This meaning (in our minds) is a proposition, so a single proposition can be meant by different sets of words. The proposition is the idea of what had to have happened for the words said by the person speaking to be true. N400: This wave has a very low point [see note by Dr. K, below]. It occurs when a word's meaning doesn't really make sense because of the meanings of words around it. "The teacher talked to the person with her foot" The word "foot" may cause an N400.  P600: This wave has a very high point. It occurs when a word isn't correct within several words. "The crazy child throw the little train on the floor." "Throw" is the right word but isn't used in the right way ("threw") and may cause a P600.  Note by Dr. K: The words "high" and "low" point are about P = positive change and N = negative change; BUT graphs flip "high" and "low". A line that goes up is negative, and that goes down is positive.

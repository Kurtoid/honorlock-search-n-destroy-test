Answer one (1) only of the following. Support your interpretations with specific and relevant evidence from our readings and lectures (40%). A.  1918:  "...the government established a secret a secret task force, headquartered in the New York Public Library and code-named The Inquiry.  More than 100 scholars were enlisted in the group, leaders in fields as divers as engineering, Egyptology, and Native American cultures. None of them, however, were specialists on the Middle East.  Rather, The Inquiry's 'experts' consulted encyclopedias, travel books, and missionary manuals--everything but Arabic and Turkish texts--in formulating their plans for the region. ... The Inquiry's recommendations for the Middle East were assembled in a report, 'Just and Practical Boundaries for the Turkish Empire,' in November 1918, the month the armistice was signed.  Wilson, though, ,chose not to share them with his Allies..."       --Michael B. Oren, Power, Faith, and Fantasy Despite the brief attention to the events of WWI by our textbook authors, our course gave that war--and its aftermath--much attention as the primary pivot that left us much of what is today's modern Middle East.  It is, as you know, a story of big dreams colliding with realpolitik, of superpowers fading and new ones arriving, all while the local peoples sought a way to establish some kind of control over their own fates. In a 2001 article, Edward Said described this "disorderly reality" as a "Clash of Ignorance." Using evidence across the twentieth century, how would you substantiate or counter such a claim? B.  "The Islamist who wants to run his own country has a clear idea of the obstacles that are likely to be placed in front of him.  The military power of the secular state, in league with its Western allies, is the most formidable...The political disunity of the umma has been recognized... So, the Islamist turns to his own country and hopes to reform it by using political pressure.  When this fails, he becomes frustrated.  The consequences are multifarious."       --Mark Huband, Warriors of the Prophet With reference to all that we've studied-via lectures and the textbooks-how would you assess this argument?  Do the histories of various nation-states, or of various Islamist movements, of modernization vs. traditionalism, support or undermine Huband's contention?

On the International Space Station an object with mass  is attached to a massless string of length [R] m. The string can handle a tension of [T] N before breaking. The object undergoes uniform circular motion, being spun around by the string horizontally. The object is spun more and more rapidly until the string snaps. If the velocity of the object was [v] m/s when the string broke, what is the mass of the object? Give your answer in kilograms.

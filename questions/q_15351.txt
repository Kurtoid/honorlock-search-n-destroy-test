Boolean Expressions Decision-making on computers are based on statements called boolean expressions.  This can be particularly useful when used to compare the properties of two sprites. For example, you could figure out which one is larger or placed higher up. In the next few puzzles we'll use simple boolean expressions to compare sprite properties. Predict Read the code below. There are some new symbols in it which you haven't been introduced to. Take a guess at what they mean and try to answer the following question.  var sprite1 = createSprite(100, 200);var sprite2 = createSprite(300, 200); // Predict what each command will printconsole.log(sprite1.y == sprite2.y);console.log(sprite1.x > sprite2.x);console.log(sprite1.x < sprite2.y); drawSprites();     Which result will be printed in the console by this program?   a.  true, false, true   b. 0 , 200, 100   c. true, error, true   d. false, true, false

Be sure to label each with the appropriate letter.  Write an InvalidShelfLifeException exception class which contains only a parameterized constructor. An exception of this type should be checked. An object of this type is created when the user provides data for shelfLife that is invalid (shelfLife cannot be negative nor greater than 7). (6 pts) Write the body of the parameterized constructor for the BakeryItem class. An InvalidShelfLifeException should be thrown if the shelf life passed to the method is invalid. Are you required to include a throws clause at the end of the method header? Why or why not? (8 pts) Write application code that instantiates a BakeryItem object. Be sure to handle the exception that can be thrown and to declare any necessary variables. (4 pts) Is the toString method in the BakeryItem class and example of overloading or overriding? Explain your answer (2 pts) Is the parameterized constructor in the BakeryItem class and example of overloading or overriding? Explain your answer (2 pts)

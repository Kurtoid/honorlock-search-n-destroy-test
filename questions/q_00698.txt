Suppose you work at AMD and have a CPU which executes a program consisting of 50% floating point divide with average CPI = 10, 30% floating point multiply with average CPI = 6, and the remaining 20% are from other instructions with average CPI = 2. Your boss wants a new version of the CPU to run 2 times faster. You can make the divide run at most 5 times faster and the multiply run at most 6 times faster. Can you meet our boss's goal by making only one improvement (and which one), or both, or is it not possible? (Hint: the number of instructions for the program will remain the same across the two CPUs)

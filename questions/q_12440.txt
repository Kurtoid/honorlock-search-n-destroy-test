A 1-m x 1-m isothermal top surface of an industrial incinerator is held at a temperature of 390 K.  Air flows over the top surface of the plate at a velocity of 25 m/s, aligned with this surface, at a temperature of 310 K and atmospheric pressure.  The vibration caused by the internal mechanisms cause the boundary layer flow to be turbulent right from the leading edge.    (a)        Calculate the heat loss from this flat surface. (b)        Calculate the air velocity that would be required to increase the heat loss by 20% if all other conditions remain unchanged.

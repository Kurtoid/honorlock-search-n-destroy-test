T. T. Wu derived a relationship between cotransduction frequency and map distances obtained from conjugation experiments Cotransduction frequency = (1 - d/L)3      where  d = distance between two genes in minutes                 L = the size of the transduced DNA (in minutes)  For P1 transduction, this size is ~ 2% of the E. coli               chromosome, which equals about 2 minutes           If the cotransduction frequency of supD  is 0.25 then, what is the distance between supD  and another gene eda in the the DNA fragment that was transferred to the recipient.

Below is a metabolic pathway having 3 chemical reactions and 3 enzymes. Enzyme 1 (E1) has 2 binding sites--1 for the substrate A and another for the end product D. As the pathway proceeds, the end product in higher quantities will react with enzyme 1, blocking the enzyme's binding to the substrate. Which statement is true about this pathway?                      E1        E2         E3         Substrate A ----> B ----> C ----> D end product

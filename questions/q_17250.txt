Example: Given the functions f(x)=x2+1{"version":"1.1","math":"f(x)=x2+1"}  and  g(x)=x-3{"version":"1.1","math":"g(x)=x-3"}, find(f[?]g)(x){"version":"1.1","math":"(f[?]g)(x)"}. Solution:               (f[?]g)(x)=f(g(x))             =(x-3)2+1             =x2-6x+9+1{"version":"1.1","math":"(f[?]g)(x)=f(g(x))             =(x-3)2+1             =x2-6x+9+1"} Answer:  (f[?]g)(x)=x2-6x+10{"version":"1.1","math":"(f[?]g)(x)=x2-6x+10"} Exercise: Given the functions f(x)=x2+1{"version":"1.1","math":"f(x)=x2+1"}  and  g(x)=x-3{"version":"1.1","math":"g(x)=x-3"}, find  (g[?]f)(x){"version":"1.1","math":"(g[?]f)(x)"}.

1.   The first few questions have to do PRIMARILY with the CFA model that is required before estimating the model above. Please answer the following questions. a.    Nick understands that degree of freedom is a useful tool in verifying whether the model is estimated as originally specified. If he estimates the associated CFA model AND structural model above, what would be the degrees of freedom in the output both?  Make sure you show and/or describe your work/reasoning. (10 points) b.    Please list and explain the reasons why it is better to test this model with SEM than with OLS regression based on our readings in class. (10 points) c.    Nick estimated its measurement model first and the output is attached at the end. Using the Fornell and Larcker (1981) method, please assess the construct validity and reliability of all three constructs. You are allowed to use Excel. Please submit your Excel files along with your answers. (20 points) d.    As a result of the assessment on the initial output, Nick decided to drop the item, SysInn3. Please help Nick justify his decision briefly and provide citations to support the decision. Should Nick check anything else in doing so? Please be specific. (10 points) e.    After SysInn3 dropped off, Nick is concerned about whether the model is identified. Please evaluate whether the model is identified using the Rank Rule (Reilly, 1995) and at least one more rule.

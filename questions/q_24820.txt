There are two questions related to the description below. This is question 2 of 2.  Janelle is a microbiologist at the CDC studying the pathogenicity of Clostridioides difficile, the bacterium responsible for sepsis. She compared the sequences of gene NTA587 between a normal strain of C. difficile and an antibiotic resistant strain, and found two nucleotides differences between them.  The mRNA transcribed from each bacteria's genome is below. You can see the nucleotide differences in the context of the codons that they are part of. Use the codon chart provided to determine whether either of the mutations result in changes to the amino acid sequence. QUESTION: What do you conclude about the consequences of each mutation?

A plane structure shown consists of rigid weightless bar and linear springs of stiffness k1 and k2.  Only small VERTICAL displacements are permitted.  Using the direct method, determine the stiffness-matrix, [K], for the following choice of degrees-of-freedom:      DOF-1:     DOF-2:      What is size of the stiffness matrix of the structure and why (5 Points) Using the direct stiffness method calculate the stiffness matrix that operates on the two-d.o.f. VA, V2 shown.  (20 Points)
A block of solid aluminum with height h, length l, and width w has a resistivity of 2.7x10-8 O*m. An electric current is flowing through it from right to left. h = 0.05 m l = 1.2 m w = 0.04 m    Make a sketch of the block indicating each dimension h, l, and w, and add an arrow showing the direction of current through the block. [1] What is the resistance of the block? [3]
Karl works at Moe's grocery. This year Karl was paid $43,000 in salary but he was also in debt to Moe's for a loan Moe's gave him when Karl started his employment. This year, in appreciation for Karl's tenth anniversary of service, Moe's gave Karl an engraved silver goblet with his name and "In appreciation of 10 years of service" on it. The goblet was worth $350. Moe's also forgave the balance of Karl's debt in the amount of $4,500. What amount must Karl include in his gross income related to the events above?

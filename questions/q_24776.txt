You may use HonorLock, the online proctoring service.  HonorLock proctoring service will record a video of you taking the exam.  It will be reviewed by a proctor and then sent to the instructor for review.  The proctor will note any behaviors that may indicate academic dishonesty.  In other words, any behavior that indicates that the student might have had some type of assistance with answering questions on the exam.   The instructor will review the video as well.     There is a zero tolerance policy for academic dishonesty.

This must be a small room with door(s) like a bedroom; it cannot be a room with multiple open doorways such as a living room or library. The room scan video must include a clear and thorough recording of your hands, the desktop, keyboard, under the desk, and the surrounding floors, room, and walls. You must look at the computer screen the entire length of the exam. Do not open other browsers, windows, or documents while you are taking the exam. You may not have or use any type of assistance with the exam. No hoods, stocking caps, blankets, or other item covering the ear area. No electronic devices can be present or utilized in the work area. This includes: smartwatches, ear buds/pods, headphones, tablets, MP3 players, tape recorders, phones, TVs, etc. No books, notes, scrap paper, pens, purses, backpacks, clothes, caps, hats, etc. are allowed at your work area.

I also understand that a violation of any of these terms may result in a grade of "0" zero on the exam.

Here are the main points for an informative speech about the history of the @ symbol. I. The first recorded use of the @ symbol was in 1536 to represent units of wine. II. In later centuries, the @ symbol was used to mean "at the rate of" or "at the cost of." III. Today's @ symbol came into use in 1971 in the first e-mail ever sent. These main points are arranged in __________ order.

The causes and consequences of global poverty are similar due to the cyclical nature of poverty. Common consequences include
Glucose and glucose-6-phosphate (Glucose-6-P) do not move across artificial membranes (made of phospholipids but lacking proteins). To further your understanding of cell membrane functions, you conducted an experiment on the transport of glucose and glucose-6-P into living muscle cells. At the start of the experiment, the concentration of both kinds of molecules outside the cells was 1.0 Molar (M). The original concentration of each molecule inside the cells was 0.1 M. (column labeled 0 hr). After 2 hours, the concentration of each molecule inside the cells was measured (column labeled 2 hr). As a follow-up, you add cyanide at this point (2 hr after start time) to the cells in the continuing experiment. This stops all ATP production inside the cells. Two hours later (4 hours total), you again determine the level of the test molecules inside the cells (column labeled +2 hr +Cyanide). Muscle Cells Intracellular Concentrations:     Time   0 hr   2 hr   +2 hr +Cyanide     Glucose   0.1M   0.5M   1.0M     Glucose-6-P   0.1M   0.1M   0.1M      Is glucose being transported into the muscle cells? If that is the case, through which process does uptake take place? Write the number of your choice and explain your reasoning in the text box.  No, it is not being transported into the cells Yes, it is being transported by simple diffusion Yes, it is being transported by facilitated diffusion Yes, it is being transported by active transport There is not enough information to determine the type of process
The various forms of cobalamin cannot be interconverted. As a result, the active coenzyme forms of cobalamin must be consumed directly in the diet.

The client is prescribed cyclobenzaprine. In evaluating the client for the desired outcome of this medication, what would the nurse assess?
Your client has an order for Dopamine IV to infuse at {x} mcg/kg/min.  Your patient's weight is 251 lbs and the concentration of the Dopamine bag is 800 mg in 250 ml of 0.9% Normal Saline.  How many ml/hr will you set the pump?  Record your answer using 1 decimal place(s). Enter only a number in the blank.

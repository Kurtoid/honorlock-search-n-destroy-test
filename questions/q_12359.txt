Stress and depression can cause cellular changes (neuron death, loss of synapses, loss of dendrites) in the brain, and there is some evidence that anti-depressants like imipramine (which increases serotonin and norepinephrine synaptic levels) can reverse cellular damage.  In the case of PTSD, however, while depression symptoms such as memory and concentration can be reversed with the treatment, exaggerated fear is not easily reversed.  b. Name one brain region associated with stress and fear.  Antidepressant treatment can help with these symptoms, but permanent reversal of cellular damage does not occur.  Patients with retractable PTSD often do respond to either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT, cognitive training that focuses realistic and positive scenarios ) OR exposure therapy (like the virtual reality (VR) therapy we saw in PSS).  Choose EITHER CBT or VR exposure therapy and present a hypothesis for how it can work at the cellular level to reverse the stress and fear of PTSD. 8 pts, no images, 100 word limit

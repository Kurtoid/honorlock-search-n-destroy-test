Refer to the image above.  Name the connective tissue layer "B."
A locus in mice is involved in pigment production: when parents heterozygous at this locus are mated, 3/4 of the progeny are colored and 1/4 are albino.  Another locus controls the actual coat color: When two yellow mice are mated 2/3 of the progeny are yellow and 1/3 are agouti (gray).   A Yellow male mouse is crossed with an Albino female mouse.  After a large number of progeny are produced the observed ratios in the progeny are:  Progeny:         1/2  albino  :  1/3 yellow  :  1/6 agouti Based on this information (and using standard genetic symbols - Capital for Dominant, Lowercase for Recessive) , the most probable Genotype of the Agouti female parent was [LL1]. And the most probable Genotype of the Yellow progeny was [LL2].

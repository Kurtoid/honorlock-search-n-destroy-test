The potential energy function for a system of particles is given by U(x) = -3x3 + 7x2 + 3x, where x is the position of one particle in the system. Answer the following questions. A) Find the force, F(x) on the particle as a function of x. B) Find the values of x for which the force equal to zero. C) What is the stable equilibrium value of x? (for this part you need to plot U(x) vs. x and F(x) vs. x  on your paper and upload with other solutions. Indicate the values of x that correspond to the points of stable and unstable equilibrium on the graphs)

Your annual bonus is calculated as 15% of the new revenue you produce each year. You want to buy a house by year end and set a goal to receive a bonus of $50,000 for the down payment and closing costs. In setting your goals for the year, you want to know what your key activities should be. Your average sale is $1500. Approximately 3 out of every 5 prospects you meet with twice will buy from you. Approximately 4 out of every 5 prospects you meet with once will agree to a second meeting. On the phones, 3 out of every 10 prospecting phone conversations will agree to meet with you a first time. Your screening process is still unproven and you have calculated that for internet inquiries (leads) you receive, 80% will give you a good phone number and of those, half will answer and talk with you. How many internet leads do you need to make  the bonus you want to make?

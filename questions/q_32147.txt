BONUS) You are marooned on a distant planet with strange (non-human) creatures who do not understand your language. (They think the sounds you make are nothing more than grunts.)  They see you as a dangerous animal.  Unless you can prove that you have intelligence, they will surely eat you. The leader of this group offers you a piece of paper and a pencil-like writing instrument.  On this paper you see symbols, which you determine are numbers.  But there is a problem--what number system do they use (i.e., what base, e.g., 10, 2, 8, 16, etc.)?  Since they each have 19 fingers on their upper hand and 18 fingers on their lower hand, you guess it might be base 37. Save your life by solving the below problems (one addition and one subtraction) with the aid of the given table.  You must show all work, i.e., carries and borrows! Use your scratch paper and label this BONUS. Note: Zero is represented as O and is the third character STOP and the second character in COVID!; the letter O is the last character in PLDO. Be very careful to copy they characters properly.

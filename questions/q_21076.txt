Transcription is a complex process that is regulated by a number of proteins and genetic elements.  Often there are genetic elements located upstream of the gene and in some instances on different chromosomes that regulate whether a gene is on or off.  In some instances, these elements can also regulate the rate of transcription.  These genetic elements are commonly referred to as:

The production of paper requires large amounts of water and Auburn Paper needs to invest in a new waste water treatment process to bring the company into compliance with the state's bylaws.  Specifically, the firm is considering two mutually exclusive investments, which will be repeated for the foreseeable future.  The appropriate discount rate for this project is 10 percent.  Option 1 costs $500 today and costs an additional $200 each year for two years.  Option 2 costs $250 today and costs an additional $300 each year for three years.  Which should you choose and why? what is EAA for your choice?
Match the correct epithelial membrane with where they are located.
Name 2 specific PAMPs (Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns) that are ligands for immune system receptors.
For a peptide whose sequence spells the word CAR, answer the following questions given the pKa values below.  Cysteine (C): 1.7 (a-COOH), 10.8 (a-NH3+), 8.3 (R group). Alanine (A): 2.4 (a-COOH), 9.7 (a-NH3+). Arginine (R): 2.2 (a-COOH), 9.0 (a-NH3+), 12.5 (R group). Blank #1: What is the overall charge of CAR at pH 7.0? (1 pt) Blank #2: Over what pH range(s) would CAR act as a buffer? Example of a pH range: 2.5 to 4.6.  Separate ranges with commas. (2 pts) Blank #3: Calculate the isoelectric point of this peptide. (1 pt) Consider a fully protonated solution of CAR, which is then titrated with a strong base. Blank #4: How many equivalents of strong base would be necessary to fully titrate CAR? (1 pt) Blank #5: Which group would be titrated first? Say something like "the side chain or arginine" or "the alpha amino group of alanine". (1 pt) Blank #6: What is the pH of the CAR solution after you've added just 0.75 equivalents of the strong base to the original, fully protonated solution of CAR? Hint; think Henderson-Hasselbach equation. (2 pts)

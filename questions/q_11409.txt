(20 points) The new CEO of Outlaw Beverage, Inc. ("Outlaw") has approached you regarding the following facts. Outlaw is a manufacturer of "replenishment drinks" (think, Gatorade and Powerade).  One of Outlaw's now former directors, Betsy King, has formed a new company and started a business where she is selling a new energy drink.  The CEO explains to you that Ms. King attended, while she was a director of Outlaw, a meeting on behalf of Outlaw where a retailer expressed interest in having a private-label energy drink developed by Outlaw for sale by that retailer.  Following that meeting, Ms. King resigned as a director and hired various third parties to develop that drink.  With respect to the brand for the new drink, there appears to be no dispute that Ms. King came up with the name of the product on her own, and her new company applied for the relevant trademarks.  The facts also indicate that she paid for that work, and no funds or resources of Outlaw were used.  Regarding the labelling of the new product, the third-party contractor who was employed to do that work understood that he was working for Ms. King, and not Outlaw.  Finally, with respect to the new drink's formula, Outlaw will concede that its employees were not involved in that formula's creation or that any of Outlaw's funds were used to create the new drink's formula.   The CEO believes that a group of minority shareholders of Outlaw will bring a derivative suit against Ms. King.  The CEO explains that he has consulted another attorney who told him that the only claim by those shareholders against Ms. King would be for breach of fiduciary duty, that fiduciary duty only encompasses a duty of care, and that there is not a good duty of care claim in this situation.  You agree that there is not a good duty of care claim here, but you suspect that the prior attorney may not have been correct in his assessment that fiduciary duty only encompasses the duty of care.   Is there another fiduciary duty claim to be made here against Ms. King and, if so, what facts would you use to support that claim?   (Note that your answer should not discuss derivative litigation, but rather should focus on the other potential fiduciary duty at issue here and how a court using Delaware law would adjudicate whether that other fiduciary duty was or was not breached.)

ESSAY- David Reznick, an ecologist at the University of California at Riverside, studied the process of natural selection in populations of guppies (small freshwater fish) on the island of Trinidad. Reznick found that populations at lower elevations face the assault of predatory fish, whereas the populations at higher elevations live in peace because few predators can move upstream past the waterfalls. The average size of individuals in the higher-elevation waters is larger than the average size of guppies in the lower-elevation populations. Reznick hypothesized that the smaller size of individuals in the lower-elevation populations was a result of increased rates of predation on larger individuals; in effect, predation was selecting for smaller individuals in the population. To test this hypothesis, Reznick moved individuals from the lower elevations to unoccupied pools upstream, where predation was not a factor. Eleven years in these conditions produced a population of individuals that were on average larger than the individuals of the downstream populations. Is the study by Reznick an example of natural selection (does it meet the necessary conditions)? If so, what type of selection does it represent (directional, stabilizing, or disruptive)? Can you think of any alternative hypotheses to explain why the average size of individuals may have shifted through time as a result of moving the population to the upstream (higher-elevation) environment?

An 18 inch diameter (circular cross-section) culvert 50 ft in length and 4% slope is to be placed under a farm road to carry an estimated peak runoff of 15 cfs. The invert elevation of the pipe inlet is 100 ft and the maximum tail-water elevation is 101 feet. The entrance is square and corrugated metal pipe (CMP) is to be installed. Assume that ponding of water above the culvert has no effect on runoff. To what elevation would the road have to be built so that this flow condition would not overtop the road?

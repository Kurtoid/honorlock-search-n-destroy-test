A 100.0 mL sample of 0.300 M NaOH is mixed with a 100.0 mL sample of 0.300 M HNO3 in a coffee cup calorimeter. If both solutions were initially at 35.00degC and the temperature of the resulting solution was recorded as 37.00degC, determine the DHdegrxn (in units of kJ/mol NaOH) for the neutralization reaction between aqueous NaOH and HCl. The specific heat capacity of water = 4.18 J/gdegC. Assume 1) that no heat is lost to the calorimeter or the surroundings, and 2) that the density and the heat capacity of the resulting solution are the same as water.

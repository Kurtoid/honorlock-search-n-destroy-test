Solve the equation. I would like both the exact answer and the answer rounded to four decimal places. 23x=5x+1{"version":"1.1","math":"23x=5x+1"} For this problem, I want your work and answers uploaded to the Dropbox folder "Work for Test #4".  I would also like you to write your rounded answer in the space below. By "exact answer", I mean the answer that you would have without touching your calculator (in other words, the answer that would not have any weird decimal numbers in it that you would only get if you approximated answers with the help of your calculator). And, of course, simply "guessing" the answer is worth 0 points. If there is no work show (in the Dropbox folder), you will get 0 points for this problem.

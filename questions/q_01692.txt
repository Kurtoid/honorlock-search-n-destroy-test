The physical therapist providing the treatment instructed the patient to perform walking exercise on the treadmill. The patient indicated that she felt well and voiced that she wanted to continue the walking treatment for a full 30 minutes.

Once the patient completed the treatment exercise, the physical therapist transported the patient back to the CICU and handed off and made report to the nursing staff caring for the patient.  The patient by that time was having labored breathing and was not recovering as expected from the walking exercise.  Despite all attempts from the nursing and medical staff, the patient coded and later died.

A semicrystalline polymer has a nucleation index n of 2 and a rate constant k of 0.007 s-2 at 90 degC. This polymer is melted and then quenched to 90 degC and allowed to crystallize.  (a) What is the percent of crystallinity of the sample after 10 s.                                                                                                     (3 pts) (b) Assume you need a sample with lower crystallinity now. However, you cannot change the crystallization process. Will you select a semicrystalline polymer of higher or lower molecular weight to start with than the one in (a)? Justify your answer.

Remember to draw free-body diagrams, write equations,  and show all your work.  A camel pushes a 25 kg crate of pineapples across a level floor with a constant horizontal force, Fcam, pointing to the right.  The crate moves 2.4m to the right, accelerating from 3.2 m/s to 5.6 m/s.  The coefficients of friction between the crate and the floor are  ms = 0.60  and mk = 0.40. a)  Find the force of kinetic friction on the crate. b)  Find the work done by friction on the crate

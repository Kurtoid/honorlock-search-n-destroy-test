Sam Blodgett, an employee at Cog Industries, has an employer-sponsored savings plan. Cog offers employees a choice of 12 different mutual funds-three are index funds and among the rest are ones emphasizing international investments, small cap, large cap, and bonds.

Tree diameters are related to "growth rings" in trees and larger diameters are associated with taller trees. The scatter plot of a survey of 958 trees in an old-growth forest in Canada showed evidence of a linear relation between tree height (m) and diameter (cm).   The resulting least squares regression line equation  Height = 2.79 + 0.55x Diameter has an R2 value of 0.92. Which of the following is the slope of the least squares regression line equation?

Block A of mass 5.0 kg and block X are attached to a rope which passes over a pulley, as shown in the figure. An 80-N force P is applied horizontally to block A, keeping it in contact with a rough vertical face. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the wall and block A are " role="presentation">ms = 0.40 and " role="presentation">mk = 0.30. The pulley is light and frictionless. The mass of block X is adjusted until block A moves upward with an acceleration of 1.6 m/s2. What is the mass of block X?

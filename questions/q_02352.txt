Integrative 3 Calvin is interested in the effect of color on taste perception. 40 participants engage in a taste test of a new sour candy.  Half the participants are given candy that is white; the other half are given candy that is green.  Participants taste three pieces of candy, and are then asked to rate, on a 1-30 scale, how strongly the candy tastes like sour lime (higher scores indicate more sour lime taste). Test whether white coloring lowers sour lime flavor ratings; use an alpha = .01 and the values shown below.  **NOTE: You may not need to use all values shown.  Choose the values that are relevant to the test you conduct, and ignore the other values. SS Green = 136.87                    SS White = 171.5                      MD = 4.38 (for Green - White) M Green = 20.13                        M White = 15.75                        s2 (for difference scores) = 52.55 a. Name the specific inferential test that is appropriate for this study. b. Conduct a hypothesis test.

In a three-step process of concentrating 1,000 kg of freshly extracted orange juice containing 12.5 wt% solids and the rest liquid, the juice is first strained, yielding two streams: a) 800 kg of strained juice containing solids and liquid and b) 200 kg of pulpy juice also containing solids and liquid. In the second step, the strained juice stream is concentrated in a vacuum evaporator to give: a) an evaporated juice of 58% solids (the rest liquid) and b) a liquid stream containing no solids. The 200 kg of pulpy juice is bypassed around the evaporator and mixed in the third step with the evaporated juice in a mixer to improve the flavor. The product stream of concentrated juice contains 42 wt% solids (the rest liquid).    Draw a detailed engineering diagram of the process that includes all streams and components, identifies all subunits, and uses the proper labelling notation. Classify the system in terms of the general accounting equation. Perform a degree of freedom analysis for the overall system, each unit, and the entire process. Outline your strategy of performing the mass balance analysis to solve the problem. What is the mass of the second stream (not the evaporated juice stream) leaving the evaporator? Calculate the concentration of solids in the strained juice. What is the mass of the final concentrated juice stream? What is the concentration of solids in the pulpy juice bypassed? How will you check your answers?

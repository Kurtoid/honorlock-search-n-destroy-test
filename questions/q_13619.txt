Use the example of liver failure (cirrhosis) and image below to answer the following questions. The numbers shown in the image are the normal/health numbers (not the liver failure ones).   1. In the case of liver failure the hydrostatic pressure (HP) on the far left (arterial side) would be [direction1].  2. In the case of liver failure the osmotic pressure (OP) on the far left (arterial side) would be [direction2].  3. Therefore the point at which the hydrostatic pressure drops lower than the osmotic pressure which allows water to flow back into the vessel will be [location].

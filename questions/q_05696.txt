An open tank filled with a liquid is connected to a manometer attached to pipeline A. The same liquid is flowing in the pipeline. The gage fluid used is mercury, which is immiscible with the liquid. The cross section of the tank is a square with a dimension of 4 x 4 ft.  a. (35 points) If h = 6 ft, d1 = 6.3 in, the manometer reading d2 = 1 in, and the gage pressure in pipeline A is 5 psi, what is the specific gravity of the liquid in the tank? b. (15 points) A solid cylinder object with a diameter of 3 ft and a length of 6 ft is then introduced into the liquid in the tank. If the specific gravity of the object is 1.4, determine the new manometer reading. Data:  Density of mercury = 26.3 slugs/ft3; density of water = 1.94 slugs/ft3; gravitational acceleration = 32.174 ft/s2
The density of material at the center of a neutron star is approximately 1.00 x 1018 kg/m3.

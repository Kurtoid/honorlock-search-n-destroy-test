The solutions in the two arms of this U-tube are separated by a membrane that is permeable to water and glucose but not to sucrose. Side A is half-filled with a solution of 2 M sucrose and 1 M glucose. Side B is half-filled with 1 M sucrose and 2 M glucose. Initially, the liquid levels on both sides are equal.  Initially (as the system is set up and shown in the figure above, before the system reaches equilibrium), in terms of tonicity, the solution in side A is [answer1] to the solution in side B. (Use proper tonicity terms!) As the system goes towards equilibrium, what will happen to the concentration of glucose in side B? [answer2] Once the system has reached equilibrium, the volume of water in side A will be [answer3] when compared to side B.

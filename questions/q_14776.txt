The following are the main steps in the generation of an action potential.1. Sodium channels are inactivated.2. Voltage-gated potassium channels open and potassium moves out of the cell, initiating repolarization.3. Sodium channels regain their normal properties.4. A graded depolarization brings an area of an excitable membrane to threshold.5. A temporary hyperpolarization occurs.6. Sodium channel activation occurs.7. Sodium ions enter the cell and depolarization occurs.The proper sequence of these events is

Fourteen-month-old Jamar rolled a ball down a staircase. He thought this was funny so he threw another ball, but this time harder. Next, he threw a ball down the stairs, tossing it up in the air first. Then, he tapped a ball softly over the top stair to see how it would bounce down the staircase. According to Piaget, Jamar's father should not be upset by the mess he has made because he is engaging in ______________________ which is part of the __________________.
Dr. Cotta is interested in the causes of behavioral problems among children. To study this, she employs the "Behavioral Tendencies" scale, which uses parents' and teachers' ratings to score children on a scale of 1-70. (Higher scores indicate more behavioral problems.) The population mean on this scale is 29.87. Dr. Cotta suspects that one of the many causes of behavioral problems is a stressful home environment.             She gathers a random sample of 61 children who have been classified as living in a stressful home. For this sample the mean score on the Behavioral Tendencies scale is 36.95. She computes the following test statistic: t = 2.67. If Dr. Cotta conducted a two-tailed hypothesis test (a = .01), a) what decision should she make regarding the null hypothesis? b) Then in "plain English" what does this tell her about the effects of a stressful home environment on behavioral problems and include statistics in APA format? No effect size is needed.

A football player throws a football of mass m kg straight up in the air. The ball leaves the players hand above his head and with a speed of v m/s. It then reaches a maximum potential energy of P joules. Let gravitational potential energy be zero at ground level. At what height in meters did the ball leave the players hand? (Answer in terms of the given variables and any fundamental constants.)

Which stage of cancer indicates that there is systemic spread of the cancer?
You perform an Hfr cross in an effort to map the mutation rif-8 which gives resistance to rifampin. You are given a partial genetic linkage map of E. coli. Your recipient cell contains the rif-8 mutation and also has mutations thrO, thyR, and trpA which inactivate genes for threonine, thymine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, respectively. These mutations are marked on the map and the results of your cross is below.  Your donor strain is wild type for all of these alleles but contains an insertion in its proline gene (Dpro) which may come in handy. You have chosen to use the Hfr strain P801. You can assume the ticks (a-i) are equal distances from each other and from the 100% line. 1) Briefly describe how you would do the cross and the selections that gave you the results below 2) Use the semi-log graph to show where rif-8 would map (the a-i letters will designate places you should put minutes in 10min increments)  3) Tell me which genetic marker rif-8 would most closely transfer with based on its location. 4) How does each row of data in your recombination frequency chart validate this location?

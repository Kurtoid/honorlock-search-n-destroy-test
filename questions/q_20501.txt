Mechanical debris filter is widely used in the coolant systems of nuclear reactor and steam turbine to remove harmful particulates from the flow.  Schematic shows a vertically oriented mechanical filter.  The coolant is pure water (density r=1000kg m-3, viscosity m = 10-3 kg m-1 s-1). The loss constant of the mechanical filter Kfilter = 0.2.  The loss constant of each elbow Kelbow = 0.5.  The diameter of the cylindrical pipe D = 1m.  The pipe horizontal length is 4m, and the vertical height is 5m.  The volumetric flow velocity=10 m3 s-1.  Note: 1 Pa = 1 kg m-1 s-2.  The friction loss through the filter in the center is Wfilter = (1/2) r V2 Kfilter (a) Determine the Reynolds number; (b) If the friction factor of the pipe f = 0.038, calculate the pressure drop between location 1 and location 2 in the unit of Pascal.

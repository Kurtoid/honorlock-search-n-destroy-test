Although the Puritans were hardworking and God-fearing people, they were intolerant, particularly when it came to religion.  Roger Williams was a Massachusetts minister who declared that settlers should purchase land from the Indians rather than simply take it and that government officials should leave religious matters alone.  The Puritans were thoroughly shocked by these notions, and in 1636 they banished Williams from Massachusetts.                At about the same time, a woman by the name of Anne Hutchinson began speaking out on various religious matters.  She differed from most New England ministers on many matters.  For example, she believed that if people were truly inspired by God, they could judge right or wrong on their own without the help of ministers.  For this and similar thoughts, she also was banished from Massachusetts.                During the same period, Puritan settlers were venturing far from the cluster of towns around Boston.  Some went north to settle on land that was claimed by both Massachusetts and by several wealthy individuals in England.  After much confusion, this land, called New Hampshire, became a separate colony with a royal governor.                In 1635, Reverend Thomas Hooker and his entire congregation in Newton decided to move west from Massachusetts to the southern part of the fertile Connecticut River Valley.  There they established several towns, including Hartford, outside the limits of Massachusetts.  Nearby, another group of Puritans founded the town of New Haven.

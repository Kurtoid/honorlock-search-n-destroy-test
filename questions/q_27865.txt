Write the solution (include all steps) to this problem on a piece of paper.  Once completed, hold the solution so I can see it on-camera for at least 3 seconds.  After you submit this exam, you will scan and submit the problems work as a single PDF document to the corresponding dropbox in eCampus for this exam.  The problems you submit to the dropbox must exactly match the problems shown on-camera.  If not, the grade for this exam will be a zero.  Calculators are not allowed on this exam.    For the following problem, find the quadratic function y = f(x) that has the given vertex and whose graph passes through the given point.  Write the function in standard form.

Find the current through R3 using superposition.  Your final answer should include a magnitude and direction.  A positive current flows DOWN, or RIGHT.  A negative current flows UP, or LEFT. Your work, including all calculations, must be typed into the answer box below.   Use the "Insert Math Equation" function.  Answers without an adequate explanation or work/calculations will receive little to no points.    It is required to organize your work clearly.  Label each step you are taking.  Each step should begin with the source that is included, while other sources are shorted/opened.   Next, indicate the total resistance for this modified circuit, with only one source included.  Finally, use the tools  discussed in lecture to find the specified current.

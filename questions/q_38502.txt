The reaction 2CO + O2 --> 2CO2    takes place in the blast furnace in the process of the production of iron.  Estimate the enthalpy change of this reaction, given the following bond  energies:                       BE(C=O) = 1074 kJ/mol                       BE(C=O) = 802 kJ/mol                       BE(C-O) = 351 kJ/mol                       BE(O=O) = 499 kJ/mol                       BE(O-O) = 142 kJ/mol

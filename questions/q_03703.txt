One treatment for OCD is called response prevention - in this therapy, the psychologist triggers the patients obsessive thoughts by showing them the stimuli that trigger them, but then are not allowed to engage in their compulsive behavior. For example, a patient with OCD may compulsively wash his hands after each time he touches a door-knob, because washing his hands provides relief from the obsessive thoughts and the anxiety associated with them. So his therapist has him touch a doorknob in a room that has a faucet nearby. But the patient is not allowed to go over to the faucet to wash his hands.  The intent of this therapy is to break the conditioned association that the patient has between hand-washing behavior and the relief that it provides and to instead show the patient that his anxiety will fade with time.  Given this description of response-prevention therapy, we would probably assume that is is an example of:

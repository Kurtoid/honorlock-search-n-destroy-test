Determine the coherence length with and without an etalon.                                   14. An atom, making a downward transition from the 6th to the 2nd energy level, releases a photon. Determine the (a) energy (J), (b) frequency, (c) wavelength, and (d) wavenumber for this photon                                       15. A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser has an average power of 6 W, a pulse duration of 0.004 ms, and a pulse repetition time of 200 us. Find: a) PRR, b) Duty Cycle, c) Pmax, d) Energy per pulse.                                         16. The initial conditions (energy levels) for a laser active medium are E1 = -1.85 eV to E2 = -0.55 eV and temperature of 1000 F. The active medium is beginning to be pumped and it will reach a stage when E1 = E2 = -1.0 eV, follow up by E2 reaching -1.85 eV and E1 will be -0.55 eV. Calculate the ratio of the numbers of atoms at the two energy levels in each case and discuss the effects on the population inversion and the absorption coefficient of the material.                                         17. A spherical laser cavity has the following parameters: R1 = R2= L/2, and L = 50 cm. a. Draw the cavity configuration. b. Determine if the cavity is stable or not using the stability criterion.

Read the following passage and select the appropriate word from the options provided. List the selected words in order as your answer. Reproductive cyclicity involves the repetitive transition from the follicular phase to the luteal phase. When in the follicular phase the main determinant of follicular growth is due to the release of (1)(estradiol/GnRH/Inhibin) by the (2)(hypothalamus/ovary/follicle). A group of follicles are recruited and transition from (3)(primary/primordial/ secondary/tertiary) follicles to (4)(primary/primordial/secondary/tertiary) follicles. These follicles continue growing and a single follicle will achieve dominance. The other follicles become (5)(smaller/atretic/slower). The dominant follicle signals its presence by producing large amounts of (6)(estradiol/progesterone/ testosterone). This high level of hormone signals the (7)(hypothalamus/pituitary/follicle) to ultimately result in an LH surge. The LH surge is the signal to (8)(luteolyse/cause estrus/ovulate). Comparatively male reproduction is much less cyclic.  This is largely due to having no (9)(tonic center/surge center/ hypothalamus). In the male LH acts on (10)(sperm/sertoli/leydig) cells. This results in the production of (11)(estradiol/testosterone/inhibin). Rate of sperm production is the job of nurse cells called (12)(sperm/sertoli/leydig) cells which respond to the pituitary hormone (13)(FSH/LH/testosterone) by producing more mature sperm.

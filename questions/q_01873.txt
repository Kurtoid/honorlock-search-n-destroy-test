Ade sues Austin in federal court for negligently causing a fire in her automotive repair center in Chicago. A week after the fire, Ade's attorney locates and interviews Peggy, who was drinking wine behind the automotive repair center at the time of the fire. Peggy says she and Tasha saw someone who looked like Austin speed away from the fire just after it began. Ade's counsel made a tape recording of the interview with Peggy. Peggy lives in Chicago, within the district in which the suit is pending. Austin's attorney had asked Peggy to come in to discuss the case informally with him, but Peggy refused.Austin serves interrogatories on Ade asking Ade to "state the names of any witnesses who may have knowledge of the events giving rise to this action."

Ade's counsel responds by objecting to both the interrogatory and the request on the ground of "work product." Which of the following statements is true?

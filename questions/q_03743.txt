Senario QusestionsPlease use the following information to answer the question(s) below.Placozoan evolutionary relationships to other animals are currently unclear, and different phylogenies can be created, depending on the characters used to infer relatedness. Placozoans are multicellular invertebrates with a simple structure of only two tissue layers and only four cell types. They have the smallest amount of DNA measured in any animal. In comparison, sponges have no tissues but about 20 cell types. One species of placozoans, Tp (Trichoplax adhaerens), produces a neuropeptide almost identical to one found in cnidarians. The genome of Tp, although the smallest of any known animal, shares many features of complex eumetazoan (even human!) genomes. The next three questions refer to the phylogenetic trees that follow. In the trees, the outgroup is a taxon that is outside the group of interest; members of the group of interest are more closely related to one another than to the outgroup.Which tree(s) has (have) been created by emphasizing a protein found in placozoans?

A toothpaste manufacturer claims that children brushing their teeth with his company's new toothpaste product will have fewer cavities than children using a competitor's brand. In a carefully supervised study in which children were randomly assigned to one of the two brands of toothpaste for a 2-year period, the number of cavities for children using the new brand was compared with the number of cavities for children using the competitor's brand.  Classify this problem only.

Review each case and indicate the correct code(s).    CT scan of the head/brain w/o contrast Diagnosis: Mental status change. Technique: Axial images were obtained from the skull base to the vertex. No intravenous contrast was administered for this test. Comparison study: 3/15/XXXX Findings: There has been no significant change in one month. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, large vessel infarction, or mass. There is mild small vessel ischemic disease. This is the same as the last scan. Mild ventriculomegaly is reidentified. The skull is unremarkable except for atherosclerotic large vessel calcifications. These are unchanged from the last scan. Impression: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.

Refer to the table. Alkaptonuria is an inborn error of metabolism, caused by defects in an enzyme in the pathway that breaks down tyrosine (see Key Concept 14.1). Humans who are homozygous for one of these mutations make nonfunctional enzyme and accumulate the enzyme's substrate, homogentisic acid, which causes their disease symptoms. In 1996, researchers in Spain cloned and sequenced the gene for the enzyme and characterized several mutant alleles. The table shows the wild-type coding strand sequence for part of the gene and the corresponding region from one of the mutant alleles.      What type of mutation is this?

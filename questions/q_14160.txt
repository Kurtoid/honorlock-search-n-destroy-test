The neurotransmitter and hormone norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, is involved in mobilizing brain and body for action and boosts alertness, but it can also increase restlessness and anxiety.  The lowest-energy conformation of N-protonated norepinephrine is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and the ammonium group. Which of the following Newman projections (A-F) represents this conformation viewed through the C1-C2 bond? [conformation]  Recall that dihedral angles are measured clockwise when answering the next two questions. Consider the conformation of N-protonated norepinephrine in which the hydroxyl group and the ammonium group are eclipsed. What is the dihedral angle between aryl (Ar) substituent and ammonium group in this conformation? [dihedral1] What is the dihedral angle between the aryl (Ar) substituent and the ammonium group in Newman structure A? [dihedral2] Do Newman structures D and F represent conformational isomers? [isomers]

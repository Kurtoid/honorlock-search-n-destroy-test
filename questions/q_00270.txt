Read the essay below and answer the questions that follow. The Selfie Trend A 2016 study reported that 93 million selfies--the photos people take of themselves on their smartphones--are taken every day. And that number continues to grow. People take selfies at work, at home, and at famous sites; in short, they take selfies almost anywhere. Most of these photos end up on social media sites, where friends and family can see them. What is the impact of these millions of photos? Most of the time, selfies are an entertaining way to share experiences. However, recent research suggests that the effects can sometimes be negative. First, posting selfies online could pose a privacy risk. Selfies usually include a lot of features that can identify the photographer. If a person takes a selfie in front of his or her house, it might include the address. New facial recognition software may be able to identify people just from their faces. If the photo includes the photographer's hand, some software may even be able to get a fingerprint from it. In other words, photographers may be sharing more information than they meant to. This is information that other people could use in a negative way. Recent studies suggest that taking and posting a lot of selfies may cause psychological harm. When people take selfies, they become more aware of themselves and how they look. That could be a good thing. However, when people do not like what they see in the selfie, they often take more and more photos, trying to get a photo that makes them look perfect. This search for perfection can result in a decrease in confidence. The study reported that some people begin to feel bad about themselves when they take a lot of selfies. Selfies can also affect relationships. Taking a few selfies here and there can improve relationships. Posting these photos can help friends stay in contact with each other. However, when people post too many selfies, the effect can be the opposite. Their friends may begin to feel annoyed because it seems as if the person is too self-centered, which can create problems in the friendship. Finally, taking selfies can sometimes cause physical harm. This happens when people try to take selfies in dangerous places. They want to impress their friends with a photo from the top of a tall building or by the side of a busy road, for example. Sometimes they pay more attention to the photo than to their own safety. Between 2011 and 2018, more than 250 people died while trying to take a selfie. Many more were injured. Sometimes it is better just to enjoy a beautiful place and put the phone away rather than try to take an impressive selfie. Taking selfies is popular, and it is not likely that people will stop taking them. In fact, it is likely that the number of selfies will increase. However, people who take selfies should be aware that their effects can sometimes be negative. They should be careful where and how they take their selfies and pay attention to how many they post. With this awareness, they can keep the selfie trend positive and fun.   What kind of hook does the writer use? [a1] What is the thesis statement?

On a blank sheet of paper, please do the following:  Write the question number in the upper-left corner and circle it. Logically arrange ALL the terms below into a process map. These terms are all related to the Phospholipase C signal transduction cascade.  Start with the term NEUROTRANSMITTER and continue your story until you have logically arranged all the terms below into a logical story.   NOTE: If an abbreviation is given in the table below, you MUST spell out what that abbreviation means in your map. You CAN use terms from the table below more than once if that helps you to construct a logical process map. You CAN insert extra terms if they help you complete this map, but just make sure they are used correctly!  Make sure to place a few LINKING or ACTION WORDS next to ALL ARROWS to indicate your understanding of how one term leads to the next.  Remember that your process map should be a complete story that reads like a long run-on sentence.   Take a picture of this process map with your cell phone and email that file to your instructor (christopher_machado@cuesta.edu) with the subject line "[YOUR NAME] Unit 2 Exam Process Map" before you submit your exam.   DO NOT share some sort of Google Drive or Adobe Cloud Drive link.   NOTE: You do not need to type anything in the text box below.  Just ignore it!

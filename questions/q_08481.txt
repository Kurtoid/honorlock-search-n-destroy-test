A and B as equal partners formed a partnership. At the beginning of the tax year on formation A contributed equipment with a fair market value of $1,950 and B contributed $1,950 in cash. A originally acquired this equipment 5 years ago in her sole proprietorship business. The equipment had a recovery period of 10 years, and A elected to use straight line depreciation. A and B agreed to share all profits and losses equally. The partnership will maintain the partner's capital accounts according to Reg. 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). The equipment would have had a 10-year recovery period if the partnership had purchased the equipment this year. Each year the partnership will have gross rental income of $390 before taking into account depreciation. The partnership will have no other income and no expenses other than depreciation. Under the remedial method, how much depreciation on the equipment will be allocated by the partnership to B in the first year of operations (Year 1) for tax purposes if A's basis in the equipment (at the time of contribution) was $390?
A Bi-wall polycarbonate greenhouse has a setpoint temperature of 65 oF for heating. The lowest outdoor temperature for sizing the heating system is 43 oF. If the surface area of the greenhouse is 9000 ft2 and the volume of the greenhouse is 53000 ft3, determine the heating requirement of the greenhouse in Btu/h. Assume that the air exchanges per hour is 1.2.   (Please include your computational steps to earn full/partial points)   Q_total = Q_c + Q_i

Financial Analysis Scenario Drone Innovations, Inc. (DII) is a local drone manufacturer that is planning to launch a new drone that uses solar technology which will allow the drone to fly 100 times farther and 100 times longer than any existing drone on the market.  Cost of research and development is $250,000 and the drone market size is currently measured at 4,250,000 of which DII currently serves 50%.  Newspaper advertising will carry a coupon that will entitle the consumer to receive $20.00 off the price of each drone purchased.  Research has shown that 25% of customers will redeem the coupon.  (Hint:  coupon redemption is a variable cost).  The cost of the newspaper advertising (excluding coupon returns) will be $500,000.  Other fixed costs will be $2 million per year.  The cost to produce each drone at $23.  The finding of several research studies has determined that consumers would be willing to pay $80 for each drone at which the retail selling price would be targeted.  The retailer's margin is 30% and the wholesaler's margin is 20%.  (Please type clearly - Round partial units upward.  Round percentages to one decimal point.  Round currency to dollars and cents.)

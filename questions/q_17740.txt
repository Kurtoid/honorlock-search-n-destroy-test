[critical] 4) Calculate the appropriate test statistic. Show your work. Numerator = [Numerator] Denominator = [Denominator] Final obtained test statistic = [TestStat] 5) Decision: [Decision] 6) Effect size: Calculation/work: [Calculation] Final effect size value = [Effect] 7) Plain English interpretation: [PE] APA statistical information: [APA]

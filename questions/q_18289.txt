(2/6) JT was found in his dorm unresponsive with a bottle of Vicodin on the floor.  He was taken to an emergency room, stabilized and admitted to the medical floor for 24-hour observation.  When questioned, he denied suicidal thoughts and continually requested discharge stating: "Everything is fine. I need to go to school in the morning. I have a test." Concerned for his safety, the RN requests a consultation with the Psychiatric Emergency Team (P.E.T.) clinician.  The P.E.T. RN assesses JT and determines that he is in imminent danger of harming himself.  Collateral data shows a recent break-up with his girlfriend and failing grades in school. His appetite is poor and he finds it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. His relationship with his parents is "strained" at best, as they require "perfect behavior and excellent grades." The P.E.T. Team RN places him on a 5150 with a plan to transfer to an inpatient behavioral health facility in the morning. The patient's family asks about the duration of a 5150. As his nurse, you explain:

A farmer grows and sells flowering plants. The best-selling plants are the ones with the most blossoms. The farmer reads an advertisement for a plant food saying that it will make plants grow faster and taller. The farmer predicts that taller plants will have more blossoms and performs the following experiment to test this hypothesis.   Two groups of 10 plants are grown in identical pots filled with equal amounts of identical soil. The amount of sunlight, the room temperature, and the amount of water are held constant for both groups. Group A is given plant food at regular intervals according to the instructions on the package. Group B is not given plant food. The farmer observes the plants after 15 weeks of growth. The results are recorded below.   State the farmer's original hypothesis.  Based on the results of the experiment, was his original hypothesis correct? Explain your answer. Explain why the amount of sunlight, the room temperature, and the amount of water were held constant for both groups. Identify the different variables in your response.

An airline has a toll-free telephone number for reservations.  The airline hopes a caller remains on hold until the call is answered, so as not to lose a potential customer.  The airline recently conducted a randomized experiment to analyze whether callers remained on hold longer, on average, if they heard either (1) an advertisement about the airline and its current promotions, (2) Muzak, or (3) classical music (Vivaldi's Four Seasons).  The boxplots below display the hold times for the 15 customers who participated in the experiment: five who listened to an advertisement, five who listened to Muzak, and five who listened to classical music.  Mark each of the statements below as True or False.  [a] The hold times for those listening to classical music are left-skewed.  [b] Using the IQR, the hold times for those listening to Muzak had the least variability.   [c] All three types of recordings had hold times that were outliers.  [d] Those listening to Muzak had the lowest median hold time among the three types of recordings.   [e] All of the hold times for those listening to classical music were longer than those listening to Muzak.

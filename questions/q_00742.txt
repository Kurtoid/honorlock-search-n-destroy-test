The Laramie Internet Company is considering expanding into a new area, but isn't sure whether it will be cost-effective. The cost of providing internet service to a resident is proportional to the distance to the nearest power line, costing 60 dollars per mile. Given a square two-by-two mile town with power lines along its south and west borders, what is the average service cost over this area? Use one or more double integrals to calculate the average service cost. Be sure to leave the grader a clear path of justified thoughts that led you to your answer.  The shaded area represents the town. The house pictured is about 0.9 miles north of the southern power line, and about 1.65 miles east of the western power line, so it would cost 0.9*60=54 dollars to provide service to this house.

A young female patient involved in a motor vehicle collision responds to painful stimuli by extending her arms and legs. Her airway is open and breathing shallow and irregular. A radial pulse that is moderate in strength is palpated. Her pulse is 64 beats per minute, respirations are 8, and blood pressure is 210/110 mmHg with an SpO2 90%. She has noted deformity to her forehead and a left pupil that is dilated and does not respond to light. Manual in-line stabilization is being held by Emergency Medial Responders (EMR). At this time, the EMT's priority action is to:

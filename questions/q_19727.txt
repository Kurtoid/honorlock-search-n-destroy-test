They only competed with each other for attention. There were no cell phones or the Internet to interfere with their communication. Technology today has certainly improved the way we live in a number of ways, but for many it has negatively affected the way we communicate. This has become a big problem for parents who are concerned that technology is changing how much their children talk with them. Some feel that children spend too much time communicating with their friends on social media. An increasing number of young people grab their cell phones or computer tablets immediately after waking up. They often start their mornings by sending text messages and checking their social media accounts. Nowadays, children don't think that it's unusual to say hello to their friends on their cell phones or online before they greet their own family members. What's the solution? Some parents set limits. They give their children specific times when they can use the Internet and their cell phones. James Harrell and his wife Kim no longer allow computer tablets or cell phones at the table during meals. Sally Johnson lets her children use the Internet only on the weekends, and she isn't going to allow them to have cell phones until they are much older. Other parents have found ways to use technology to their advantage. When Jonathan Wright wants to let his children know it's time to eat, he sends them a text message. Kelly Smith allows her youngest children to share a few social media accounts with her. She proudly says, "It makes my communication with them better. It's my way of talking with them."

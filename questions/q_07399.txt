An ideal silicon PN junction is uniformly doped with ND = 1 x 1017 cm-3 on the N-side and NA = 1 x 1016 cm-3 on the P-side.  Assume that it has semi-infinite QNR and depletion approximation prevails.  Calculate the junction capacitance (CJ, in F/cm2) of this diode at VA= -2 V. (Use T=300K, kT/q = 0.0259 V, Ks=11.8, ni= 1010 cm-3 and e0=8.85x10-14 F/cm)    Enter your final answer here:

A heated, low-rate anaerobic digester is to be designed for an activated sludge WWTP treating the wastewater from a service area with a population of 25,000 people. The fresh sludge contains 0.25 lb dry solids/cap-day, volatile solids are 70% of the dry solids., the dry solids are 5% of the sludge, and the wet specific gravity is 1.01. Sixty-five percent of the volatile solids are destroyed by anaerobic digestion and the fixed solids remain unchanged. The digested sludge has 7% dry solids and a wet specific gravity of 1.03. The operating temperature of the digest is 95 degF and the sludge storage time is 45 days. The sludge occupies the lower half of the tank depth, and the supernatant, scum and gas occupy the upper half of the tank depth. Determine the followings.   Given data  With service area population of 25,000, sludge produced: 6,250 lb dry solids/day Fresh sludge production: 0.25 lb dry solids/cap-day Fresh sludge: 70% VSS; dry solids = 5% of sludge, wet SG = 1.01 VSS reduction: 65% Digested sludge: dry solids = 7% of sludge; wet SG = 1.03 Operating temperature (T): 95 degF Sludge storage time (tS): 45 days Fraction of sludge in digestor (a): 0.5     (4 pts) Fresh sludge volume which is added to the digester (V1) (unit: ft3 sludge/day) (Hint: change mass flow to volumetric flow using V1=T/[

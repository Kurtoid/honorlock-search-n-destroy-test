JJS ' main fare is a freshly prepared, customizable line of sandwiches. It is supplemented with an assortment of drinks, light salads, seasonal fruit and snacks. The restaurant is open 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM, but the peak demand is during lunch hours, 11:30 to 2:00 PM.A customer joining the line makes a sandwich selection by consulting the billboard, marks their selection on a customized form, and hands the form to one of several assemblers who produce the sandwich. The customer does not wait for the sandwich to be assembled, but proceeds directly down the line to select additional items onto their tray. Next, the customer proceeds to pay at the cash register. Finally, (after the payment is completed) they collects their prepared sandwich at a designated location. Selecting the sandwich and marking the form takes 35 seconds.

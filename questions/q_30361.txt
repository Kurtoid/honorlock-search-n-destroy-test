A 13-day-old male child born full-term; weight appropriate for gestational age via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery was brought by his mother to our outpatient clinic for a follow-up visit. The neonate had experienced a 20% weight loss from his birth weight. Mother reports the child has been vomiting "yellow" tinged partially digested milk, about one to two episodes daily since he started feeding and has one to two bowel movements every other day and five to six wet diapers daily. Exam is significant for a cachectic, dehydrated neonate with no appreciable subcutaneous fat. The infant was born to a teenage mother who received routine prenatal care. Upper GI films are shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?        A  Annular pancreas    B  Congenital pancreatic cyst    C  Islet cell adenoma    D  Pancreatic agenesis    E  Pancreas divisum    F  Pyloric stenosis
Questions 14-21 refer to a toy car which can move to the right or left along a horizontal line (the positive part of the distance axis).  Assume that friction is so small that it can be ignored. A force is applied to the car. Choose the one force graph (A through H) for the statement below which could allow the described motion of the car to continue. You may use a choice more than once or not at all. If you think that none is correct, answer choice J.  Question 14: The car moves toward the right (away from the origin) with a steady (constant) velocity.
Use the graph as shown to determine the following limits, and discuss the continuity of the function at .(i)      (ii)   (iii)

In class we covered a reaction called the "pinacol rearrangement" which dehydrates 1,2-diols to yield aldehydes/ketones via carbocation intermediates. An example of a pinacol rearrangement is shown below.  The following deamination (elimination of NH3) of a b-aminoalcohol proceeds through a mechanism similar to that of a pinacol rearrangement. Note the curved arrow indicating that nitrogen gas (:N[?]N:, N2) will depart as a leaving group in the next mechanistic step.  Which of the following species (A-D) is a mechanistic intermediate in this deamination reaction? [intermediate]  Which of the following molecules (E-H) would be the expected major product of this deamination reaction? [product]  Two (2) of the following b-aminoalcohols (I-L) could give the same product as the pinacol rearrangement shown at the very top of this page (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) in the deamination reaction. Answer the following questions about these b-aminoalcohols. Note that ring contraction rearrangements may occur to reduce ring strain. Could b-aminoalcohol K give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon treatment with NaNO2 / HCl? [betaK] Could b-aminoalcohol L give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon treatment with NaNO2 / HCl? [betaL]

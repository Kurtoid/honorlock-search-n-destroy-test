A retiring dentist entered into a written agreement with an agent whereby the agent would receive a commission of 10% of the sale price if he procured a "ready, willing, and able buyer" for the purchase of the dentist's dental practice and if the sale of the practice actually occurred. The agent found a buyer who agreed in writing to buy the practice from the dentist for $500,000, the dentist's asking price. The buyer put up $30,000 as a down payment. The agreement between the dentist and the buyer contained a liquidated damages clause providing that, if the buyer defaulted by failing to tender the balance due of $470,000 within 60 days, damages would be 10% of the purchase price. The dentist included that clause because she was counting on using the proceeds of the sale for another business venture that would likely net her at least $50,000. The buyer became seriously ill and defaulted. When he recovered, he demanded that the dentist return his $30,000, but the dentist refused. The agent also demanded the $30,000 from the dentist and was refused. The agent and the buyer filed separate suits against the dentist, with the buyer pleading impossibility of performance. The two cases are consolidated into a single case. How should the court rule as to the disposition of the $30,000?

After antigen exposure, B cells that react with the antigen undergo clonal expansion and differentiation.  Secretion of antibodies begins.  In the germinal center of follicles, hypermutation of the immunoglobulin variable region genes occurs in the clonally expanding B cells; B cells with certain mutations in the complementarity-determining regions are selected for survival and further clonal expansion while other B cells with different mutations die by apoptosis.  What is the consequence of the mutations that lead to B cell survival and further clonal expansion:

Problem 4 (14 pts): It is a well-known fact that crickets chirp more during warmer temperatures.  A researcher collected data regarding the temperature and the rate at which they heard cricket chirping.  They want to be able to predict the rate of cricket chirps using a given temperature. Here are the results for 7 days.     Temperature (in Fahrenheit)   70   55   58   65   72   68   50     Chirp Rate (per minute)   120   50   54   92   123   118   40      (1 pts) Find the correlation coefficient between temperature and chirp rate. (3 pts) Determine whether a linear relation exists between the two variables. (2 pts) Find the least squares regression line. (5 pts) Interpret the slope and y-intercept of the least squares regression line if it makes sense to. (3 pts) Predict the chirp rate on a day that had a temperature of 61 degrees Fahrenheit. Is this a good prediction? Briefly explain.    Critical Values for Correlation Coefficient     n   Critical Value     3   0.997     4   0.950     5   0.878     6   0.811     7   0.754     8   0.707     9   0.666     10   0.632     11   0.602     12   0.576     13   0.553     14   0.532     15   0.514

In a population of mountain hares, alleles at a single locus determine whether an individual changes its coat color to white in the  winter or keeps its brown coat year round. The W allele causes a shift to white coat and is completely dominant to the w allele. Individuals that are homozygous recessive stay brown all year. Genetic samples from hare skins that were collected by fur traders 100 years ago show that the frequency of the W allele n this population was 0.80.  In the current population, 36% of the rabbits remain brown year round.  From this information, you can determine that the frequency of the w allele is [blank1] and that the population [blank2]  because [blank3]

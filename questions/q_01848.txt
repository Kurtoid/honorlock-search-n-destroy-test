Question 9: Viruses as Therapeutics (Dr. A. Disculescu)    List two Pros- and two Cons- of using adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) as gene therapy tools compared to adenovirus or lentivirus. Briefly explain the advantages and disadvantages in each case. (4 points)        2. Hereditary blindness can be caused by genetic defects in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, where a continuous supply of 11-cis-retinal chromophore is produced from vitamin A. One of the key components of the visual cycle is the RPE65 protein, an isomerohydrolase that converts all-trans retinyl ester to 11-cis retinol in RPE. In 2017, LUXTURNA(tm) (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) from Spark Therapeutics, became the first United States FDA-approved gene therapy product for the eye for the treatment of LCA2 disease, specifically by providing a functional RPE65 gene using an AAV2-CBA-human RPE65 serotype. Provide 2 reasons why the AAV-based RPE65 gene therapy for this disease was relatively easier to develop compared to other inherited disorders. (4 points)       3. Compared to human patients, AAV-viral vector mediated therapy in mouse models of RPE65 deficiency results in robust restoration in retinal function, as determined by electroretinography (ERG) analysis, and preservation of light-sensitive photoreceptor neurons. Select one potential reason for this remarkable success in animal models, from the 2 choices below: (2 points)                 a. Optimum window of treatment: The AAV-mediated gene therapy in animal models was initiated either before the disease onset, or at early stages of retinal degeneration, when the majority of the photoreceptor neurons were still present.               b. AAV viral capsid: A self-complementary AAV vector was used in animal models of RPE65 deficiency, ensuring a faster onset of transgene expression
The nurse is caring for a postoperative patient who had an open cholecystectomy 6 hours ago. The patient is complaining of pain at a 7 on the 0-10 scale.  The nurse had a similar patient last week who had the same procedure, but had very little pain. The nurse understands which of the following that explains this difference?
5. Consider the different scheduling algorithms described in the Cache Affinity paper. Given the two different graphs from the paper shown below, why is it that Last Processor (LP), shown with the dark dashed lines in the graphs, is closer to First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) in one case (top graph), and to Fixed Processor (FP) in the other (bottom graph). FCFS and FP are shown with solid dark lines. The graphs illustrate the change in the system throughput (on the y-axis) as a function of the normalized cache footprint of the task (on the x-axis), for two different scenarios: with 48 tasks (top graph) and with 128 tasks total (bottom graph). In both cases, the results were obtained on a machine with 32 processors. You should ignore the thin dotted lines, which correspond to the case when the authors are also modeling interference effects.

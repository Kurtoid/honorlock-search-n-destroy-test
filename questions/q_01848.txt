Question 4 Frederick is the office manager for a small law firm, and one of his weekly tasks is to order pastries (bagels, muffins, donuts, or danish) and coffee (hot or iced) for the firm's weekly staff meeting. One of the partners, Karen, is very opinionated and does not like donuts or iced coffee.  Normally Frederick chooses what pastries and coffee to order each week to ensure that donuts and iced coffee are never ordered in the same week and are never ordered two weeks in a row, but he is going to be out on paternity leave for the next 6 weeks and so he has set up a program to place the orders for him that will randomly select the pastries and coffee each week.    Pastries and coffee selections will be made independently of each other and weekly decisions are independent.       Pastry   Probability       Coffee   Probability     Bagels   0.30       Hot   0.75     Muffins   0.25       Iced   0.25     Donuts   0.15                 Danish   0.30                   e) What is the probability that Karen dislikes at least one of the items ordered in exactly 4 of the 6 weeks that Frederick is on leave that Frederick is on leave?

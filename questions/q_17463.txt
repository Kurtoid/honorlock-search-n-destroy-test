work out the answers to the following question on a piece of paper and upload it after you exit the exam -----------------    The spectra above correspond to an alcohol with the formula C8H10O. Some peaks are zoomed-in for clarity. a) Select one peak (Ha - He) on the 1H NMR spectrum and give a piece of the molecule based on that peak. Explain how you arrive at your answer for full credit. Be specific in your explanation by referencing the relative area, chemical shift, multiplicity and integration of the peak.  b) Use the spectra and your spectroscopy tables to propose a structure for the alcohol. Show your work for partial credit. c) Label the molecule with the corresponding peaks for the carbon NMR.

Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr A sample of gas collected at 21.0degC and 660 mm Hg, has a volume of 1.83 liters. What will the pressure of the gas be if the temperature is increased to 38.0degC and the volume is reduced to1.50 liters?

Irrigation is used on a field where cropping is carried out year round. The electrical conductivity (EC) of the irrigation water is 1.5 dS/m and the maximum allowable EC of the deep percolation water as it leaves the root zone is 12.0 dS/m. The net evapotranspiration (ET) of the crops is 1,400 mm per year and the effective annual precipitation is 250 mm per year, of which 200 mm contributes to the crop requirements and 50 mm applies to leaching of salts. Find the total amount of irrigation water (in mm) that must be applied annually to maintain the salt status of the soil? Give an example of crop that could be grown under these conditions and the likely yield with respect to the maximum yield obtainable. Cite the reference from where you obtained the crop information.

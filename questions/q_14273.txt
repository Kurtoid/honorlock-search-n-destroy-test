Look at the following schedule. It is not appropriate based on the guidelines discussed in class because of the amount of time spent in each part. Rewrite it to be appropriate for 3 yr old children. You can rearrange the order, change the times, take out or add a portion if need be. The only part you can not change is the start of the day (8:00) and the end time (11:00). 8:00-8:30 Large Group Time (whole class) 8:30-8:45 Story Time 8:45-9:30 Small Group Time (groups of 8-10) 9:30-10:00 Snack Time 10:00-10:30 Outside Time 10:30-11:00 Play Time (centers)
Cones and rods are _______ and are found on the _______ of the eye.
Let's suppose that we have a leaky bucket with the following parameters:  Bucket size is 6000 packets  Leak rate is 1000 packets per second Assume initially the bucket is empty and the arrival packet is dropped if the bucket overflows. Assume that we have traffic arriving at the leaky bucket with an arrival rate as shown in the figure below.     How many seconds will it take for all packets to leave the leaky bucket? (Type your answer as an integer.)

What is structure E?
A nurse is preparing to administer potassium chloride 40 mEq suspension PO daily. The amount available is potassium chloride suspension 10 mEq/mL. How many mL should the nurse administer? (Round the answer to the nearest whole number).  ______ mLs
In class we covered a reaction called the "pinacol rearrangement" which dehydrates 1,2-diols to yield aldehydes/ketones via carbocation intermediates. An example of a pinacol rearrangement is shown below.  The following deamination (elimination of NH3) of a b-aminoalcohol proceeds through a mechanism similar to that of a pinacol rearrangement. Note the curved arrow indicating that nitrogen gas (:N[?]N:, N2) will depart as a leaving group in the next mechanistic step.  Which of the following species (A-D) is a mechanistic intermediate in this deamination reaction? [intermediate]  Which of the following molecules (E-H) would be the expected major product of this deamination reaction? [product]  Two (2) of the following b-aminoalcohols (I-L) could give the same product as the pinacol rearrangement shown at the very top of this page (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) in the deamination reaction. Answer the following questions about these b-aminoalcohols. Note that ring contraction rearrangements may occur to reduce ring strain. Could b-aminoalcohol J give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon treatment with NaNO2 / HCl? [betaJ] Could b-aminoalcohol L give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon treatment with NaNO2 / HCl? [betaL]

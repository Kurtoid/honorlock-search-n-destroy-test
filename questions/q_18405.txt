Consider the power delay profile given below. If you see two pictures, they should be the same. If you see one picture, that's ok. If you do not see any pictures, the power delay profile can be described as follows:  There are 3 spikes:  a 0 dB spike at tau=0us,   a -7 dB at tau = 2us, and a -10dB spike at tau = 3us        Assume that a signal with a 50 kHz bandwidth is being transmitted at 2 GHz through this channel to a mobile.  What is the mean excess delay for this channel?  What is the rms delay spread for this channel? What is the maximum excess delay (8 dB) for this channel? What is the 90% coherence bandwidth for this channel?  Is this a flat fading channel relative to 90% coherence for the signal described above (yes or no)?

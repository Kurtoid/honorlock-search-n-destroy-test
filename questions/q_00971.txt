The hypothesis that men in high stress jobs have an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease was tested during an 18-year follow-up study from 2000-2017 of a group of 8,000 men of Japanese ancestry in Hawaii.  Of the 4,500 men with higher stress jobs, 3,000 of them developed CHD; of the 3,500 men with lower stress jobs, 1,800 of them developed CHD. All 8,000 men completed the CHD examination at the end of study, 3,200 were free of prevalent coronary heart disease (CHD), while 4,800 had incident CHD (there was no loss to follow up).           Disease             Have CHD   No CHD         Exposed ( high stress jobs)   3000   1500   4500     Not exposed (low stress jobs)   1800   1700   3500     Calculate the cumulative incidence of CHD for those exposed to higher stress jobs:

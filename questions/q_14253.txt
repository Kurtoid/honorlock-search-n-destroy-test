In this image, what affect did ATP have on the ATP-sensitive K+ channel?   ATP closed the channel  In step C, we can see that a depolarization activates/opens the voltage-dependent Ca++ channel.  In order for a depolarization to occur, K+ channels in the previous step (step B) would need to close.  This would prevent K+ from leaking out of the cell, which would result in an accumulation of positively charged ions inside the cell--depolarizing it.  If K+ channels were opened, this would lead to more K+ leaving the cell, which would hyperpolarize the cell...similar to what is seen in the after-hyperpolarization phase of an action potential.

Stare decisis means "to stand by things decided." This doctrine applies whenever a higher court hears an appeal from a lower court's decision and affirms that decision.
5. (10 points, 5 minutes) (Branch Prediction, waterfall diagram) Consider the following LC-2200 instruction sequence:  BEQ R1, R2, TARGET ADD R3, R4, R5 ADD R6, R7, R8TARGET: NAND R1, R1, R2 ADD R9, R10, R11   Given:  Register forwarding Hardware branch prediction assumes branch will not be taken Each stage can generate a NOP instruction for the next stage if there is a need to stall an instruction at any given stage.    In the actual run of the program, the branch is actually taken. Starting from the BEQ instruction, fill the table showing the passage of the instructions shown above through the 5-stage pipeline.

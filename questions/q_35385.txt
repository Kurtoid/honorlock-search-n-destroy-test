15. Argon Corp. had capacity to produce 15,000 units of L3 using 30,000 kg of direct materials at the beginning of the year. Argon produced 14,750 units of L3 by processing 27,500 kg of direct materials. The conversion cost per kg of materials is $4.00 and the conversion cost per unit of L3 is $7.46. Argon can add or reduce manufacturing capacity in increments of 1,500 kgs. The cost of unused capacity for conversion costs of Argon is _________________________.

Please write a policy for one of the following case studies: Case Study 1 From Hayes and Ninemeier textbook, page 314 "Let me see if I understand," said Allisha, the Food and Beverage Director at Foxwoods Country Club, as she reviewed the employee file of Lani Meier, a dining room server. "Lani has worked here for five years with no write-ups. Now, in the two weeks since you have become her supervisor, Lani is at stage three of our progressive discipline process, and your recommendation is suspension."  "She did it to herself, Allisha," replied Michelle, a former dining room server and Lani's new boss. "Lani never liked me. I think she is jealous of me, but I played it straight up. Every write-up I give is legitimate. She needs to be suspended or fired, because I don't think she'll ever change."  Allisha reviewed the file one more time. Lani's first written oral warning, dated 10 days ago, was for returning from her unpaid lunch period 10 minutes late. Lani stated that she had gone to the bank and was caught at a train crossing returning to work, which delayed her timely return.  The written warning followed two days later, when Lani was reprimanded for being out of uniform. In fact, in the written report, Lani admitted that she was working without a nametag, but that she was on her way to the locker room to put it on when a club member asked her some questions. While Lani was responding to the member, Michelle noticed she was "working while out of uniform," verified that Lani had already punched in, and, as a result, wrote her up.  The suspension that Michelle was now proposing was the result of an incident yesterday when, as required by the employee handbook, Lani failed to notify her supervisor four hours before her shift began that she would not be at work as assigned on the schedule.  Interestingly, Allisha had talked to Lani earlier in the day, and Lani mentioned she had taken her son to the emergency room on the previous morning. She was scheduled to work at 7 A.M. and had left a voice mail on Michele's office phone at 5 A.M.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Case Study 2  "I like his personality a lot, but I don't know, I just didn't like his looks," said Mini, the cafeteria supervisor. "What was wrong?" asked Teri Settles, the Dietitian in charge of the hospital foodservice operation where Mini worked. Mini and Terri were discussing Josh, a 23-year-old man who had interviewed for a job bussing tables in the hospital's public dining room. "It was his neck," replied Mini. "He had these black things that looked like geometric designs on his neck!" "Tattoos?" asked Terri. "Yes," replied Mini. "I don't understand these young people." "I don't know, Mini. I'm not so sure they are all that much different than we were at that age," replied Terri.

Alex offers to buy Hay's ticket at the "market price," which was $300 on the day of the offer.  Hay had bought her ticket for $75, and she doesn't want to take advantage of her friend, but she knows she is going to need money to buy books for her second year of law school, so she agrees to sell the ticket to Alex for the "market price."  When the day comes for Hay to sell her ticket, the market price for Rude Rabbit tickets has jumped to $700.  Hay points out that they had a binding agreement.  Alex is contractually obligated to either buy the ticket or face a lawsuit.  Alex goes to the concert, but he has an obstructed view.  He angrily texts Hay from the concert, attaching photos of the pillar that blocks his view.  She texts back, advising Alex to read the back of his ticket.  He does so and discovers that it provides in very fine print that there will be no refunds based on, among other things, obstructed views.  Can Alex seek to avoid his contract with Hay based on unconscionability?

Which of the following is NOT involved in the Calvin Cycle? (1 pt)
An implementation of RSA performs exponentiation by going through the exponent one bit at a time. For a bit in the exponent, it squares the result - this is done regardless of what the value of the exponent's bit is. Then, only if the exponent's bit is tested, the result is multiplied with the message (in this code, exp, res, and msg are large numbers, and each of them occupies thousands of bytes in memory): // For each bit in the exponentfor(int bit_idx=nbits-1; bit_idx>=0; bit_idx--){   BN_sqr(res,res); // res=res*res;   // Get bit_idx'th bit from large number exp   bool bit= get_bit_at_index(exp,bit_idx);   if(bit)      BN_mul(res,res,msg); // res=res*msg} While Betty is using this RSA implementation to sign a message, Evan is running his attack application on the same server, so that Betty's RSA signing program and Evan's attack program share the cache. Before Evan can successfully perform a Prime+Probe attack and discover Betty's secret exponent, he needs to know (or find out) a few facts. You answer should have two paragraphs, one for part A and one for part B below.  Evan needs to know (or write test programs that measure) a few parameters of the cache on the server system. Name at least one property of the server's cache hardware that Evan really must know. Explain why Evan must know the value of that cache property. Evan needs to know something about the data use in the large-number exponentiation code use by Betty. Name at least one variable and at least one property of that variable that Evan must know. Explain why Evan must know that specific fact about that specific variable.

Problem 1 (10 points) A saving certificate that cost $5000 now will pay $7500 in five years. What is the interest rate? Problem 2 (20 points) A speculator in land and property pays $180,000 for a house that he expects to hold for 10 years. $7,000 is spent in renovation and a monthly rent of $800 is collected from the tenants who live in the house (assume all rent is paid at the end of the year). Taxes are $2500 per year and maintenance costs are $1500 per year. What must the sales price be in 10 years to realize a 6% rate of return? Problem 3 (20 points) A low-cost non-contact temperature measuring tool may be able to identify railroad car wheels that are in need of repair long before a costly structural failure occurs.  If the BNSF railroad saves $100,000 in this year, $110,000 in next year, and amounts increasing by $10,000 each year for five years, what is the future worth of the savings in year 8 at an interest rate of 10% per year? Problem 4 (25 points) For the cash flow below, find the value of X that makes the equivalent annual worth in years 1 through 7 equal to $300 per year. The interest rate is 10% per year.

Its driving-out price is $26,500, but he has only 5,500 dollars in his bank account. He decided to finance $21,000 from a bank. The bank provides a 8-year auto loan with zero down-payment and annual installments (interest rate 6%). 1. How much is the amount of the annual installment (A0) if the amount is distributed equally among 8 years? 2. Jeremy paid A0 annually up to the end of year 5 and he wants to pay-off the remaining amount at the end of year 5. Determine the pay-off amount. 3. What is the total interest Jeremy paid?

You treat some cells with a proteolytic enzyme that is too large to penetrate the cell membrane (Set 1). Another group of cells is made permeable before treatment with the enzyme (Set 2). A third set of cells was not treated with the enzyme at all (controls). Proteins are then extracted from the three different sets of cells and applied to an SDS-PAGE gel. Protein W migrates to the same distance on a gel of proteins from Set 1 and Set 2; Protein W migrates a shorter distance on gels of proteins extracted from the control group than on gels of proteins extracted from Set 1 and Set 2 treated cells. Protein X migrates to the same distance on a gel of proteins from control cells and the gels of the proteins from Set 1 and Set 2. Protein Y migrates a longer distance when extracted from Set 1 cells than does protein Y in the controls; Protein Y moves an even larger distance in the gel of the extracts from Set 2. Which protein has an extension only on the exterior of the cell?

Provide at least two characteristics of each distribution and a specific example of how each can be used in biology.

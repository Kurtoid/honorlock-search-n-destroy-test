While humans rarely cross paths with the venomous green mamba (a West African snake), most documented bites have been fatal.  In part, this is because one component of the venom activates receptors for the hormone ANP.  Which of the following would be the most likely cause of death from green mamba venom?  (You must justify your answer to receive credit.)  Excessive vasoconstriction decreases blood flow, leading to myocardial infraction (heart attack). Increased permeability of pacemaker cells to K+ leads to drastically slowed HR which proves fatal. Loss of Na+ by the kidney coupled with vasodilation leads to systemic shock due to acute hypotension. Reduction in Ca2+ entering cardiac contractile cells leads to drastically lower SV which proves fatal.

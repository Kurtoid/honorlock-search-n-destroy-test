69.) Pregnant women who have gestational diabetes have all of the following issues post delivery Except:
A disk has mass m = 10 kg, outer radius Ro = 1.5 m, Ri = 0.5m, and mass moment of inertia  .  The disk rolls without slipping on its inner radius at point B.  A cord is wrapped around the inner radius and passes over a pulley of radius rP = 0.2 m and is connected to a mass mF = 2 kg. In addition to the cord, there is a force P = 30 N acting tangentially and horizontally to the outer radius of the disk and a spring of stiffness k = 25 N/m that wraps around the outer radius of the disk. The spring is initially unstretched when the system is released from rest. (a) (30 points) Assuming that the pulley is massless, find the speed of the wheel, vC, after the wheel rotates through 90 degrees. (b) (5 points) If the pulley has mass mP = 0.5 kg and radius of gyration kP = 0.1 m, will your result for vC in part (a) increase or decrease? You need not obtain a numerical result or expression, but explain and justify your prediction.
Read the following scenario and answer the question(s) below.The formation of sinkholes has become a fairly common phenomenon in the state of Florida. Most sinkholes are small, but some sinkholes have led to catastrophic property damage and loss of life. One September day in 1999, folks began to notice that Lake Jackson in the panhandle region was shrinking. Within a few days, it was almost gone. A sinkhole had opened beneath the lake and drained it, along with all of the fish and alligators. Another sinkhole formed just 10 miles from Walt Disney World in August 2013, swallowing a 48-unit villa at Summer Bay Resort.As aquifers lose water, their substrates can become weaker and less capable of supporting overlying strata and any human structures built upon them. In such cases, the land surface above may subside. Sometimes subsidence can occur locally and suddenly, in the form of sinkholes, areas where the ground gives way with little warning. Once the ground subsides, soil becomes compacted, losing the porosity that enabled it to hold water. Recharging a depleted aquifer may therefore become more difficult.Sinkholes are an extreme form of ________.

A researcher studies how a beam of small light nuclei (z=2), with 1.5 MeV of energy, is scattered by the Coulomb interaction from a thin foil of lead (Pb, Z=82).  When the detector is placed at a scattering angle of [theta1] degrees, the experimenter measures [N1] light nuclei per minute.     The experimenter moves the particle detector to a new position at angle [theta2] degrees.  At this new angle the number of light nuclei per minute is expected to be

Consider a two tank mixing system. Let A and B be the two tanks. Both the tanks initially contain 100 gallons of brine. Initially, tank A contains 20 pounds of salt, and tank B contains 30 pounds of salt. Fresh water enters tank A at 12 gallons per minute and flows out of tank A and into tank B at 16 gallons per minute. Solution from tank B flows into tank A at 4 gallons per minute, and a second outlet drains the solution from tank B at 12 gallons per minute. Assume that the solution is well mixed when entering and leaving both the tanks. Form a first order system modelling this situation, and solve the resulting IVP using eigenvalue-eigenvector approach. *Hint: Apply the conservation of substance principle to both tanks, i.e.   Q '  =  r i   c i  -  r o   c o  {"version":"1.1","math":"Q' = r_ic_i-r_oc_o"}. Drawing a schematic might be helpful.

On 2/1, Bank-1 makes an operating loan to D secured by all D's present and after-acquired equipment. Bank-1 perfects by filing a financing statement on that same date. On 3/1, D enters into a contract to buy a bulldozer from Seller. Seller agrees to make the sale on credit and on that same day (3/1) D grants Seller a security interest in the bulldozer as collateral for its obligation to pay the purchase price. D then gets busy and it is 5/1 before she finally picks up the bulldozer from Seller's place of business. This causes Seller to realize that it never filed a financing statement, and it finally gets around to doing so on 5/10. If D defaults to both Bank-1 and Seller, which of the following answers is correct?

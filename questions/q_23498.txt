Bishop has a flock of Plymouth Rock chickens. She selects the heaviest 2% of her roosters based on their own 8-week weight. Her roosters (sires) average 0.75 years of age when their offspring are born. She saves the heaviest 10% of her hens based on their own 8-week weight with a generation interval of 1.0 year. Assume the h2WT = .36, sBV = .90 lb, and sP = 1.4 lb. Average 8-week weight before selection began was 6.5 lbs.    What is the expected genetic response per year when mating the selected roosters and hens together based on phenotype?                    2. What is the expected genetic response per year in 8-week weight when selecting males based on egg weight EPD with the following information? h2EW = .45         sPEW = 4.6 g         rBVWT,BVEW = .00 Roosters that Ms. Bishop purchased ranked in the top 5% of the breed for Egg Weight EPD.                 3. Which selection strategy works the best to increase 8-week weight and why?

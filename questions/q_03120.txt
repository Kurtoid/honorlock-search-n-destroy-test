All animals with eyes or eye spots that have been studied so far share a gene in common.  When mutated, the gene Pax-6 causes lack of eyes in fruit flies, tiny eyes in mice, and missing eye parts in humans.  The sequence of Pax-6 in humans and mice is identical.  There are so few sequence differences with fruit fly Pax-6 that the human/mouse version can cause eye formation in eyeless fruit flies, even though vertebrates and invertebrates last shared a common ancestor more than 500 million years ago. The appearance of Pax-6 in all animals with eyes can be explained in multiple ways.  Based on the information above, which explanation is most likely?

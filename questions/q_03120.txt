Question 13:  The function  models the average time, , in hours that a new production team takes to assemble one TV where t is the number of days of training the team received. The graph of this function is shown below.      a) Use the graph to obtain a reasonable estimate of the average time it would take a production team to assemble one TV if the team received 3 days of training.   b) Using the graph, after how many days of training (or no training at all) is the length of time to assemble one TV the greatest?   c) Use the function's equation to determine how many hours it would take a production team to assemble a TV if they had 5 days of training. Round to the nearest tenth.   d) The asymptote of the function represents the time a production team takes to assemble one TV as the number of days of training increases. What is the equation of the horizontal asymptote associated with this function? Express as an equation.

This is a multi-part free-response question. Write down your answers on a piece of blank paper. Show your answer to your camera for a few seconds once you're done. Within 10 minutes after you have completed the entire exam in Honorlock, scan all your hand-written answers and send to Dr. Xue (jxue@mse.ufl.edu).   Compound Semiconductor Alloys:  You wish to grow a laser diode on an InP substrate which can emit 1.55 mm light and have no dislocation in the epitaxial layer.   Please explain why neither InGaAs nor InAlAs ternary alloys can be used for this purpose? (6 points) Please explain why there is a transition from indirect band gap to direct band gap for InxAl1-xAs as x varies from 0 to 1? (6 points) The quaternary InxGayAl1-x-yAs could be used to meet the requirements. Please calculate the required compositions (i.e., values of x and y) of InxGayAl1-x-yAs.  The alloy bowing parameter for InxGa1-xAs is 0.45 eV and that for AlxGa1-xAs in the direct bandgap composition region is 0.70 eV. (10 points)

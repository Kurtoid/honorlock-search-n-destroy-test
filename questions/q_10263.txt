If reset is 0 it should shift the value of the register 1 bit to the left and replace the lowest order right most bit with x. Output y should be the left most or most significant bit. Use System Verilog, don't use datatype reg, use always_comb and always_ff as appropriate for always blocks. Use System Verilog, don't use datatype reg, use always_comb and always_ff as appropriate for always blocks. Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect.

In a study of heart surgery, 200 subjects were randomly divided into two groups of 100. One group received a beta-blocker while the other group was given a placebo. The pulse rate at a particular time during the surgery was measured.  Researchers are interested in knowing if beta-blockers reduce the pulse rate at a 5% significance level.    The results are given below.       Population Sample Size Sample Mean  Sample Standard Deviation   1 beta-blockers 100 68.5 7.3   2 Placebo 100 70.5 8.6    Complete each space with the appropriate answer Since the researchers [color1], we need a [color2] alternative. We can perform a [color3] since this is a [color4], and sample sizes are [color5]. The SE for the average of group 1 is  [color6], and the SE for the average of group 2 is  [color7], so the SE for the difference of the averages is [color8]. The test statistic is [color9]. The p-value is [color10].  This is [color11] the significance level of 5%, so we will [color12], and conclude that [color13]

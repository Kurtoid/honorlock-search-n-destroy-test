For the aqueous reaction:      A (aq) + 3B (aq) - 4C (s) + 2D (aq) the equilibrium constant (Kc) is [kc] at the temperature of [T] K. The reaction was set to run at [T] K so, that initially there is no C in the solution, and concentrations of A and B are [concA] M and [concB] M, correspondingly.  Calculate the initial concentration of  D (in M) if the value of Gibbs free energy (DG) at that moment is [dG] kJ/mol (round your answer to 3 decimal places).

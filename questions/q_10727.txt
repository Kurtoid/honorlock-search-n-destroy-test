Let the function f : N - R be defined recursively as follows:      Initial Condition:  f (0) = 0Recursive Part:  f (n) = (2 * f (n-1)) + 1, for all n > 0 Consider how to prove the following statement about this given function f using induction. For all nonnegative integers n, f (n) = 2n- 1. Select the best response for each question below about how this proof by induction should be done.  Q1.  Which of the following would be a correct Basis step for this proof?   [Basis] A.  For n = k, assume f(k) = 2k - 1 for some integer k >= 0, so f(n) = 2n - 1 for n = k. B.  For n = 1, f(n) = f(1) = 2*f(0) +1 = 1; also 2n - 1 = 21 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1, so f(n) = 2n - 1 for n = 1. C.  For n = k+1, f(k+1) = 2(k+1) - 1 when f(k) = 2k - 1 for some integer k >= 0, so f(n) = 2n - 1 for n = k+1. D.  For n = 0, f(n) = f(0) = 0; also 2n - 1 = 20 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0, so f(n) = 2n - 1 for n = 0.  Q2.  Which of the following would be a correct Inductive Hypothesis for this proof?   [InductiveHypothesis] A.  Assume f(k+1) = 2(k+1) - 1 when f(k) = 2k - 1 for some integer k >= 0. B.  Assume f(k) = 2k - 1 for some integer k >= 0. C.  Prove f(k) = 2k - 1 for some integer k >= 0. D.  Prove f(k) = 2k - 1 for all integers k >= 0. Q3.  Which of the following would be a correct completion of the Inductive Step for this proof?   [InductiveStep] A.  f(k+1) = 2*f(k) + 1, which confirms the recursive part of the definition. B.  When f(k+1) = (2(k+1) - 1) = (2(k+1) - 2) + 1 = 2*(2k - 1) + 1; also f(k+1) = 2*f(k) + 1, so f(k) = (2k - 1), confirming the induction hypothesis. C.  When the inductive hypothesis is true, f(k+1) = 2*f(k) + 1 = 2*(2k - 1) + 1 = (2(k+1) - 2) + 1 = (2(k+1) - 1). D.  When the inductive hypothesis is true, f(k+1) = (2(k+1) - 1) = (2(k+1) - 2) + 1 = 2*(2k - 1) + 1 = 2*f(k) + 1, which confirms the recursive part of the definition. Q4.  Which of the following would be a correct conclusion for this proof?   [Conclusion] A.  By the principle of mathematical induction, f(n) = (2n - 1) for all integers n >= 0. B.  By the principle of mathematical induction, f(k) = f(k+1) for all integers k >= 0. C.  By the principle of mathematical induction, f(n+1) = (2*f(k)) + 1 for all integers n >= 0. D.  By the principle of mathematical induction, f(k) = (2k - 1) implies f(k+1) = (2(k+1) - 1) for all integers k >= 0.

Residents of Spain and most Latin American countries usually have two last names (dos apellidos): the first one is inherited from the father, and the second one from the mother. The first of these names, the paternal family name, is considered primary, and is the one passed on to future generations. For example, when we look at the name of Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal we know that Garcia is his father's family name (that is, inherited from his father), and Bernal is his mother's family name (that is, inherited from his mother). When Gael Garcia Bernal and Argentine actress Dolores Fonzi (with only one family name, from her father, because her family is Italian) had a son, they named him Lazaro Garcia Fonzi. Their daughter is Libertad Garcia Fonzi. PASO 2:  Match the phrases [the mother (madre) or father (padre) of a particular person] with [that parent's FULL NAME].  The parents have all been labelled as a mom or a dad so you don't have to guess at genders.

Read the lab description and answer questions 1-7 Jill was tasked with determining which brand of pen is most likely to attract a termite. She selected 5 brands of black ink pen, Bic, Precision V5, Sharpie, Papermate, Pilot, plus a pencil. Jill knows from previous experience that the termites are attracted to ink from a black Bic pen and are not attracted to lead from a pencil. To complete the experiment Jill drew a 5 cm diameter circle with each pen and placed a termite 0.5 cm from each circle. She then gave the termite 30 seconds to find the circle and travel around the circle. Jill defined positive results as a termite finding the circle within 30 seconds and then following the circle at least half way around. A negative result would be a termite that was unable to find the circle within 30 seconds or a termite that found the circle but followed it for less than half the circle. Jill tested five termites on each brand of pen for a total of thirty termites. The results of Jill's experiment are found in the table below.  Table 1: Number of termites that found the black 5 cm diameter circle within 30 seconds and then followed the circle for at least half the total distance.

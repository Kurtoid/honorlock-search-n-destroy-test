Problem  No. 1  A double angle shape, 2L6x4x5/16 is connected by a  3/4 -in gusset plate with LLBB as shown below.  The total tensile service load (unfactored load)  applied is it is 25% dead load and 75% live load.  The bolts are 7/8-in-diameter, A325 bearing-type.  The angle material is A572 Grade 50 steel, and the gusset is A36 steel. Hint: Check all possible failure possibilities, including block shear. Gage spacing (bolt raw spacing) see Manual p1-52 (Table 1-7A). Based on this answer the following question: Question 1.16: In the BLOCK SHEAR in the angles the net tension area is equal to what? [Enter value in inches]

A local outdoor pig farm that provides pigs to a regional barbeque restaurant chain has had several sows that have aborted their litters in late gestation recently, followed by litters with stillborn pigs, weak pigs at birth and as a consequence, liveborn litter size has been reduced. This is upsetting to the owner as well as financially devastating since he relies on the specialty market to receive a premium price for his pigs. On the farm visit to investigate the problem, you notice that the pigs have ready access to a creek and to pond water, as well as other pools of standing water and mud holes.    In addition to instituting an appropriate vaccination program, you advise the farmer to:
A type of arrhythmia associated with an increase risk of CVA is called:
In mammals, colostrum (or "first milk") is produced by the mother in late pregnancy and shortly after giving birth to feed the newborn. In addition to nutrients, it is particularly rich in antibodies that are absorbed through the intestinal epithelium and support the weak immune system of the infant. Occasionally, some infants suffer from either respiratory acidosis or alkalosis. In acidosis, the blood pH becomes acidic due to lack of sufficient ventilation, while the opposite happens in alkalosis due to hyperventilation. Considering the molecular mechanism of transcytosis in intestinal epithelia, which of these conditions--acidosis or alkalosis --would you expect to interfere more with antibody absorption by transcytosis in these infants?

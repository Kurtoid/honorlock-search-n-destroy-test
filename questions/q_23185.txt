Genetic inheritance is being studied in a certain species of plant in which orange flower color (O) is dominant to white (o) and round leaf shape (S) is dominant to oval (s). A true-breeding orange-flowered, round-leaved male plant (Plant A) is mated with a true-breeding white-flowered, oval-leaved female plant (Plant B) to produce dihybrid offspring plant (Plant C). Assuming normal Mendelian genetics and independent inheritance of these two traits, which gamete might be produced by Plant C?

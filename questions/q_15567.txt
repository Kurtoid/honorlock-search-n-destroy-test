The following data represent the pH of rain for a random sample of 12 rain dates.  A normal probability plot suggests the data could come from a population that is normally distributed.  A boxplot indicates there are no outliers.    5.20 5.72 5.24 4.80   5.02 4.58 4.74 5.19   4.61 4.76 4.56 5.68    Construct and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the mean pH of rainwater.

Question 4: Model Comparison and Prediction (4a) 3pts - Compare the AICs and BICs of model2, model3, and model4. Which model is preferred based on these criteria and why? (4b) 5pts - Using model2, model3, and model4, give a binary classification to each of the test rows in dataTest, with 1 indicating an NBA rookie lasting at least 5 years in the league. Use 0.5 as your classification threshold. (4b.1) For each model, what is the classification error rate over these data points? (4b.2) Which model has the highest predictive power? (4c) 4pts - Refit model2 on dataFull, and call it model5. Then, perform 10-fold cross validation and leave one out cross validation with model5 to compare classification error rates. How do these two classification error rates compare to the model2 classification error rate from 4b? Apply your knowledge of cross validation to explain your results. (4d) 3pts - Using the same predicting variables as in model4, build a random forest model. Call it model_rf. Hint: Convert target_5yrs to a factor. (4d.1) What is the benefit of a random forest over a decision tree?(4d.2) Using model_rf, give a binary classification to each of the test rows in dataTest, with 1 indicating an NBA rookie lasting at least 5 years in the league. Use 0.5 as your classification threshold. What is the classification error rate over these data points? (4d.3) How does the model_rf classification error rate compare to the model2, model3, and model4 classification error rates obtained in (4b.1)?

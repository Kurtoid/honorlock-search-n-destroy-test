Problem 2bc Using the result of your Boolean simplification from problem a) for the function F = ABC' + AB'C' + AB b) Write a Verilog or System Verilog module named Funs that evaluates your simplified F from 2a) using a structural model. To get credit this should be done using a structural model. Inputs are A, B and C. Output is F. All variables should be declared. c) Write a Verilog or System Verilog module named Funb that evaluates your simplified F from 2a) using a Boolean expression. To get credit this should be done using a Boolean expression (which, by the way is a Behavioral model). Inputs are A, B and C. Output is F. Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables. Do not use compiler directives. Your work should be typed into the window provided, you can drag the bottom right hand corner to make the window bigger, you cannot use the tab key

The following is an imaginary chemical reaction involving the molecules "empty-brain" and "hard-work." The conversion of "empty-brain" and "hard-work" to "good-grade" and "knowledge" cannot occur on its own. The enzyme studyase can help speed up this reaction.  What is/are the substrate(s) of this chemical reaction? (1pt) What is/are the product(s) of this chemical reaction? (1pt) Do you think this is an endergonic or exergonic reaction?  And WHY? (2pts) Based upon your answer to #3 right above, what do you think is missing from the chemical equation? And WHY? (2pts) The optimal temperature for studyase is 37degC. You boil the studyase before adding it to the reaction. What will happen to the rate of reaction and WHY? (2pts) What if you added the molecule "50+ hour a week job" to the enzyme studyase, it binds to a site on the enzyme that is NOT the active site and affects the function of the enzyme. What could it do to the rate of the reaction? (1pt) The molecule "50+ hour a week job" could be called a(n)_________________________. (1pt)

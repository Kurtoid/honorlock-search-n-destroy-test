By acknowledge these exam conditions, I acknowledge my personal responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the examination process.  I will keep all personal items, such as cell phones, ipods, smartwatches or other communication devices securely stored during all testing procedures. I will not leave the area I am in during the exam. Restroom breaks should be taken before or after taking the exam. I will not attempt to access the internet, use a telephone or otherwise communicate with outside resources during the exam. I will show (front and back) my blank whiteboard to the camera prior to starting the exam and after answering my last test question if this quiz is in an online forum. I will maintain the integrity of the exam process by refraining from discussing exam items with anyone other than my professor until exam grades are posted. I will follow up with my professor(s) after the exam, if I have questions or concerns about my exam performance.  I understand that academic dishonesty is a violation of the university's code of conduct. I also understand that my exam will not be graded and I will receive a zero unless I acknowledge these conditions of the exam.

Use the answer bank below to answer the questions unless its a number then just type that in (make sure its a whole number, no decimals.)   Cardiac output is calculated by [37] (37) x[38](38). So if EDV = 100 ml and ESV = 50 ml and the heart is beating 100 times per minute what is cardiac output:[39] (39: put in the number in L/min). Stroke volume is determined by 3 things: the amount of blood in the heart before contraction called: [40] (40) and measured by: [41] (41), the pressure the left ventricle has to overcome to get blood out called:[42](42) and measured by [43](43), and the force of contraction called:[44](44) and measured by [45](45). During exercise venous return increases drastically due to increased muscle pump this would lead to an increase in which volume: [46](46). The strength of heart contraction is controlled by [47](47) which causes more [48](48) to flow into cardiac myocytes leading to [49] (49) which leads to a stronger contraction. This increase in contraction strength increases stroke volume by decreasing [50](50: cardiac measurement).       A. End diastolic volume   E. Systolic blood pressure   I. Afterload   M. Parasympathetic nervous system   Q. Ca++     B. End systolic volume   F. Contractility   J. Heart rate   N. Somatic nervous system   R. Stronger action potential     C. Ejection fraction   G. Stroke volume   K. Aortic stenosis   O. Na+   S. More actin/myosin interaction     D. Mean arterial pressure   H. Preload   L. Sympathetic nervous system   P. K+   T. More filling time

It has been an absolute pleasure to be your instructor for this. During the course, I hope you learned some things about me (good and bad). I believe that chemical kinetics is the most important course in chemical engineering and makes a chemical engineer unique (don't tell the transport folks, they may take it badly).  At this point, I hope you have built enough confidence to tackle reactor design and kinetics problem. However, I'd like to ask: When you encounter a reactor design problem, what do you do? A) Run for the hills! B) Some critical thinking, but mostly prayers . C) Follow the process. Write your mole balances, your reaction rates, work out your stoichiometry, sprinkle in some pressure drop, heat it (or cool it down) a bit, and finally maybe even account for your catalyst performance (internal transport, external transport).  D) Build a detective wall!

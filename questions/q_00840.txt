Note: mwpc example answer = "xyzw" where w, x, y, z are variable names. access_sequence  example answer = "abbbaabdbaacbbacab" where a, b, c, d are variable names. MWPC Consider the access sequence : abbbaabdbaacbbacab (i) Construct access graph using your scrap paper. Find the MWPC (Maximum weighted path cover) solution. mwpc = [mwpc1]path weight = [weight1] cost = [cost1] (ii) In the above access sequence, abb represents b = a + b; similarly cab represents b = c + a; bdb represents b = b + d; Perform commutative transform on all three of the above (each instruction has only two operands which will be commutatively transformed; all three commutative transforms are done in one step and not in 3 steps). Regenerate access sequence and redo MWPC on the modified graph;  access_sequence = [access_sequence2]mwpc = [mwpc2]mwpc path weight = [weight2]cost = [cost2] (iii) Using the original code from part (i), first generate a code snippet based on the access sequence (code snippet will be something like: b = a + b; a = c + c) and then find a pair of variables which can be safely coalesced. Using this coalescing, regenerate the access sequence (using coalesced variable X) and redo MWPC on it. Coalesced Variable Name and variables = [coalesced] (Comma Separate the Coalesced Variable name, followed by the variables that are coalesced. EG: X,a,b) access_sequence = [access_sequence3]mwpc = [mwpc3]mwpc path weight = [weight3]cost =  [cost3]

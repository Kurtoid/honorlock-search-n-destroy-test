Sorbose is a stereoisomer of the sugar fructose. Its sweetness is similar to that of table sugar and it is used in the commercial production of Vitamin C. One enantiomer of sorbose, namely D-sorbose, is shown below. D-sorbose can exist in an open chain form (D-sorbose) or it can cyclize to form a six-membered ring (a-D-sorbopyranose). Answer the questions below about D-sorbose and a-D-sorbopyranose.  Which of the Fischer projections (A-F) below represent D-sorbose? [Fischer]  Which of the chair conformations (T-Z) below represent the MOST stable conformation of a-L-sorbopyranose? [Mchair] Which of the chair conformations (T-Z) below represent the LEAST stable conformation of a-L-sorbopyranose? [Lchair]  How many total stereoisomers are possible for a-D-sorbopyranose (including the one drawn)? [stereopyr] How many diastereomers are possible for D-sorbose?

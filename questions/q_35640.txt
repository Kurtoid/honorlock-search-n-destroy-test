Dr. Cline, the owner of the River Tilt Pharmacy, is starting an opioid call back program. The call back program includes the following tasks: (a) identify patient eligibility, (b) describe the purpose of the call to his staff, (c) develop a script to inform the patient and for the call, (d) document relevant patient information (e.g., medication) prior to making the call, (e) identify a time to call the patient and who will make the call, (f) determine outcomes to track, (g) make the calls and document results, and (h) assess the success of the program.  In lecture, we talked about how these tasks could be mapped onto the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process (PPCP) wheel from a system level (i.e., how to provide the service). For any 3 of the 5 parts of the PPCP wheel, identify at least one task from the opioid call back program that could be mapped to that part of the PPCP wheel and explain how the particular task from the opioid call back program fits into that part of the PPCP wheel. (Your response for each part of the wheel selected should be no more than two sentences or six sentences in total).

Refer to the figure showing the phylogeny of three extant species of turtles.  Species 1 and 2 have a particular bone structure, while species 3 does not. The most generally accepted opinion is that the structure evolved after species 1 and 2 diverged from species 3. Recently, some scientists have questioned this and suggested that the structure evolved before species 1, 2, and 3 diverged from the common ancestor and that the structure was lost in species 3. Two fossils (A and B) have been discovered. Which information from these fossils would best support the new claim that species 3 lost the structure?

In response to the advertisement, an office supply retailer sent a written order to the paper supply company for 150 rolls of register tape. In the letter that accompanied the retailer's order, the retailer stated that it would send the paper supply company payment of $1,500 upon delivery. The letter also stated that the register tape must be compatible with three specified commonly used cash register models.

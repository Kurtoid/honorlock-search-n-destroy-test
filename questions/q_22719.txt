Please use the following information to answer the question(s) below.The cycads, a mostly tropical phylum of gymnosperms, evolved about 300 million years ago and were dominant forms during the age of the dinosaurs. Though their sperm are flagellated, their ovules are pollinated by beetles. These beetles get nutrition (they eat pollen) and shelter from microsporophylls (leaflike structures that contain microsporangia). Upon visiting megasporophylls (leaflike structures where megaspores are formed), the beetles transfer pollen to the exposed ovules. In cycads, pollen cones and seed cones are borne on different plants. Cycads synthesize neurotoxins, especially in the seeds, that are effective against most animals, including humans.Which feature of cycads makes them similar to many angiosperms?1. They have exposed ovules.2. They have flagellated sperm.3. They are pollinated by animals.

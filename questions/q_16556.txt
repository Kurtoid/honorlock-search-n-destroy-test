In the previous question, the graph representing a typical photosynthetic temperature response curve for a species that is able to acclimate to growth temperature had two lines.  One of the lines represents the curve when plants of this species are grown at 20degC, and the other line represents the curve when plants of this same species are grown at 35degC.   Which line represents the plants grown at 35degC?

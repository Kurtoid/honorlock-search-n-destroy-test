Lois Landlord received a rental application from Risky Renter.  Risky had no credit, no references, but seemed "nice".  Lois agreed to rent the apartment to Risky for $1050 per month, plus $1075 for a last months rent deposit and $750 for a damage deposit (refundable).  Risky was thrilled because no one else was prepared to rent to him. Unfortunately, Risky's cheque for the LMR went NSF (a bank error).

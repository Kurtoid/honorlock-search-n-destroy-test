You have been hired by the City of Final Exam, Florida to design three gravity sludge thickeners (2 operational) for processing primary and secondary solids. The primary sludge flow is anticipated to be 0.028 MGD with a solid concentration of 4.5% and a specific gravity (SG) of 1.027. The secondary sludge flow is anticipated to be 0.16 MGD with a solids concentration of 0.35% and a specific gravity (SG) of 1.008. Using a solids loading rate of the 4.0 lb/day-ft2, calculate the following:  (4 pts) Determine the combined dry solids mass flow rate (lb/day) (Hint: MCS = MPS + MWAS) (4 pts) If the combined dry solids mass flow rate is 15,504 lb/day, determine combined percent solids in sludge (%) (4 pts) If the combined dry solids mass flow rate is 15,504 lb/day, calculate the design diameter (feet) if thicker mechanisms are available in 5-ft increments of diameter (4 pts) If the combined dry solids mass flow rate is 15,504 lb/day and design diameter is 50 feet, calculate design solids loading rate (lb/day-ft2) (4 pts) If the design diameter is 50 feet, determine design hydraulic loading rate (gpd/ft2)

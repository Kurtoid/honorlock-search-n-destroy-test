You've now learned about the serial position curve. The relevant research in your text describes this curve using a free recall task (participants are free to recall words in any order they choose). Imagine that you conducted the same experiment, but required people to recall the words in the same order they were presented. What would you predict for the results in terms of the recency and primacy effects?

There is an inverse relationship between bond ratings and the required return on a bond. The required return is lowest for AAA-rated bonds, and required returns increase as the ratings get lower.
Cell membranes have distinct inside and outside faces. There is a "sidedness" to each of the phospholipid layers that comprise the bilayer structure of the membranes. So, transmembrane proteins can have a directional orientation since the two sides of a cell membrane face different environments and carry out different functions.

Acme Industries, Inc. produces coyote traps in its factories in Minneapolis, Butte and Dallas to sell in its retail stores in Salt Lake City and Phoenix. Traps are first shipped to distribution centers in Cheyenne and Albuquerque and then shipped to the retail stores. The shipping costs, demands and capacities are given in the table below. The costs are interpreted as follows: The cost to ship one trap from Dallas to Albuquerque is $7, the cost to ship one trap from Cheyenne to Phoenix is $20...        From/To   Cheyenne   Albuquerque   Salt Lake City   Phoenix   Factory Capacity     Minneapolis   $10   $15     300     Dallas   $12   $7     500     Butte   $8   $22     200     Cheyenne     $8   $20      Albuquerque     $13   $8      Store Demand     600   400         Here is the network diagram that corresponds to Acme's distribution problem.        Define an appropriate set of decision variables. No need to list them all. Write a generalizable description or write out 3 decision variables so that I can see the pattern.

Getting Started: (Tracing) You are helping your family paint the front of your beach house with a Memorial Day theme. You have enough red paint for the trim, but you need to determine how much blue paint you need so you dig up some old house plans in the attic and next to them is some old MATLAB code that someone has left unfinished. The main function (calculateBlueArea()) and its helper functions (mainHouse(), window(), door() and roof()) are supposed to be written to calculate the area covered by blue paint on the diagram below. As an example, if the following variable definitions and function call were executed in the Command Window, the value 736 should be assigned to the variable "area". Trace the code for understanding and to find any errors that may be present. Then answer the questions that follow.    House Plans     Command Window  >> a = 32; >> b = 24; >> c = 4; >> d = 32; >> area = calculateBlueArea(a, b, c, d)    Function Definitions  1 - function [area] = calculateBlueArea(a,b,c,d) 2 -     mainHouseBlueArea = mainHouse(b,D) - window(c) - window(c) - door(c); 3 -     area = mainHouseBlueArea + roof(a,b,d); 4 - end 5 -  6 - function [area] = mainHouse(h,w) 7 -     area = h*w; 8 - end 9 -  10- function [area] = window(w) 11-     area = (2*w)^2; 12- end 13-  14- function [area] = door(w) 15-     area = 2*w^2; 16- end 17- 18- function % this is intentionally left blank; see question 319-    h = h1-h2; 20-    area = (b*h)/2; 21- endIndicate your answers to the multiple choice questions below.Example:1) 2) 3) 4)  1) Which of the following lines should be used to replace line 2?    mainHouseBlueArea = mainHouse(b,D) - 2*window(c) - door(c); mainHouseBlueArea = mainHouse(b,d) - window(c) - window(c) + door(c);  mainHouseBlueArea = mainHouse(b,d) - window(c) - window(c) - door(c);  The code on the line is correct. No replacement is necessary.       2) The code on line 11 should be changed to which of the following?     area = w*2^2; area = 2*w^2;  area = 2*w*2;  The code on the line is correct. No replacement is necessary.       3) Which of the following function headers should be used to replace the first line of the helper function on line 18?     function [area] = roof(h1,h2,b)  function [area, base] = roof(h1,h2,b)  function [area] = roof(h2,h1,b)  function [area] = roof(h1,h2,B)       4) When the code is corrected and functioning properly, what will be the value stored in variable "area" on line 15 when the code is run from the Command Window with the input shown above?     64  736  32  16

10.  Prodrugs are pharmaceuticals that are rendered into an active form upon the action of the body's metabolism.  Melphalan, an antineoplastic drug, is not readily absorbed if taken orally.  One possible way to overcome this poor absorption is to link it to a diglyceride, shown below.  Explain how oral administration of this prodrug could lead to free melphalan in the lymphatic system.  (Basically, take me through what happens to triacylglycerols during digestion.)  (6 pts)

2.  About 10% of the human population is left-handed.  Suppose that a researcher speculates that artists are more likely to be left-handed than other people in the general population.  The researcher surveys 150 artists and finds that 23 of them are left-handed.  Based on this sample, is there enough evidence that the population proportion of artists who are left-handed is more than the 10% (or 0.10).  (While answering the following sub-parts of this question, you will be including the null and alternative hypothesis, the test statistic, the p-value (a visualization and an interpretation), your statistical decision, and your conclusion in the context of the problem.) (c) Interpret the p-value for Step 3 of the hypothesis test.

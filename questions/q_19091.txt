Read the following scenario to answer the following question. In late 2006, bee workers in the United States started to notice a disturbing phenomenon: the sudden disappearance of honeybees from commercial hives. This mysterious condition was called "colony collapse disorder," and it has caused a drastic reduction in commercial honeybee populations all over the country. It is estimated that one-third of our food supply relies on bees and is in danger. Crops that rely most heavily on honeybees include apples, almonds, blueberries, and pumpkins. If colony collapse disorder cannot be cured or treated effectively, farmers may have to turn to other insects, perhaps other bee species or even moths.   Without honeybees, which process in the life cycle of plants such as apples, almonds, blueberries, and pumpkins is most affected?  A) seed dispersal B) secondary growth C) pollination D) seed germination

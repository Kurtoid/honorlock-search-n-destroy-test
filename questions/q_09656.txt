SCENARIO: ACME Health is an Alabama based manufacturer specializing in innovative devices for the health care industry.  ACME is looking to improve the application of it's angioplasty balloons used to clear blocked arteries.  Feedback from their customers (cardiologists, nurses, hospital administrators, etc.), indicate that there exists a need to minimize re-occurrence of blockages after angioplasty surgery. The ACME team developed a concept for a mechanical device that would be permanently inserted into a patient's blocked artery during the angioplasty procedure.  ACME expects this new product concept to fit nicely within it's current product portfolio while targeting existing customer segments. ACME has completed a preliminary patent search and found several idea concepts similar to ACME's idea that have been patented or applied for patent protection. .  ACME can work around these patents but will not be able to limit competitors entry into the market.  The proposed stated concept will require special materials and development of a surgical insertion process.  This new device is not similar to any of the other ACME products currently produced and will require extensive development of new manufacturing processes.  The development costs for this ground breaking device will also require a large development expense commitment in order to meet the stringent regulatory requirements for medical devices.  As with any new medical devices, the high liability risk will require extensive R&D and product reliability and product use testing. ACME senior management recognize the high reward opportunity and have a strong desire to bring a successful new-to-the-world product to market will enable them to maintain their market leadership position.  However, with limited capital available to invest and the high risk of a new-to-the-world product, the senior management team requires a 1st pass screening to be completed. Q5 - Read the following new product concept overview (above) and then match each of the 7 "1st pass screen" questions (below and on the left) to the appropriate statements extracted from the narrative: (21points)

Write a JavaFX GUI program with file name LastnameFirstnameExam5.java that meets the following requirements and adheres to the layout included sketch.  Must set the title of the window to be "1331 Exam 5 - YOURNAME", where YOURNAME is replaced with your first and last name. Must include some non-editable text at the top to the window (not the title) with a short phrase of your choosing. Change the text font to either Georgia, Papyrus, Courier New, or Comic Sans MS; it cannot be the default font. Font size should be 12. Must include a plain Button.  The button must toggle the color of the short phrase between Color.BLACK and your favorite color.  Make sure this color is still visible in the UI (i.e. the color should be dark enough to be seen). You must set the button text to something of your choosing.   Must use the provided image below. We recommend that you use an ImageView to display the image.     WARNING: We will be compiling this from the command line with the image file in the same directory as the source code. If you choose to use an IDE during development, make sure that you place the image in whatever directory will allow it to load by only specifying the filename without any path information. (i.e. you should open the file as "filename.png", not "..filename.png", "/Users/Pictures/filename.png", etc.)   Must include a select one-of-many toggle group to control the alignment of the image displayed. There should be 3 alignment options for Top, Center, and Bottom.  Hint: StackPane has a setAlignment method. You may place this group beside or below the image.  In order to actually see the alignment change you will need to ensure that your window/stage is large enough. So, you need to set the size of your stage to be large enough to see the change proportional to the the size of your image. A good ratio is to make the window 3 times the width and height of the Image. To do this you can use the following methods: stage.setMinWidth(X); and stage.setMinHeight(Y);   Must use a Slider UI control that will control the opacity of the image.  The Slider's major tick labels should be displayed (setShowTickLabels) The Slider should have a minimum value of 0.0, maximum value of 1.0, and initial value of 1.0 Hint: Opacity is specified as a value between 0.0 (completely transparent) and 1.0 (completely opaque). Another Hint: Look closely at Slider's constructors to find one that allows for configuration of the min/max/init values on creation of the Slider to make your life easier. Yet Another Hint: There are several ways to implement the event handling, we recommend using the setOnMouseReleased method that is available to any Node   You must use at least one of the following children of Pane to control the layout of the Nodes: BorderPane, GridPane, HBox, or VBox. You must implement your event handling at least two of the three ways we taught: named inner class, anonymous inner class, and lambda expression.  For example, at least one handler as an anonymous inner class and at least one handler as a lambda expression. Failure to implement handlers in two different ways will result in the loss of points.   Points may be deducted if your layout deviates greatly from the one shown below. However, you do not need to have a border around the pane containing your image nor around the image itself. You may place the one-of-many toggle group below or beside the Image.  YOUR SHOULD ONLY SUBMIT A SINGLE JAVA FILE. ENSURE THAT ANY OTHER CLASSES YOU INCLUDE EXIST WITHIN THE SAME FILE. IF YOUR SUBMITTED CODE DOES NOT COMPILE, YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO. SAVE, BACKUP, AND TEST OFTEN! The following is an example layout for your UI, but as long as you meet the requirements stated above the layout is flexible:

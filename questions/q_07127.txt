An issue for TCP arises when answering search queries (using data centers in CDNs). A study indicated that 'handshake' and 'slow start' cause lots of delay, with 7 segments on average needed for every query. This causes average query delay of [x1], where RTT is the round trip time between the client and the original server. One suggestion to reduce delay is to use a front-end server with much smaller RTT to the client (call it RTTFE), and a [x2]. Delay from the front-end server to the original server is also ~RTT. The new setup (called Split TCP) would have a new calculated delay of [x3], which can be approximated to [x4] if we assume that RTTFE is much smaller than RTT (i.e., RTTFE

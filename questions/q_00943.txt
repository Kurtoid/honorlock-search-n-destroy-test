QUESTION 5             P and Q are identical spheres. Sphere P moves along a smooth horizontal surface and collides with sphere Q, which is initially stationary. After the collision:  sphere P moves off with a momentum of 0.096 kg.ms-1 in a direction of 15deg to its initial direction. sphere Q moves off with a momentum of 0.14 kg.ms-1 in a direction of 10deg as shown.              Right click on the button to open the diagram in a new window.                         5.1   Use a scaled vector diagram to show that the magnitude of the total momentum of spheres P and Q after the collision is about 0.2 kg.ms-1.   (4)                   5.2   State the principle of conservation of linear momentum.   (2)                   5.3   Calculate the initial velocity of sphere P. mass of sphere P = 0.12 kg   (2)

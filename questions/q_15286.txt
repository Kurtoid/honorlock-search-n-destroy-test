Suppose you record the price of a house (measured in dollars) and its living space (measured in square feet) for 100 randomly selected houses in Auburn. Your sample contains houses with living spaces ranging from 750 to 3500 square feet. A scatterplot indicates a linear relationship between the two variables. Suppose that the coefficient of determination is 0.78 and the prediction equation is as follows: price = 45000 + 110 space. (a) What would it mean for price and space  if these variables had a negative association? (b) Interpret the coefficient of determination in context. (c) Predict the price of a house in Auburn that has 5000 square feet living space. Comment on the appropriateness to use the prediction equation for this case. (d) What would be the value of the correlation coefficient? Is it an appropriate measure of the strength of the relationship between price and space? (e) Interpret the slope of the prediction equation in context.

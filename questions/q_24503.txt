Label as Q-XY on your paper. (7 min.) You must show all your work for this problem on your paper.  You must show starting variables, starting equations, and use one step equation dimensional analysis where applicable.  In addition to showing you work on paper, you must state you final answer(s) here with units.  Failure to do so will result in zero credit regardless of your work on paper. Consider the reaction below:  2 XY (g)  -  2 X (g)  +  Y2 (g) For this second order reaction, the rate constant is 0.9880 M-1s-1 at 70. degrees C.  A) Starting with a concentration of 0.7741 M, calculate the concentration of XY after 600.0 s. B) Calculate the half life when the concentration of XY at time zero is 1.0510 M. Type final answers with appropriate letter.

Three vertical steel wires are loaded as shown. At a temperature of 68degF, the bottom ends of the wire were at the same elevation with no load on the bar. A downward load of 500 lb was then centrally applied on the bar and the temperature was increased by 100deg.  a) What load is carried by each wire assuming the load bar remains horizontal? (Put all labeled answers in box 1 below.) b) To what temperature must the wires be heated before the load is entirely carried by the middle wire? (Put answer in box 2 below.)

The last question on every exam will be reminders to --> upload your scanned scratchwork to the exam dropbox AND --> a reminder to show me your worksurface a second time before submitting the exam. Humor me while I ask you to do this on this exam. Here's what you'll see on regular unit exams: THING #1 : Once you finish the exam, scan all pages of your scratch work and upload as a multi-page .pdf to the Exam Dropbox (within one hour of finishing the exam). You can find this under "Dropbox" on the main page of your eCampus course. THING #2 : Before you hit "Submit", use your webcam to show me your worksurface again.  Show me your worksurface again now on the practice exam.

The velocity of the water jet discharging from the orifice can be obtained from v =  [?](2gh) , where h = 2m is the depth of the orifice from the free water surface. Determine the time for a particle of water leaving the orifice to reach point B and the horizontal distance x where it hits the surface.

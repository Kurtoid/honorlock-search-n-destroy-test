Make sure when you plug a value in for a variable, you are doing it in parenthesis. This makes sure you correctly handle the negative sign.  Example: t2 when t=-4 To solve this, replace t with ( ) so you get ( )2 then plug the -4 in. Your expression should look like (-4)2. Evaluating this means (-4)(-4) because the exponent of 2 distributes on both the negative sign AND the number. Your solution is 16 because two negatives multiplied together make a positive If you have -42, this means -(4)(4); the exponent does NOT distribute to the negative because there is no parenthesis. The solution to this is -16. A much different outcome than (-4)2. Keep this in mind while you solving the upcoming questions.

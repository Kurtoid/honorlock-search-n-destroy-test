Bonus question for 2 bonus pts: You repeat the entire experiment but this time you add glucose to the beakers that already contain sucrose at the indicated concentrations.  The membranes of carrot cells are permeable to glucose. If you assume that the mass of glucose is negligible and does not contribute to mass increase or loss, and therefore you are only measuring water gain or loss, which line on the graph would represent carrot cells steeped in 0.6M sucrose and  0.1 M glucose and which line represents carrot cells steeped in 0.6M sucrose and 1.0 M glucose? 0.1 M glucose [answer1] 1.0 M glucose [answer2]

Figure 4 shows a circuit with seven scannable flip-flops (within the same clock domain), some are positive-edge triggered while some are negative-edge triggered.                 Submit everything on-line.             (a) Connect them into a single scan chain. You do not need to really design the details. Just give the scan ordering, e.g., A -> E -> F..... (b) Assume 700 test patterns are required to fully test the above circuit. How many test clock cycles are required? (c) If flip-flops (FFs) C and E have capture time violation during testing because of excessive clock skew. What should be done to fix this      problem ? (d) Assume circuit delays for CKT1 and CKT2 in Figure 4 are the same (e.g., 4 ns), and we compare the sensitivity to capture time violation      between FFs (C, E) and FFs (D, F). Which one is more sensitive? Give the reason. (e) If a lock-up latch is inserted between FFs C and E to fix the clock skew problem during scan mode, how many test clock cycles are      required due to the addition of this extra lock-up latch? Again, 700 test patterns will be applied.

Clark Kent was injured while saving Lois Lane (again). He was on bed rest for two weeks and today is his first day back training with you, his exercise physiologist. You are starting him out with a very light aerobic workout: walk at 67 m/min at a 1.5% grade for 45 minutes. Enter the energy expenditure in terms of VO2 ml/kg/min. Round to the nearest whole number and do not include units in your answer.  Equations:Age predicted maximum heart rate = 220 - age Intensity: Percent of age predicted heart rate maximum = (220 - age) x (% intensity / 100) Heart rate reserve = (HRmax/peak - HRrest) x (% intensity / 100) + HRrest VO2 Reserve = (VO2max/peak - VO2rest) x (% intensity / 100) + VO2rest Metabolic Equations: Walking: VO2 = 3.5 + (0.1 x speed) + (1.8 x speed x grade)  Jogging: VO2 = 3.5 + (0.2 x speed) + (0.9 x speed x grade)

A battery is connected to the capacitor circuit shown below providing a potential difference of 215 V. The capacitor values are all in microfarads.    a) Find the equivalent capacitance for the capacitor circuit. b) How much energy is provided by the battery for the capacitors in this circuit? c) Calculate the charge on the 222 mF capacitor. d) What is the potential difference across the 57 mF cap? e) Calculate the energy stored by the 107 mF capacitor. part a) What is the equivalent capacitance for          11. The circuit has been rewritten again above with the correct capacitance values filled in. Simplify the circuit further using these values by solving for the unknown value shown in the figure below. Again, round to 3 decimal places and do not include units.    I = ?

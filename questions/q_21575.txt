Question 4 c - numeric solution A cosmetology school runs a hair salon that is staffed by students and is very popular because of their low prices.  Students working at the salon are classified as underclassmen or upperclassmen, and 65% of the student employees are upperclassmen.  Each customer is randomly assigned a stylist when they arrive for an appointment. At the end of each appointment, the customer completes a short survey and provides a rating out of 5 stars (where 1 is low and 5 is high) for the service they received.  The pmfs of the ratings received by upperclassmen and underclassmen over the past year are given below.   Underclassmen                                                               Upperclassmen     Probability   Score       Probability   Score     0.15   1 star       0.05   1 star     0.10   2 stars       0.10   2 stars     0.25   3 stars       0.20   3 stars     0.40   4 stars       0.40   4 stars     0.10   5 stars       0.25   5 stars       c) Bernice is an underclassman stylist who just started working at the salon.  Her peer mentor is going to take her out for ice cream when she gets her first 5-star review.  If Bernice serves one customer per day, what is the probability that she gets to go for ice cream at the end of her 5th day in the salon?

The following setting is for Question 2 and Question 3. Consider the following setting under the Rosen-Roback framework. There are two cities. Firms and households move across cities to attain the highest possible profit (for firms) and utility (for households). Assume that City 2 offers better amenities (such as a pleasant climate), making City 2 a better place to live than City 1. Assume further that City 2 has more productive amenities (for example, positive knowledge sharing due to agglomeration economy) than City 1. In the Rosen-Roback model, the horizontal axis measures the wage level, and the vertical axis measures the rent for housing/office. Please determine the true or false of the following statements: (5 pts) Higher amenities for households and firms in City 2 lead to the wage in City 2, W2, always higher than W1 in City 1.

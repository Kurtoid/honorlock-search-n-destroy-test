FULL SOLUTION PROBLEM:  Answer the question here (enter the answers in the text box), but you must submit a full solution including Given, Find, EQU, all mathematical steps, and include units.  Work on this problem should be submitted to the Test #3 work submission link on Canvas Text #3 Module no more than 15 minutes after the completion of this Quiz. Collision in one Dimension Elastic Collision - Momentum Consideration Consider the blocks on the curved ramp as seen in the figure below. The blocks have masses m1= 2.50 kg and m2 = 4.25 kg and are initially at rest. The blocks are allowed to slide down the ramp and they then undergo a head-on, elastic collision on the flat portion. Assume the ramp is frictionless, and h = 5.50 m, answer the following questions.    (a) Calculate the velocity of m1 just before and just after the collision. (1.5 pt) (b) Calculate the velocity of m2 just before and just after the collision. (1.5 pt) (c) Determine the heights (in m) to which m1 and m2 rise on the curved portion of the ramp after the collision. (2 pt)

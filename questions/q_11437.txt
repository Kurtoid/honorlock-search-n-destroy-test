Condominium measurements are taken from:
1. A Rankine steam plant operates with a closed feedwater heater (CFWH).  Steam exits the boiler at 600degC and 20.0 bar.  The steam exits the High Pressure turbine at 5.0 bar.  Some of the steam is extracted and goes to the CFWH. the rest of the steam goes to the Low Pressure turbine.  The extracted steam preheats the feedwater, then is throttled into the condenser.  The steam exits the Low Pressure turbine at the condenser pressure of 0.70 bar.  The pump is ideal, the turbines have an efficiency of 85%. The table provides some of the properties that you will need. You DON'T need to fill in EVERY blank in the table.         d. Determine the thermal efficiency of the cycle, in percent.

Perform the following tasks.   Open the data file associated with this test in Canvas. Save the workbook using the file name Catered Delights Weekly Payroll Report Complete. Apply the Vapor Trail theme to the worksheet. Calculate the gross pay using a conditional ("IF") formula. If the number of hours worked in a week is less than 35, then the gross pay is the product of the hourly rate and the number of hours worked. If the number of hours worked exceeds 35, then the hours up to 35 are compensated at the regular rate (pay rate times hours worked) and hours exceeding 35 are compensated at 1.5 times the regular rate. The same formula must be used for all cells in the Gross Pay column. Use formulas to calculate the Average, Highest and Lowest amounts for Gross Pay only. Delete column B. Set column A width to 31.00 and columns B through K to 11.00. Select row 3 and set text to wrap in this row. Then set the row height to best fit. Delete the record for the employee Evans, Timothy. Add two blank lines directly above the row for Mi, Emily, and add the information for the two new employees listed in the table below.      Employee   Withholding Allowances   Rate per Hour   Hours  Worked     James, Michael   1   $23.00   32.5     Lindstrom, Ashley   0   $18.00   48      Copy the gross pay formula to the rows of the two new employees. Add the tax rates below starting in cell A19 in your worksheet. Do not draw any borders at this time.      Tax Rates         Social Security tax   6.20%     Medicare tax   1.45%     Federal tax under $818   14.0%     Federal tax on $818 and higher   24.0%     State tax (% of federal withholding)   19.5%      Change the font size in cell A1 to 28-point. Change the font size in cell A2 to 18-point. Change the font in cell A19 to 18-point italic and underlined. Change the row height for rows 1, 2, and 19 to best fit. Insert three columns to the right of the Gross Pay column and add the column titles Taxable Income, Social Security, and Medicare. Center the contents of cells B3:K3. Calculate the Social Security and Medicare taxes by multiplying the tax rates in the Tax Rates table by the gross pay.   Federal tax calculations must take into account two tiers of income tax, which are applied to the taxable income. Calculate the taxable income, which is the gross pay minus (number of withholding allowances x $103). Calculate the federal tax withheld. If an employee has a taxable income of greater than or equal to $818, then the federal tax withheld equals $110.85 plus the federal tax rate found in cell B23 multiplied by the taxable income in excess of $818. If an employee's taxable income is $818 or less, the federal tax withheld equals the taxable income multiplied by the federal tax rate found in cell B22. Use a conditional ("IF") function to calculate the federal tax in Column I. State tax is calculated as a percentage of federal tax. Use the tax rate in the Tax Rates table to calculate state tax in column J. Calculate Net Pay in column K, as Gross Pay minus Social Security, Medicare, Federal Tax, and State Tax. Calculate column totals from Hours Worked to Net Pay. Use the background color Gold, Accent 3, Lighter 40% (column 7, row 4) for the ranges A1:K2 and A19:B24. Center the range B4:B11. Apply the currency style with two decimal places, no dollar signs, and negative numbers in black and parentheses to the range C4:C11 and E5:K11. Apply the same currency style but with dollar signs to the first row and total row of every column that contains dollar amounts. Do the same (i.e., with dollar signs) to the Average, Highest, and Lowest Gross Pay amounts. Apply a Thick Bottom Border to the range A3:K3. Apply the Total cell style to the range A12:K12. Apply a Thick Outside Border to the range A19:B24. Change the sheet tab name to Weekly Payroll and the tab color to match the color used as background color in cell A1. Preview the worksheet. Fit the printout of the worksheet on one page in landscape orientation. Save the workbook again. Upload the completed workbook to Canvas in Excel format.

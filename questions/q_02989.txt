This problem has 5 multiple choice parts to it. All apply to the situation and picture given below. Pay attention to the options that are given to you for each part as they may change from part to part. Consider a conducting, cubic shell centered at the point O{"version":"1.1","math":"O"}, a conducting spherical shell centered at point S{"version":"1.1","math":"S"} and a spherical cavity within this spherical shell centered at the point P{"version":"1.1","math":"P"}. The cubic shell has a charge Qc=0{"version":"1.1","math":"Qc=0"}, the spherical shell has a charge Qs=-2{"version":"1.1","math":"Qs=-2"} and there is a point charge q=-2{"version":"1.1","math":"q=-2"} at the point P{"version":"1.1","math":"P"}. Notice that the center of the sphere is not at the center of the cube, and the center of the cavity (where the point charge is) is not at the center of the sphere. A picture below may help.  Part (a) How much charge builds up on the outside surface of the sphere? ( 3 points)  Your options are -4, -2, 0, 2, and 4 Part (b) How much charge builds up on the outside surface of the cube? ( 3 points)  Your options are -4, -2, 0, 2, and 4 Part (c) Which surface of the cube has the greatest magnitude of charge density? (3 points) Your options are: Inside surface, Outside surface, They are the same, It is impossible to tell. For parts (d) and (e) assume that the cube has been removed and you only have the sphere and the point charge. You need to match the blanks with the correct choice. In each part the first blank is worth 2 points and the second blank is worth 1 point. Options for Blank 1: Towards, Away From Options for Blank 2: P, S, O{"version":"1.1","math":"P, S, O"} (1d) The direction of the electric field inside the cavity can be described as __________ the point __________. (1e) The direction of the electric field outside the sphere can be described as __________ the point __________.

Suppose that the amount of time that it takes a clerk to process an employment application is uniformly distributed between 5 and 12 minutes. What is the probability that the clerk will take exactly 7 minutes to process a randomly selected application? (Hint: Remember that you are dealing with a continuous distribution in this case since we are looking at minutes.)

Recall an example discussed in lecture and in your textbook towards the beginning of the semester: Imagine you are a shepherd who grazes twenty sheep on a village common. Along with your pan pipes and bag lunch, you herd your flock to the common every day. So long as the number of sheep on the common remains small, the grass remains plentiful and the sheep contentedly munch away. Assume, though, that shepherds from over the mountain have heard of the wonderful grass in the common and bring their flocks. With each hour these sheep graze, there is less grass available for future grazing. In fact, you soon realized that this increased level of grazing will soon nibble the grass down to the roots, with the result of not enough forage in the future for anyone's flock, including your own. Yet you and the other shepherds will likely continue to allow your sheep to overgraze. Below are several variations in how the government might regulate this problem. Each example represents one of the five options in the Regulatory Toolkit. Match each example with the approach it most closely represents.

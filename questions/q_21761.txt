Let the function f : N - R be defined recursively as follows:      Initial Condition:  f (0) = 18Recursive Part:  f (n + 1) = 1/9 * f (n), for n > 0 Consider how to prove the following statement about this given function f using induction. For all nonnegative integers n, f (n) = 2/9(n-1). Select the best response for each question below about how this proof by induction should be done.  Q1.  Which of the following would be a correct Basis step for this proof?   [Basis] A.  For n = 0, f(n) = f(0) = 18; also 2/9(n-1) = 2/9-1 = 2*9 = 18, so f(n) = 2/9(n-1) for n = 0. B.  For n = k, assume f(k) = 2/9(k-1) for some integer k >= 0, so f(n) = 2/9(n-1) for n = k. C.  For n = k+1, f(k+1) = 2/9(k+1-1) when f(k) = 2/9(k-1) for some integer k >= 0, so f(n) = 2/9(n-1) for n = k+1. D.  For n = 1, f(n) = f(1) = 1/9*f(0) = 1/9*18 = 2; also 2/9(n-1) = 2/90 = 2, so f(n) = 3n for n = 1. Q2.  Which of the following would be a correct Inductive Hypothesis for this proof?   [InductiveHypothesis] A.  Prove f(k) = 2/9(k-1) for some integer k >= 0. B.  Assume f(k+1) = 2/9(k) when f(k) = 2/9(k-1) for some integer k >= 0. C.  Prove f(k) = 2/9(k-1) for all integers k >= 0. D.  Assume f(k) = 2/9(k-1) for some integer k >= 0. Q3.  Which of the following would be a correct completion of the Inductive Step for this proof?   [InductiveStep] A.  f(k+1) = 1/9*f(k), which confirms the recursive part of the definition. B.  When the inductive hypothesis is true, f(k+1) = 1/9*f(k) = 1/9*2/9(k-1) = 2/9(k-1)+1 = 2/9(k) = 2/9(k+1)-1 C.  When the inductive hypothesis is true, f(k+1) = 2/9(k) = 2/9(k+1)-1 = 1/9*2/9(k-1) = 1/9*f(k), which confirms the recursive part of the definition. D.  When f(k+1) = 2/9(k+1)-1 = 2/9(k) = 1/9*2/9(k-1); also f(k+1) = 1/9*f(k), so f(k) = 2/9(k-1), confirming the induction hypothesis. Q4.  Which of the following would be a correct conclusion for this proof?   [Conclusion] A.  By the principle of mathematical induction, f(n+1) =1/9* f(n) for all integers n >= 0. B.  By the principle of mathematical induction, f(k) = f(k+1) for all integers k >= 0. C.  By the principle of mathematical induction, f(n) = 2/9(n-1) for all integers n >= 0. D.  By the principle of mathematical induction, f(k) = 2/9(k-1) implies f(k+1) = 2/9(k) for all integers k >= 0.

Assume the ambient temperature is 300 K.  The pieces of a silicon MOS capacitor consists of the following materials along with their parameters listed below: Metal: aluminum (work function = 4.1 eV), Oxide: Zirconium dioxide (dielectric constant =32.6; Electron affinity = 2.0 eV, bandgap energy = 5.7 eV, thickness (tox) = 10 nm)  (FYI, this is the material used as the "high-K dielectric" in advanced CMOS to extended the Moore's law.) Semiconductor: silicon (dielectric constant = 11.9, electron affinity = 4.05 eV, bandgap energy = 1.12 eV, work function = 4.95 eV, ni = 1010 cm -3) Individual section of these three pieces of materials is shown schematically below.

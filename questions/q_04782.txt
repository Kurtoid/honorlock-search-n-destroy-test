You intend to generate a transgenic Drosophila strain that expresses the gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a protein from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria that glows bright green.  You have inserted the GFP gene into a P element DNA transposon.  The full transgene is shown below.    A) Your next step is to insert this transgene into a small circular piece of DNA from bacteria. What is this DNA circle called?   B) In order to insert your transgene into the DNA circle, you first need to cut the circle with a restriction enzyme. Explain what a restriction enzyme is and how it works (as discussed in class).   C) When you inject your DNA circle into Drosophila embryos, you also have to inject an additional, "helper" DNA circle. What is on this helper molecule, and why is it important?

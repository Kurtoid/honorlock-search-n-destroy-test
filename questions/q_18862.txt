The study vignette relates to questions 31-32. Two social work faculty developed a secondary prevention program for families with a known history of maltreatment; it involves bi-weekly home visits by a social worker who is trained in family systems interventions. These faculty, in collaboration from allies in the Department of Children and Families lobbied long and hard to secure State funding for a demonstration project using this program. The program developers were designated as the evaluators, and because this is a program evaluation, it was exempt from IRB review. Families were informed about the evaluation and asked to participate without going into detail about potential harms, benefits, or privacy of data. The expectation was that the program would show a significant reduction in reported child abuse incidents. Instead, the results showed a slight but significant increase in reported child abuse incidents and a higher rate of re-opened CPS cases among participating families within the first 3 years (using CPS administrative data). The investigators were perplexed and very concerned about withdrawal of State funding for this program. An evaluation report to the funder portrayed the program in a favorable light by highlighting program satisfaction as well as qualitative input from some of the program participants. The findings regarding the impact of the program in terms of reported child abuse incidents were included but the report cast doubts about the credibility of these findings, pointing to (minor) problems with the evaluation methods. -------------------------------------------------------------- Based on the information provided, the investigators may be committing the error of:

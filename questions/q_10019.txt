To acidify the lumen of lysosomes (compartments in the cell involved in breakdown and recycling of biomolecules), V-type ATPase transporters are used to pump protons (H+) into the lumen (interior) of the lysosome. If the pH of the inside of the cell (cytosol) is 7.4 (4 x 10-8 M H+) and the luminal pH of the lysosome is 4.0 (1 x 10-4 M H+), calculate the free energy for a mole of protons (H+) to be pumped from the cytosol into the lumen of the lysosome. Note: We can consider, when determining membrane potential, that the movement of a solute molecule from the cytosol into the lumen of a lysosome is the same as movement from the inside of the cell to outside the cell. Assume: DGt = RT ln(C2/C1) or DGt = RT ln(C2/C1) + Z FDps T= 310 K R= 8.315 J/mol*K F= 96,480 J/mol*V (Faraday's constant) Dps = -50 mV (membrane potential, inside)

In the 5W model of customer analysis, what is the primary emphasis of the "What" question?
Which point represents the ordered pair ?
The owner of a small but growing business, Terry Franklin was becoming overwhelmed with requests from his outside customer service representatives for decisions about solutions to customer problems. Noting the mountain of his own work that was piling up, he instituted a policy change and informed the representatives. "Keep the customers happy," he said. "If it's a problem that takes less than $100.00 to fix, there's no need to call me. Use your judgment and go ahead and fix it." Terry Franklin is using empowerment to narrow provider ________ of the gaps model of service quality.
In the Classical period, opera began to reflect human emotion more realistically. This led to the development of lighter operas called ________.
In comparison to other mammals, very few behaviors/neural systems have critical windows for development in humans.
Group Design Choice 2 of 2 As the most frequent human chromosomal abnormality (i.e., trisomy of Chromosome 21), Down syndrome occurs in approximately 1.5 per 1,000 live births.     A. Generally speaking, what are the reading difficulties of children with Down syndrome? Where can the reading difficulties be traced to?   B. List ONE effective reading instructional strategy for children with Down syndrome.   C. You aim to compare the effectiveness of this strategy for children with Down syndrome to the effectiveness for children with William syndrome. Design an intervention study to address this research aim.     Describe the participants in your overall sample and the sub-sample groups. What are three independent variables (including covariates) you will measure? Why and how will you collect data on those independent variables? What are two dependent variables you will measure? Why and how will you collect data on those dependent variables? Describe the group-level research design you will use, including when you will collect data on each of the variables above, and how your design addresses issues of validity. Write two testable research questions for your study. Your research questions should explicitly address the research aim.  Be sure that you have referred to each of the independent and dependent variables somewhere in the research questions. For each research question, describe the statistical analysis you will perform to test the research question. Be clear about how you will include each of your variables as part of the statistical analysis.

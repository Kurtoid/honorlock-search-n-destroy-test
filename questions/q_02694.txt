The __________________________________ technique begins when a person first makes a small, trivial request. Because the request is easy to comply with, the likelihood that the target of the request will comply is high. Later, though, the target is asked to comply with a significantly larger request. It turns out that compliance with the second request increases substantially when the target has first agreed to the initial, smaller request.

In the pancreatic b cells, glucokinase (similar to liver enzyme, high Km, high Vmax) participates in the b cells functioning as a glucose sensor (these cells respond to high blood glucose levels by releasing insulin). Glucose, imported into the b cells by the GLUT2 transporter, is metabolized through the glycolytic pathway to produce ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. The ATP produced binds to an ATP-dependent K+ channel leading to depolarization of the b cells and insulin release. If the b cell glucokinase is similar to the liver glucokinase, which of the following characteristics of glucokinase will also contribute to glucose sensing by the b cells?

A freight train consists of engines (mengine=100,000 kg) and cars (mcar=50,000 kg). Each engine is capable of exerting 5.00 x 105 N force on the track to accelerate the train forward. Assuming that the train is composed of 2 engines and 30 cars, what is the force of kinetic friction (in Newtons) acting on the train while the train is going up a hill with a 15o incline? Ignore the force of drag.  Useful information about trains: The static friction coefficient between the train and the tracks is

You are hired at Google to work in their Mountain View, California office. Your first task involves making the office run more efficiently. One big issue plaguing the company is parking. Property values in Mountain View are sky high, meaning that purchasing additional land for employee parking is incredibly expensive. In addition, it is inefficient (which is why Google offers employee free bus transportation throughout the Bay Area). You decide to see just how great the demand is for more parking on the Google campus by sending out a survey asking fellow Googlers  "How much would you be willing to pay to double the amount of parking on campus?" Based on their responses,you estimated that your fellow Googlers were collectively willing to pay $12 million to double the amount of on-campus parking, an undertaking that would cost approximately $50 million.

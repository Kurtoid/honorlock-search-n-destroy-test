Iron is body centered cubic (BCC) material, which has the favorable slip system {110}.  The critical resolved shear stress is 27.5 MPa. (a) An engineer is doing tensile test on a single crystal iron.  The stress of 35 MPa is applied along [001] direction. (a-1) please calculate the resolved shear stress of the slip along    (a-2) determine whether the dislocation slip will take place.   (b) If this engineer performs the tensile test along [001] direction on single crystal iron, (b-1) draw the general look of the stress-strain curve; (b-2) explain the mechanistic causes of the different stages; (b-3) explain how temperature affects these stages; (b-4) explain how stacking fault energy affects these stages; (b-5) If multiple slip systems were activated, how does the stress-strain curve look like?

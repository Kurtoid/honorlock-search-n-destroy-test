Heading Up Shore Tegula funebralis is a snail found on Californian shores. Researcher Michael Fawcett noticed that snails in southern California were usually found living higher on rocks while northern California populations lived in deeper waters. Food was more abundant in deeper waters, so Fawcett wondered why southern Californian snail populations chose a different lifestyle. He found that there were a great number of predators in the deeper waters of southern California and hypothesized that this explained the difference in populations. To test this, he transplanted both populations to deeper waters with similar predators and observed what happened. Southern California snails moved quickly back up to higher rocks while northern California snails did not. Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 46-50. 46. The ability to escape predators by adapting to life higher on shore rocks likely conferred a reproductive advantage for southern California snails.

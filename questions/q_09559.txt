Peck asserts that the process of meeting and solving life's problems gives us:
Consider the problem of displaying a pattern of asterisks that form a triangle of height h, as shown below for h = 4: * ** *** **** *** ** * The problem can be solved with the recursive helper method shape below.  The method takes two parameters: low and high.  It first prints a row of asterisks corresponding to parameter low.  If high is higher than low, it recursively generates a shape in which low is incremented by one, and then prints another row of low asterisks.  Select a statement to complete method triangle, so that the helper method shape is invoked with the correct arguments in order to display a triangle with parameter height. public static void shape(int low, int high) {  if (high >= low)  {  asterisksRow(low);  if (high > low)  {  shape(low + 1, high);  asterisksRow(low);  }  } }  public static void asterisksRow(int n) // Method to display a row of n stars  {  for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j)  {  System.out.print("*");  }    System.out.println("*"); }   public static void triangle(int height) {  if (height > 1)  {  _______________________  } }

Researchers are studying the average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline across   the country. Last year at this time, the average price at all stations nationwide was $3.17  per gallon, but this year, a random sample of 67 stations had an average price of $3.09  per gallon, with a standard deviation of $0.28 per gallon. These researchers would like to test that the average price at all stations nationwide is lower now than it was last year.  What alternative hypothesis should the researchers use to test their claim?

Select any ten of the problems numbered 13 to 26 and solve them.  If you attempt more than 10, clearly indicate which I am to grade.   There has been a break in the dam and it will take 40 tons of sand to stop the flow of water.  A dump truck picks up 12 tons of sand, drives to the site of the break, and dumps in its load.  Then it returns to the place it picks up sand and repeats the process.  Unfortunately, by the time the truck returns the water has washed away 8 tons of sand.  Undaunted, the trucker continues to go back and forth until the required 40 tons blocks the flow.  How many trips does the truck make?

In the reaction 2Al(s) + 3I2(s) - 2AlI3(s), the theoretical yield of the product is 12 g. When a student performed this reaction in his lab, he could obtain just 3 g of the product. Calculate the percent yield. Molar mass AlI3 = 407.6935 g AlI3/mol AlI3. STATE JUST YOUR ANSWER INCLUDING UNITS IN THE TEXT BOX BELOW.

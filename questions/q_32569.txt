Emma has created a model with six predictors (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 , x6). She has 60 observations. She found the following ANOVA table.      DF Sum of Squares Mean Sq F p-value   x1     0.002   x2     0.003   x3     0.004   x4   401  0.65   x5   300  0.26   x6   254  0.25   Residuals  [SSEfull]       She would like to remove the last three variables (x4, x5, x6) all at one time, so she ran the model with only the first three variables  (x1, x2, x3).      DF Sum of Squares Mean Sq F p-value   x1     0.001   x2     0.002   x2     0.75   Residuals  [SSEr]       Find the F test statistic to determine if she can remove all three variables.  Round your answer to one decimal place.

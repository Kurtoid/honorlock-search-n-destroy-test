You are given a function that implements binary search and has the header: int bSearch(int arr[], int target) This function searches the target in an array and returns the index of the target or -1 if target is not in the array. Example: bSearch( {1, 2, 3, 4}, 4) returns 3 and bSearch( {1, 2, 3, 4}, 5) returns -1. What will be the return value of this function for the following function call: bSearch( {100, 2, 2, 2, 8, 6, 7, 11, 14, 25, 33}, 8)

According to the CIA World Factbook, Singapore has a GDP per capita of $98,000 per person (5th highest in the world).  For comparison, South Korea has a GDP per capita of about $43,000 (ranked 41st globally).  [Note: these figures are provided in terms of purchasing power parity, meaning converted to spending power in U.S. dollars.]  Thus, these statistics might lead one to believe that people in Singapore have, on average, a standard of living that is more than "twice as nice" as the standard of living in South Korea. A couple of other interesting statistics: the proportion of the population living below the poverty line in Singapore is 20.2%, while that figure is 14.4% in South Korea.  The Gini index for each country is: Singapore=46.2 and South Korea=34.8. Ignoring anything else you might know about these two countries other than the statistics cited above, answer the following 3 questions: 1) You are hired by each nation's government to reduce absolute poverty.  To understand the degree of absolute poverty in each country, what other information would you need to know? 2) If each country were to look at relative poverty (as opposed to absolute), how would they do that?  Which country would appear poorer under a relative poverty measure? Explain why. 3) Which country do you predict has a greater degree of intergenerational mobility?  Explain your answer.

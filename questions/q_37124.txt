(For all students) A top view of a model of a towed trailer is shown in the figure below. The trailer is being towed at a constant velocity V. F represents a tire force which is here always perpendicular to the trailer. The trailer is modeled as a point mass located a distance d along a light (massless) rod of length h. Use coordinates y, the location of the pivot point, and q, the angular deflection of the trailer.  Find the velocity of point O. Find the velocity of mass m. Find the velocity of the point of application of the force F. Find the virtual work dW done by the force F. Find the generalized forces Q y and Q q associated with the force F.

The sugar molecule D-allose can exist in an open-chain and a ring form (referred to as D-allopyranose, shown below). When the open chain form of D-allose is converted to the ring form, a new chiral center (referred to as the anomeric carbon) is formed. This produces two stereoisomers: the a-anomer and the b-anomer of D-allopyranose (shown below).  In the LEAST stable chair form of D-allopyranose, would the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) group be axial or equatorial? You can disregard the anomeric OH group to answer this question. [axeq] Which of the two anomers of D-allopyranose is MORE stable? Note that the more stable anomer can assume the more stable chair conformation. [stableanomer] Which of the following options best describes the isomeric relationship between the two anomers of D-allopyranose? [relationship]

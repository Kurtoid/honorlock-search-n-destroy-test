The following is a list of the events that occur during a muscle contraction. The correct order for these events is:  The pre-energized myosin heads bind to the exposed active sites on actin The freed myosin heads hydrolyze ATP to ADP + Pi and return to the energized/ cocked position Calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum The myosin heads pivot towards the center of the sarcomere (power stroke) Calcium ions binds to troponin, causing the troponin-tropomyosin complex to change shape New ATP molecules bind to the myosin heads and this breaks the cross-bridge link

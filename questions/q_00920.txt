Question Part 3: Bonus question, worth 5 points added to your final score. There are two parts to this question; answer both parts to get full credit. Copper is a very important element used in industry and in our daily use at home in electronics/communications/cookware and in our automobiles. But copper has a very low abundance in/on earth and thus we could run out if substitutes are not found. 1. The resource amount (total in earth) of copper is 6,000,000 million metric tons; assume that the economically viable reserve amount of copper using current extraction methods is 600 million metric tons and the annual production amount is 20 million metric tons per year. Calculate, or set up the calculation, the current copper depletion time (in years) under current extraction/mining methods. 2. Name two substitute materials we use in relatively large quantities that will extend your calculated depletion time for the reserve amount copper.

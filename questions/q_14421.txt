VRAAG 3     'n Man staan op die brug, wat 15m bokant die grond is, met 'n bal in sy hand, reg om dit opwaarts te gooi. Sodra die man wat na hom toe beweeg, 20m van hom af is, gooi hy die bal regop in die lug in oor die reeling van die brug.     3.1   Bereken die beginsnelheid van die bal indien dit die bal 0,3 s neem om die maksimum hoogte te bereik. Neem afwaarts as positief.   (3)         'n Bal word laat val van 'n hoogte van 0,9 m bokant die horisontale oppervlakte. Neem af as positief vir alle berekeninge.         3.2   Bewys dat die spoed van die bal 4,2 m.s-1 is wanneer dit die oppervlakte bereik.   (2)     3.3   Verduidelik die verskil tussen vryval en projektielbeweging.   (3)     3.4   Sodra die bal die oppervlakte bereik, bons dit opwaarts. Die effek van die bons is om die spoed met twee derdes van die waarde in Vraag 3.2 te verminder. Bereken die verandering in snelheid gedurende die botsing.   (3)     3.5   Die bal neem 0,43 sekondes om die oppervlakte te bereik. Teken 'n sketsgrafiek om die snelheid van die bal voor te stel vanaf die oomblik wat dit laat val word totdat dit die maksimum hoogte bereik na die eerste bons. Aanvaar dat die tyd van die bons weglaatbaar is. Toon alle berekeninge en dui alle belangrike waardes op die grafiek aan.   (6)             [17]

Many songbirds breed in North America in the spring and summer, and then migrate to Central and South America in the fall. They spend the winter in these warmer areas where they feed and prepare for the spring migration north and another breeding season.

In spring, species X goes to the east coast of North America, and species Y goes to the west coast. Which of the following factors most likely keeps these species separate?

Oftentimes when we measure the positions or velocities of an object at different points in time, it is helpful to visualize the data graphically as a function of time, as a velocity or position versus time graph. Or, we will see data that someone else has taken (perhaps in a homework or quiz question...) presented in this form.   Consider the following scenarios, draw a picture if the data points are provided, and fill in the blanks accordingly.    a) On a position versus time (x versus t) graph, you see that between t = 0 s and t = 5 s, the positions x = 55 m and x = 0 m are connected by a straight line. This means that the average x-velocity component is [aBlank] (don't forget units!).   b) Now, you look at a different set of data; in this data set, the velocity along the x-axis is plotted versus time. At t = 0 s, the velocity component is 5 m/s; it is connected by a straight line to t = 10 s, where it has a velocity component of 20 m/s. The value of the acceleration along that axis is [bBlank] (don't forget units!)   c) Now, some more data is added to the data set of part (c): there is another line connecting the last data point at t = 10 s and vx = 20 m/s to t = 15 s, vx = 20 m/s. The value of the acceleration in that last region is [cBlank1], and the total distance travelled between t = 0 s and t = 15 s is [cBlank2] (don't forget units!)

Read the passage and answer the question that follows. 1Several types of instructional approaches can be used to help children explore, learn, and use oral language in the preschool years. 2These approaches can be used in a variety of early childhood settings--from pre-kindergartens to child-care centers to home-based care. 3Equally effective with whole and small groups of children as well as individual children, they can be divided into the following types: Shared book reading, Songs rhymes and word play, Storytelling, Circle time, and Dramatic play. -adapted from "Joining Oral Language and Early Literacy," published by www.reading.org    Which sentence is the topic sentence?

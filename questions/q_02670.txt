A "Contour Line" is defined in the textbook as "a line made up of points of same elevations". Google defines a contour line as "a line on a map joining points of equal height above or below sea level". Given a contour map with the contour lines as shown below, you went out and did a level loop to verify the elevation of point "X",  You determine that the ground has an elevation of 33.34 at point X. You verify that the elevation at the top left property corner is exactly as shown below! Please explain the 7 reasons why the elevation at point X from your survey could be so different from the contour line shown on the contour map prepared by a licensed surveyor.  Please note you hade a 0.01 Loop Error.   Based on this LE which of the seven reasons would be the most and least likely to explain this issue?

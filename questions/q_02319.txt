A patient is complaining of severe anxiety. He becomes so anxious that at times his thinking is disorganized and he feels absolute terror and helplessness. His heart races, his hands become diaphoretic; he feels so short of breath that he throws open the window or runs outside to breathe. At times like this, he feels like he is going to die. The patient is describing which of the following?
Answer 4 of the following 6 questions:  A: Describe the differences between alpha and gamma motor neurons. Describe and compare their anatomical connections within a muscle. What are their relative functional roles? (2-3 sentences) B: The basal ganglia contains two different pathways (direct and indirect) that contain disinhibitory circuits. Describe the brain areas involved in the direct pathway and what their net impact is within the circuit (i.e., excitation or inhibition). What is the impact of stimulation of increased drive onto the direct pathway? What part of the basal ganglia (direct pathway) is altered in Parkinson's disease, and how does this alter the circuit?  C: Describe at least two kinds of experimental evidence that the premotor area (Area 6) is important for motor planning. The descriptions should include both the experiment as well as the physiological response.  D: Compare and contrast the control of the hypothalamus by the anterior and posterior pituitary. Be explicit with respect to the connections from the hypothalamus, and which chemicals are released (at least 1 each from the posterior and anterior). E: Explain how volumetric thirst is triggered (volumetric referring to changes in blood volume, not changes in concentration of blood solutes). Describe the mechanism by which it is detected, and the signaling circuits and pathways involved.  F: Describe how elevated leptin alters processing in the brain. The answer should include details with respect to which neurons are activated, their projection targets, and the different roles of those projections (i.e., humoral, visceromotor and somatic responses).

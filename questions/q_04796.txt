Reading Selection Three   The world's largest pile of scrap tires is not visible from Interstate 5, in Stanislaus County, California. However, it's close. Below Stockton, in the region of Modesto and Merced, the highway follows the extreme western edge of the flat Great Central Valley, right next to the scrap where the Coast Ranges are territorially expanding as fresh unpopulated hills. The Joaquin County line and make your way on foot southwest one mile, you would climb into steeply creased terrain that in winter is jade green and in summer straw brown, and, any time at all, you would come upon a black vista.  At best on sloping ground, the tires are so deep that they form their own topography -- their own escarpments, their own overhanging cliffs.Deposited from a ridge line, they border a valley for nearly half a mile. When you first glimpse them, you are not sure what they are. From the high ground on the opposite side, the individual tires appear to be grains of black sand. They look like little egg stones -- oolites each a bright yolk ringed in black pearl. Close to them, you walk in tire canyons. In some places, they are piled six stories high, compressing themselves at the bottom, - pucks.  From the highest elevations of this thick and drifted black mantle, you can look east a hundred miles and see snow on the Sierra.   The tires are from all sides of the bays of San Francisco and up and down the Great Central Valley from Bakersfield to Sacramento. Even before the interstate was there, a tire jockey named Ed Filbin began collecting them -- charging dealers and gas stations "tipping fees" of so much per passenger tire and so much per truck tire, as tire jockeys everywhere do. This was long before people began to worry, with regard to used tires, about mosquitoes,fires, landfills, and compounding environmental concerns, or to look upon old tires as a resource.  Filbin's pile just grew, and he made enough money to diversify, becoming, as he is today, the largest sheep rancher in Nevada. Meanwhile, his tire ranch near Modesto continued to broaden and thicken, until no one, including Filbin, knew how many tires were there.  Eventually, the state took notice then county zoning authorities, and Filbin felt harassed. When I called him one day in Nevada, he sketched these people as "dirty rotten bureaucrats" and said, "I told them to go jump in a crick. I had grandfather rights."  With those words, he cradled his telephone, refusing to say more.

Part B - Preparing the testing area Taking the time to set up your testing environment before logging into the exam will not only help to prevent Honorlock violations but will also generate an environment more conducive performing well on the exam.

You must secure a quiet, private setting where there will be no disturbances while taking the examination.  All entertainment devices must be turned off during the exam.  2. Sit at a clean desk or table (not on a bed or couch).    Ensure that all notes, books, and digital devices are out of sight during the exam. Put away all items that may even appear to be digital devices, including watches. Remember that these are closed-book exams and the use of any materials or assistance during the exam is academic dishonesty. Ensure that meeting this requirement is noted during your room scan.    3. Align the keyboard, computer monitor and webcam. You must always be facing the webcam during the exam. Check that the webcam is positioned so that your full face is visible, in the middle of the screen.    Ensure that the room is well-lit, so your face is clearly visible throughout the exam. The source of light should not be behind the student.  Avoid pointing the webcam at a window during the exam, and close curtains or blinds on all windows in the room where taking the exam and close doors     4.

If you have a second monitor, turn it so that the screen is not visible from the testing area. 8. Ensure that the room is well-lit. Your face and environment need to be clearly seen. Adequate lighting must be used so that your face is clearly visible for the entire assessment. Make sure your face is being illuminated from the front, not the back. Ensure that this is noted during your room scan. 9. Remember that these are closed-notes exams and the use of any materials or assistance during the exam is academic dishonesty and can result in point deductions and/or submission of an academic dishonesty report.

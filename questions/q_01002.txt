A forward bias (electrical potential) of V = 0.10 volt is applied to a pn junction (semiconductor diode) at room temperature (300 K). This causes an electric current of [current] milliamperes (1 mA = 10-3 A) to flow. The forward bias is increased to V = [V2] volts.  At this voltage, what is the current through the junction? Give your answer in amperes (A).   Useful facts:   hc = 1.2398 x 10-6 eV m kB = 8.617333262x10-5 eV/K 1 eV = 1.6022x10-19 J

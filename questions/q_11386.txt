Use the reading passage and diagram below to help you answer questions 17-19. The Formation of CoalCoal is an important rock because one of its properties is that it burns.  Coal provides energy for industries and for the production of electricity.  Much of the country's best coal is found in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama.  The formation of this large coal field began about 300 million years ago during the time geologists call the Carboniferous Period.  During this period, vast tropical swamp forests covered much of North America.  When these ancient trees died, they fell into the swamp water, which was low on oxygen.  Instead of rotting--as they would in an oxygen-rich environment--the dead vegetation piled up.  The sequence of pictures below tells the rest of the story of how this plant matter became coal.

Write the net ionic equation for the reaction of aqueous chromium (III) nitrate with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate.
**Note: you will use this same artificial cell scenario for the next four questions. Imagine an artificial cell that is composed of a selectively permeable membrane.  The interior of the cell contains an aqueous solution (meaning water is the solvent) consisting of 4M galactose, 1M carbonate, and 0.00001M hydrogen ions.   This 'artificial cell' is immersed in a beaker containing a different solution. The solution in the beaker consists of 2 M galactose + 0.001M hydrogen ions (and again, water is the solvent).  The membrane is permeable to water and to small molecules such as galactose and hydrogen ions, but it is not permeable to larger ions such as carbonate.
As the concentration of a solute in a solution increases, the freezing point of the solution __________ and the vapor pressure of the solution __________.

Immigration has become a polarizing topic in the United States for the past several years. Specifically, Latinx refugees have been migrating into the US seeking asylum and better lives from their own countries where they face kidnapping, human trafficking, and murder. Recently, Latinx children have been crossing the U.S./Mexico border in droves, yet the United States government has been under fire for not finding appropriate accommodation for these refugees or for not deporting them in a timely manner after they arrive.  Make an argument for your view on Latinx undocumented immigrants coming into the U.S. State your position followed by convincing reasons. Finally, what action can the U.S. take to begin unpacking this tough issue?

In the multiple choice problems, "NOTA" means "None Of The Above". 1a.  (4 pts) For power method, which of the following statements is true: (A)  Power method can be used to find all eigenvalues of a given matrix. (B)  Power method can be used to find complex eigenvalues for a real valued matrix. (C)  Power method is suited for finding the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude of a sparse matrix.  (D) Power method cannot be used to find negative eigenvalues because the norm is always positive. (E) NOTA.   1b. (4pts) Which of the following statement regarding numerical integration is true: (A) Composite trapezoidal rule of integration is 2nd order accurate and the integration is exact only for a polynomial of degree 1 or less. (B) In deriving Simpson's 1/3 rule, since the underlying function is approximated by a polynomial of degree 2, Simpson's 1/3 rule is thus 3rd order accurate. (C)  Romberg method is not recommended because it is computationally too intensive. (D) NOTA   1c. (4pts) Which of the following statements about linear regression is NOT true: (A)  It can only fit the data using the function in the form of y=a+bx. It cannot be used for any nonlinear functions. (B)  The standard error of the estimate for a linear regression is given by for n data points in which Sr is the sum of squares of the residuals with respect to the regression line. (C) If the coefficient of determination r2 equals to 1 for the given n data points, all data go through the same straight line. (D) NOTA   1d. (2pts) True or False: Linear dependence among 4 vectors of the same dimension means that at least one of the vectors can be represented by a linear combination of the other 3 vectors. 1e. (2pts) True or False:  For a given set of data, Lagrange method and Newton's divided difference method will give identical polynomial if the degree of polynomial is the same. 1f. (2pts) True or False: Simpson's 3/8 rule is more accurate than Simpson's 1/3 rule because the 3/8 rule results from the use of a 3rd order interpolating polynomial to approximate the underlying function while the 1/3 rule results from the use of a 2nd order polynomial. 1g. (2pts) True or False: "Spline" method uses piecewise low-order polynomials to perform interpolation.      (10 pts) For three vectors u, v, & w given below, determine if they are linearly dependent:                          u=(1, 2, 3)                         v=(4, 5, 6)                         w=(7, 8, 9).    For the matrix A given below,   A=

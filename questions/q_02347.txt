Serial dilutions are made from a broth culture of Shewanella putrefaciens in order to determine the number of bacteria in the culture.  Following the dilution series, 0.1 ml of the 10-7 dilution tube is plated on Plate A, 0.1 ml of the 10-8 dilution tube is plated on Plate B.  RESULTS Plate A:  427 colonies Plate B:  87 colonies Question: What was the number of bacteria in the original  S. putrefaciens broth culture? Note: Make sure your answer reflects proper scientific notation! Use the ^ to denote an exponent, i.e. 1 x 10-4 would be written as 1 x 10^-4. Note: Don't forget the units. No points without units!

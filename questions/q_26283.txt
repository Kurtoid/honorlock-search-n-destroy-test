Sum of Geometric Series In mathematics, a geometric series is a series with a constant ratio between successive terms. The following series is a geometric series because each successive term can be obtained by multiplying the previous term by 1/3.   Write a C program using repetition statement of your choice to compute the sum of THIS geometric series for n terms.   The program should ask the user to enter the number of terms (n). Then, the program calculates and displays the summation. Use double precision and display the values with 10 decimal places.  The examples of input/output dialog are as following: Enter number of term(s): 10The 10-term sum of geometric series with a=1 and r=1/3 is 1.4999745974 or Enter number of term(s): 15The 15-term sum of geometric series with a=1 and r=1/3 is 1.4999998955 or Enter number of term(s): 20The 20-term sum of geometric series with a=1 and r=1/3 is 1.4999999996 Side Notes: 1.) a=1 and r=1/3 mean that the first term begins with 1 and the constant ratio is equal to 1/3, respectively. 2.) When dividing two integers, the result is integer.  Upload your code (main.c file only) below:

Consider a test suite consisting of three deterministic tests T1, T2, T3 for a correct program P. Since P is correct, it passes all the three tests. Suppose we have three mutants M1, M2, M3 of P such that: M1 fails T1 and T2; M2 fails none; and M3 fails T2 and T3.Let M = P denote that M and P are equivalent. Likewise, let M != P denote that they are NOT equivalent. Mutation analysis will bring M2 to the tester's attention since it does not fail any test in the test suite. What actions should you as the tester plausibly consider taking next?  Ignore M2 unconditionally. [q1] Determine if M2 != P, and if so, then ignore M2. [q2] Determine if M2 != P, and if so, then try to devise and add a new test case T4 on which P passes but M2 fails. [q3] Determine if M2 = P, and if so, then ignore M2. [q4]

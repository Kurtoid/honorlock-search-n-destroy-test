Case study #6 Clostridium botulinum is the causative agent of botulism. This Gram-positive, anaerobic bacillus is commonly found on plants, in soil and water, and in the intestinal tract of some animals. The main virulence factor of C. botulinum is botulism toxin, which is a protein neurotoxin that causes muscle paralysis. Death results from paralysis of respiratory muscles. Genetic analysis has led to the understanding that C. botulinum has acquired its toxin genes from lysogenic bacteriophages. Adults who ingest C. botulinum spores alone generally do not become ill. However, adult botulism will result after ingestion of food containing botulinum toxin. Boiling and common chemical treatments used for water denatures botulism toxin. Infantile botulism, rather, results after children under the age of one ingest foods, such as honey, which contains C. botulinum spores but no botulinum toxin. Once inside the infant gut, these spores germinate and botulism toxin is produced after colonization. Treatment for botulism requires injections of botulinum antitoxin, pre-made antibodies that are administered to the patient as quickly as possible.   T/F: Adding a few tablespoons of honey to a small amount of boiling water makes the honey safe for infants to eat.

Which of the following statements is true with regard to analyte changes due to exercise and stress?
Problem No. 2 Shown below is a diving board that is supported by springs at A and B.   A boy with a mass of 60-kg stands at the free end of the board as shown. The spring constant (stiffness) of both springs k=60 kN/m. The board is assumed to be rigid, i.e. it remain straight at all times (does not curve). Before the boy stepping on the board it was perfectly horizontal. Take g=9.807 m/s^2 and neglect the weight of the board.  Based on this information answer the following question: Question 2.6: At what position measured from A will position (height) of the diving board will be unchanged? [HINT: Consider using similar triangles. Enter value in mm]

The logical sequence of precise steps that perform a task is referred to as a(n):
At bar closing time, ordinary customers placed orders at a fast-food restaurant. Researchers entered the restaurant later, and cashiers completed a work satisfaction measure. On another night, confederates who acted belligerently toward the cashiers placed orders. Researchers identified themselves, sat directly across from the counter, and watched the interactions. Cashiers completed the work satisfaction measure again. Cashiers expressed more satisfaction on the night in which they faced belligerent vs. ordinary customers. This outcome probably was due to the:

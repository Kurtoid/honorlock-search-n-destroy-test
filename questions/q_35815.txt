Use the following experimental description to answer the dropdown multiple choice questions.             A researcher performs an experiment involving two strains of bacteria.  The donor strain is met+thr+pro+val+strs.  The recipient strain is met-thr-pro-val-strr.  He mixes the strains and takes samples out at 5 min, 10 min, 15 min and 30 min.  He spreads the cells on media containing streptomycin then tests each colony that grows for the ability to produce the amino acids of interest (met,thr, pro, val).  The results are shown below:       time (min)   %  of cells that are...         met+   pro+   val+   thr+     5 min   0   0   0   0     10 min   0   85   0   0     15 min   0   97   98   0     30 min   25   100   100   0       The experiment being conducted is a [1]. From the data you can tell that the thr gene is [2]. The correct order of the genes from the origin of transfer is [3]

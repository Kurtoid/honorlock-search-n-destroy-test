BRIEF CASE HISTORY FOR ADAM, A STUDENT WITH A LANGUAGE LEARNING DISABILITY Adam is a fifth-grade student who is identified as having a language-based learning disability. His IQ is within normal limits, with his nonverbal performance quotient slightly higher than his verbal performance quotient. According to standardized language testing, his overall language ability falls about 1.5 standard deviations below the mean, with specific difficulties producing complex sentences and explaining the relationships between words that are similar. This testing further suggests that he is able to follow simple two-step directions; however, complex two-step directions that involve temporal or spatial concepts are challenging to him. Adam's language testing results are consistent with his classroom performance. In the classroom, Adam is always one or two steps behind his classmates when the teacher provides classroom instructions. He is able to spell words he knows with similar accuracy to his classroom peers. New words present two challenges for Adam. First, it takes him more time to learn to spell the word compared to his peers, and second, he is rarely able to recall the words to use in context or provide meanings for these words. Because of this, he rarely passes his weekly spelling and vocabulary tests. When it comes to reading, Adam is able to read classroom material with similar accuracy to his peers; however, his reading fluency is somewhat slower than his classmates. Adam has difficulty understanding what he reads; this is demonstrated by not being able to retell narrative or expository text with similar accuracy to his classmates. Furthermore, he does poorly on multiple choice and short answer questions about the text he reads. With regard to writing, Adam is able to produce short narrative stories and expository essays. Although he is able to generate good ideas for his writing, when translating these ideas to paper, his difficulties with spelling, semantics, and syntax become obvious. He generally has difficulty spelling less frequent words and his writing demonstrates less variety in word choice with simple sentences.   Please  provide at least 2 criterion-referenced assessment tasks that would be appropriate for this child in each language component: (Please explain why you think each task is appropriate for this child and provide a general description of the task)  Semantics Syntax Pragmatics (including Conversation and Narrative)    Also  provide 1 goal of intervention for each area. Your goals should include a "do" statement (what the child must accomplish that can be measured), the circumstances under which such goal must be accomplished (condition), and a criterion (accuracy level), by the end of the academic year.

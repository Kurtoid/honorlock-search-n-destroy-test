Design a subsurface flow (SF) constructed wetland with enough capacity to remove BOD loads. The inflow is 300 m3/d, the BOD influent concentration is 150 mg/L and the BOD effluent concentration needs to be 7 mg/L. The average air temperature during the coldest month is 5 degC and the average inflow wastewater temperature during the same month is 7 degC. Broad leaf cattails are available in the area to be used in the constructed wetland. Also, medium gravel size (25-35 mm diameter) is available in the area. Consider a 5 cm litter layer and a 5 cm dry gravel layer on top of the saturated medium gravel layer. The desired increment of depth serving as head differential is 3% for the hydraulic design. How many cells are needed and what are the dimensions of the cells if the aspect ratio selected is 1:1?

You are an extension agent and you have been asked by a sheep producer to evaluate two approaches to improving grease fleece weight. You and the producer agree that grease fleece weight is the trait of primary economic importance in his/her business. The producer would like to either select his/her animals either on grease fleece weight directly or weaning weight as a lamb. This large operation produces its own sires that are used in natural service. Males and females would be selected using the same phenotypic trait: either grease fleece weight or weaning weight. Estimated breeding values are based only on the individual animals' phenotypes (i.e., no pedigree or progeny information is used). The genetic correlation between grease fleece weight and weaning weight is 0.60, with breeding value standard deviations of 0.7 lb and 4 lb for grease fleece weight and weaning weights, respectively. Heritability is .40 for grease fleece weight and .20 for weaning weight. Rams are used as sires for one lamb crop, so male generation interval is 1.5 years; ewes are used as dams for 7 lamb crops, so female generation interval is 5 years. The best 1 out of 20 rams and the best 1 out of 5 ewes are selected as breeding animals.   a. Would genetic improvement for grease fleece weight be greater by directly selecting on grease fleece weight or indirectly by selecting on weaning weight? What would be the annual rate of genetic improvement (lb/yr) for grease fleece weight for each selection method?         b. By direct selection on grease fleece weight? ______________________               By indirect selection on weaning weight? ________________________

Observations are a type of qualitative research.
The following questions refer to the diagram below. The solutions in the two arms of the U-tube are separated at the bottom of the tube by a selectively permeable membrane. At the beginning of the experiment the volumes in both arms are the same, and the level of the liquid is therefore at the same height. The membrane is permeable to water and to sodium and chloride ions, but not to glucose. The apparatus is allowed to stand for three days.      The fluid on Side X will rise because the solution in Side X had lower osmotic potential than the solution in Side Y.

Dr. He A 21-year-old man presents to the ambulatory care clinic with an erythematous, swollen, painful left elbow. History is significant for untreated impetigo on his left forearm. A joint aspirate reveals gram-positive cocci in clusters. The physician begins empiric treatment with vancomycin while the organism is cultured. It is found to be methicillin susceptible. Methicillin is not widely used, but which of the following is an equivalent drug that could be used to treat this man's infection?
For the next 5 questions:  Laboratory experiments designed to measure LC50 values for the effect of certain toxicants on fish are run by two methods. The goal is to fit a model that can predict the LC50 Flow Through (FT) using the values of LC50 Static as the predictor.    FT 23.00 22.30 9.40 9.70 0.15 0.28 0.75 0.51 28.00 0.39   Static 39.00 37.50 22.20 17.50 0.64 0.45 2.62 2.36 32.00 0.77    Assume all the assumptions are met.  Note, that "FT" is the response here. Code: LC50=data.frame(FT=c(23.00,22.30,9.40,9.70,0.15,0.28,0.75,0.51,28.00,0.39), Static=c(39.00,37.50,22.20,17.50,0.64,0.45,2.62,2.36,32.00,0.77)) #complete this line reg=lm(,data=LC50)

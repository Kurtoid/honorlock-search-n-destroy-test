The mean thermal conductivity of an alloy used in manufacturing heat exchangers is required to be greater than 4 W/m.K. Past experience has indicated that the standard deviation of thermal conductivity is 2 W/m.K. A random sample of 50 specimens is tested, and the average thermal conductivity is found to be 4.05 W/m.K. Should the alloy be judged acceptable if confidence level is 0.01? All 7 steps required for hypothesis testing must be shown and submitted with your paperwork.

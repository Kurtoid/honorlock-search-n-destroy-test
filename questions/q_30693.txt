Problem 1 Question 1 to question 2 is for problem 1. Consider an Air-Standard  Otto cycle under the given conditions: compression ratio r = V1/V2 = 10,  V1 = 7x10-4 m3, and mean effective pressure MEP = 720 kPa. (The specific heat ratio k =1.4.)
Spermatogenesis begins with a diploid [option1] which divides through mitosis to produce a diploid [option2], which then undergoes meiosis I to produce two [option3]. Meiosis II then produces four haploid [option4], which further differentiate into sperm cells.

A project requires the completion of eight activities. The immediate predecessors, normal time (weeks), maximum crash time (weeks), and per week crash cost ($) for each activity are shown in the table below.    Activity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   immediate predecessors none none 1 1,2 2 4,5 6 3,7   normal time 8 6 7 9 4 5 5 8   max crash time 3 2 4 4 2 2 2 4   per week cost 550 675 475 500 725 450 625 775    The project must be completed within 20 weeks. Using the above information, develop a linear programming formulation that can be used to determine which activities should be crashed (and by how many weeks) so that the project can be completed on time at minimum cost. Again, do not attempt to solve the problem in any way - just provide the formulation.

Dolan conducted a study of the lived experiences of women undergoing chemotherapy. She conducted in-depth interviews with 11 women who were undergoing treatment in a suburban hospital near Toronto. The women were recruited through referrals from oncologists. Dolan began by selecting women known to have a range of chemotherapy experience. For example, she interviewed women who had been in treatment over an extended period (or at multiple points in their lives), as well as women who had recently begun treatment. She also made efforts to include women with a range of cancer diagnoses and to include both older and younger women. After the first 9 interviews were completed, Dolan's reached data saturation and the analysis yielded 3 major themes. She recruited two additional women to verify that her emerging themes were valid.

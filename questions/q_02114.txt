Consider the figure below. Assuming the IP address of R1 is R.IP= 100.0.0.0, and the subnet mask for the network is subnet.IP = 255.255.224.0 a) Assign (make up your own) appropriate IP addresses for subnet C, subnet F and host H2(B). Appropriate means the addresses should not violate the protocols we have discussed for IP addresses and subnets. Note: Each of the subnets should be able to host a maximum of 280 nodes. Answer format Decimal Integer form CIDR IP address. Example 333.333.333.333/20 Chosen address for node C: [NodeCAddress] Chosen address for node F: [NodeFAddress] Chosen address for node H2: [NodeH2Address]

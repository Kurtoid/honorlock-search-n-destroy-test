A piece of Silicon is doped with 5 x 1015 acceptor atoms/cm3  at 300K.  A laser with photon energies greater than Eg shines on the entire piece generating 4 x 1021 EHPs/cm3  per second. The electron lifetime is 10-7 s and the hole lifetime are both 10-6 s. The electron mobility is 1300 cm2/ V-s and Dp = 12 cm2/s. The laser is turned off at time t = 0. What is the concentration of majority and minority charge carriers (in units of 1015 cm-3) 300ns after the laser is turned off? Enter your answers as majority concentration; minority concentration, each with 3 significant figures.

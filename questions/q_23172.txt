Please use the following fact pattern to answer questions 1-10: Kramer established a trust with the following property: 50,000 shares of Yada Yada Yada (YYY) Company common stock, $200,000 from his account at City Bank, and a condominium in Del Boca Vista, Florida with a fair market value of $200,000.  Kramer named Jerry as trustee and directed that income from the trust be paid to Jerry for 10 years and, after 10 years, the corpus to be distributed to George and Elaine, in equal shares.  The trust agreement also provided, "No trustee named herein shall be liable for any act of self-dealing or bad faith in the administration of this trust." Shortly after becoming trustee, Jerry took the following actions:  (i) he sold 30,000 shares of YYY Company, which for 30 years had paid a very modest dividend, and used the proceeds to buy common stock in Urban Sombrero Corporation, a newly-established business selling a sombrero designed for the urban business professional, combining "the spirit of Old Mexico with a little big-city panache" - Urban Sombrero was expected to take New York by storm and the company to pay very high dividends according to statements made by its president and Jerry undertook no additional research before making his investment; (ii) he obtained a personal loan from Newman and pledged as collateral for the loan 10,000 shares of the Kramer Trust's YYY Company stock; (iii) he entered into a lease agreement for the condominium with George's parents, Frank and Estelle Costanza, for a term of 15 years, which provided for an annual fair market rent of $24,000; and (iv) at a substantial savings on the condominium insurance (and a corresponding increase in the trust income Jerry paid himself), he increased the deductible from $5,000 to $100,000 per occurrence. A year later, Urban Sombrero Corporation collapsed due to lack of demand for its product, and its shares were rendered worthless.  In addition, an uncontrollable fire caused by Frank's attempt to roast chestnuts in the condominium's fireplace during his Festivus celebration destroyed a large portion of the condominium, resulting in a loss of $115,000.  The insurance company paid the Kramer Trust $15,000, the difference between the amount of the loss and the deductible.  Jerry claimed that the $15,000 was income, and he paid it out to himself.  No longer having the income stream from the dividends paid by Urban Sombrero Corporation and the rental income on the condominium, Jerry defaulted on his loan from Newman, and Newman foreclosed on the YYY Company stock. George and Elaine sue Jerry claiming he breached his fiducary duty of care with respect to the sale of the YYY stock and the investment in the Urban Sombrero Corporation.  What is the likely result?

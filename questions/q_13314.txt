For this quiz, you will design and utilize a hardware expansion for the ATxmega128A1U, not strictly for the OOTB uPAD. (In other words, any constraints imposed by the OOTB uPAD and not the microcontroller will not apply here.) The expansion must consist of [1] a 16k x 8 SRAM, [2] an 8-bit output port, [3] a single active-low LED circuit, and [4] any other components that are appropriate for items [1]-[3]. The SRAM and output port must be memory-mapped to the data memory space of the ATxmega128A1U, by way of the EBI system. The least-significant bit of the output port must drive the active-low LED circuit. Overall, a minimal amount of external digital logic (gates) must be used to implement the relevant design. Below, an additional set of constraints is given to specify exactly how the relevant components must be memory-mapped. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Memory-mapping constraints:   (Overall) The SRAM 3-PORT ALE1 mode of the EBI system must be utilized. Whenever appropriate, address decoding must be performed by way of chip select signals; external circuitry may only be utilized for address decoding when a single chip select is not sufficient. All external circuitry used for memory-mapping must be implemented with [1] discrete SSI logic components (i.e., AND gates, OR gates, NOT gates, NAND gates, etc.), not with a PLD, and [2] a minimal amount of digital logic.   (SRAM) By way of full address decoding, the SRAM component must be fully addressable and have its first address correspond to the data memory address 0x37 E000. Only chip selects CS0 and CS1 may be utilized. If only one chip select is needed, CS0 must be used; if two chip selects are needed, both CS0 and CS1 must be used.  (Output Port) The output port must only be accessible via data memory addresses within the range 0x47 8000 - 0x47 BFFF. Only chip selects CS2 and CS3 may be utilized. If only one chip select is needed, CS2 must be used; if two chip selects are needed, both CS2 and CS3 must be used.

In the early stages of the digestive process, acetylcholine released by the vagus nerve, stimulates the (1)________________ cell to release gastrin, which then stimulates the enterochromaffin-like cell to produce (2)__________________ which stimulates the (3)__________________ cell to produce HCl. The secretion of H+ to the gastric lumen involves the movement of intracellular vesicles containing the enzyme (4)___________________ to the surface to fuse with the apical plasma membrane. The lower pH causes (5)_______________________ from the Chief cell to convert to its active form (6)___________________. The lower gastric pH also stimulates the D cells to produce (7)______________________, which inhibits gastrin release and enacts a regulatory control of the process. When the acidic chyme enters the small intestine, the lower pH (~pH 4) stimulates mucosal cells to produce (8)________________  which inhibits gastrin release and also stimulates the pancreas to release  (9)___________ and (10)___________ into the pancreatic duct, thus facilitating the movement of zymogens. Pancreatic acinar cells are signaled to release zymogen granules by the duodenal peptide hormone (11)___________________________, which also stimulates the (12)_________________ to release bile.  Because of the secretions from the pancreatic duct, the pH in the duodenum is (13) (decreased or increased?) ______________, thereby facilitating the processing of zymogens such as proelastase or procarboxypeptidase by the enzyme (14)_______________________ to their active forms in the duodenum.

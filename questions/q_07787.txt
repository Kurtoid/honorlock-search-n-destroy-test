Write a class called BulkOrder that extends the ItemOrder class from problem 6. A BulkOrder is similar to an ItemOrder but it represents an item that has a bulk price. That is, an item that you will be charged less for if you buy a certain quantity of. For example, pencils might cost 30 cents each or 5 for 1 dollar. A BulkOrder should have the same member functions as an ItemOrder but they should differ in the following ways:  A BulkOrder should have a constructor that takes a bulk quantity (as an integer) and a bulk price (total cents as an integer) as well as the parameters ItemOrder's constructor takes. For example:BulkOrder* bulk1 = new BulkOrder("A22-B", 13, 30, 5, 100);13 represents the quantity ordered, 30 represents the price in cents per item, 5 represents the quantity needed to get the bulk price and 100 represents the bulk price in cents A getBulkQuantity() member function should be added which should return the bulk quantity. A getBulkPrice() member function should be added which should return the bulk price. getPrice() should be altered to compute the price for a bulk item by charging the bulk rate for each time the bulk quantity can fit into the ordered amount and the base price for any remaining. For example, bulk1->getPrice() should return 290 because 5 fits into 13 twice so we add the bulk price (100) twice and there are 3 left over so we add the individual price 3 times. The print operator

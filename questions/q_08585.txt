Maria goes to Danny's Sub Shop and buys a meatball sub. Maria eats what looks to be a meatball covered in sauce but turns out to be a roach. Maria screams and spits out her sub. Danny, fearing her public outcry, tells Maria, "I'll give you whatever you want if you just stop screaming. You can have a hundred dollars now, plus free subs and chips for the next 10 months - you just need to stop screaming." Maria stops screaming, and Danny says, "thank you; we've got a deal." Danny hands Maria five $20 bills and begins writing out the terms of their deal on a napkin. The terms on the napkin are: "Maria agrees to not sue Danny about, or to discuss with others, today's incident with the alleged roach. In return, Maria gets free subs for ten months from today's date of March 25, 2021." Maria and Danny both sign the napkin. A month later, Maria returns to Danny's Sub Shop and orders a turkey sub and potato chips. Danny gives her the sub for free but charges her for the chips. Maria complains that the contract included free chips. Danny says he was just trying to calm her down and that they "officially agreed" to only free subs. Should Danny provide Maria with free chips?

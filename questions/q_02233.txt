Consider two receptors, one inhibitory and one activating, on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells: KIR receptors that interact with certain class I MHC proteins, and special Fc receptors that recognize IgG antibodies. When NK cells are incubated with an immortalized (i.e. cancerous) B cell line derived by infection of human B cells with Epstein-Barr Virus, the B cells are killed by NK cells. Normal B cells, by contrast, are not efficiently killed by NK cells. In each of the following scenarios, indicate whether the described changes are expected to enhance, suppress or have no effect on the cytotoxicity (killing activity) of the NK cells in this system. Match the prompt with one of these choices.

Iron is biologically important in the transport of oxygen by red blood cells from the lungs to the various organs of the body. In the blood of an adult human, there are approximately 2.63 x 1013 red blood cells with a total of 2.90 g of iron. On the average, how many iron atoms are present in each red blood cell?

The Following Problem will be referenced in the Flowchart Problem and the Coding Problem PROBLEM: Speed at a given time t is equal to  (v0 * t) + 1/2(a*(t^2)), where v0 is the initial velocity and a is the acceleration.  Assume that the acceleration is 9.8.  v0 is a floating-point number and t is a whole number; define a as a constant floating-point number.  Write a program that asks the user for the initial velocity of an object and the elapsed time time t and calculates the speed.          Define your variables  Ask the user to enter the initial velocity v0 and time.   If time is 0 or less, output the message "Invalid Time" and end the program.  If v0 is less than 0, output the message "Invalid Initial Velocity" and end the program.  Otherwise, do the following:   Compute the speed using the formula: s = (v0*t) + 1/2(a*(t^2)) (obviously you need to convert this to C++ code and that may take several separate statements)    Display the result to the screen using 2 columns: a label  in the first column and in the second printing the number using exactly 4 decimal places. (use setw to define the columns)     Write a c++ program to solve this problem and submit your .cpp file below

The Cartesian Product is one of the five basic Relational Algebra operators. The Division (Quotient) operator is a derived Relational Algebra operator. Is the statement "The Division operator is the opposite of the Cartesian Product operator" correct or incorrect? In other words, if R and S are two relations and T = R x S holds, are then T / S = R and T / R = S? Please argue in either direction.

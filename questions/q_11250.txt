HOEKOM SO SELF(IE) MAL? deur Lydia van der Merwe        Dink jy aan 'n selfie, dink jy beslis aan Kim Kardashian, die koningin van selfies. Maar sy is nie die enigste een nie. Ook jy het seker al 'n selfie geneem. Sommige kenners se dis net pret, ander dink dis 'n vorm van narsisme (narcissism). Want enigiets - wat jy eet, waar jy vakansie hou of net chill - word mos deesdae met 'n lang arm met jou slimfoon-kamera afgeneem: met jouself natuurlik prominent as deel van die foto. En dan word dit op Facebook, Instagram of 'n ander sosiale netwerk gelaai om aan die wereld te wys: Kyk, ek eet! Kyk, ek chill! Kyk, ek neem 'n selfie! Dis beslis die tyd van die #selfie, 'n speelding van ryk en arm. Die feit kom selfs in popliedjies voor. Dink aan die liedjie "Selfies" van die Skotse sangeres Nina Nesbitt. Daar is selfs 'n internationale Selfie-dag op 21 Junie. G'n wonder die nuustydskrif Time het dit einde 2012 as een van die tien top-gonswoorde van die jaar  aangewys nie. Volgens die selfoon- en kameravervaardiger Samsung is tot 30% van die foto's wat jongmense (tussen 18 en 34) neem, selfies. 91% van tieners doen dit gereeld, volgens 'n opname van die Amerikaanse Pew Research Centre. Onskuldige pret, net nog 'n manier om jouself uit te druk? Nee, se 'n tweede groep. Die ontploffing van die selfie wys maar net weer ons lewe in 'n buitengewoon narsistiese era. "Narsisme is 'n sieklike vorm van self-liefde: ek ... ek ... ek ... Ek is byvoorbeeld op Instagram en Facebook en Google+ en Twitter en Snapchat en Viber en en en ... As jy kyk hoeveel foto's veral jonger mense van hulself op sosiale netwerke plaas, se dit nogal baie." Teen einde Oktober 2016 is reeds 34,700,000,000 foto's op die sosiale netwerk geplaas. Volgens Dion Chang het sosiale media die manier verander hoe ons na die wereld kyk. Dit leer ons om na alles met 'n nuwe oog te kyk sodat ons dit op die internet kan plaas. Dit word die Facebook-oog-effek genome. Jou hele lewe kry 'n "mooi" raampie en jy wys net die perfekte kant. 'n Studie wys dat Facebook jou daarom depressief kan maak. Selfies is net deel daarvan. Jy plaas die fokus 100% op jou, se Dion. Die einde is nog lank nie daar nie. Dit gaan net aanhou groei. Volgens Dion is ons in 'n hiper-visuele lewe en ons sien dit op sosiale netwerke. Hy voorspel 'n reuse groei in Instagram en Snapchat. Selfies is die gewildste onder millennials (mense van 18-34 jaar), die generasie wat met die nuwe digitale tegnologie grootgeword het, volgens 'n opname wat die Pew Research Centre in Amerika gedoen het. Sowat 55% van hulle het al 'n selfie op 'n sosiale media-webwerf geplaas. In vergelyking met net 24% van generasie X (sowat 35-49 jaar), 9% van die baby boomers (sowat 50-68 jaar) en 4% van die silent generation (sowat 69-87 jaar). Maar dit is nog lank nie die dood van selfies nie.                                              [Verwerk en verander uit http://www.sarie.com/lewe-liefdes/hieroor-praat-mense/hoekom-selfie-behep

Which of the following veins returns blood from the brain to the heart?
Congratulations! You were recently hired as the Title IX coordinator at your alma mater, ODU.  Little did you know, you were hired just in time to learn the following story: Defense Debbie was a dominant high school and club soccer player.  So much so, that she was being recruited by nearly all the top Division I collegiate soccer programs.  After a lengthy recruiting process, Defense Debbie decided to attend and play soccer for the ODU Fighting Dolphins, a national women's powerhouse.  Coach Handsy Henley has been the coach of ODU for the past 18 seasons.  Throughout those 18 seasons, Coach Henley has amassed 12 conference titles, six final four appearances and four national championships.  ODU has not only had a number of women go on to compete professionally, but six women currently play for the US Women's National Team, a team in which Coach Henley is one of the assistant coaches.  Defense Debbie arrived on campus for her freshmen season and became an immediate contributor.  While not a starter, Defense Debbie played a good number of minutes and contributed to her team's success that saw the ODU Dolphins rise to the #5 national ranking.  The ODU Dolphins went on to win a conference title before bowing out in the second round of the NCAA tournament.  Defense Debbie earned second team all-conference and conference freshman of the year. Following the season, Coach Henley met with each player individually to discuss areas for improvement.   Defense Debbie's meeting with Coach Henley did not go as she expected.  In the meeting, Coach Henley sat uncomfortably close to Defense Debbie and even rubbed her thigh.  Coach Henley informed Defense Debbie with a wink that there were other ways to ensure she had a starting position on next year's team. Defense Debbie brushed off Coach Henley's behavior as just an odd occurrence.  She mentioned the interaction to a senior teammate who responded by saying, "Yeah, Coach, got in trouble with the athletic department for being a little too touchy feely with the team a few years ago, but he has gotten his act back together.  It was no big deal.  Plus, we all know he is a winning coach so we put up with his antics"  Nothing unusual happened the remainder of the post-season between Defense Debbie and Coach Henley. Defense Debbie returned to campus for pre-season training for the start of her sophomore season.  Because of her success during her freshman season, Defense Debbie expected to be contending for a starting position.  Pre-season did not go as Defense Debbie anticipated.  She was not named the starter for the first game of the season.  The first game happened to be on the road at their rival.  The night before the first game, Coach Henley called Defense Debbie and asked her to come to his hotel room to discuss her playing time.  While Defense Debbie had never received such a call before, she did not think it out of the ordinary.  However, when she arrived at Coach Henley's room, he reminded her of their end of season meeting from the season before.  He then went on to try to kiss Defense Debbie.  Defense Debbie shirked the pass at her and exited the room.  The next day at their first game, Defense Debbie didn't get any playing time By the mid-point of the season, Defense Debbie was in a sexual relationship with Coach Henley.  Following the start of this relationship, Defense Debbie immediately became a starter, a role that she would hold for the remainder of the season.  Throughout Defense Debbie's junior season, the sexual relationship with Coach Henley continued.  Defense Debbie had attempted on multiple occasions to end the relationship.  Each attempt to end the relationship was followed up with Coach Henley making threats about her playing time, accusing Defense Debbie of initiating the relationship in the first place, telling Defense Debbie her teammates would hate her, and threatening to dismiss her from the team.  Defense Debbie was distraught over her relationship with Coach Henley.  Throughout her junior year, Defense Debbie began to struggle in her coursework.  She slipped into a rather deep depression and found it difficult to get out of bed at times.  The team's athletic trainer approached Defense Debbie after practice one day and asked her if she was feeling ok.  Defense Debbie responded by saying she was just dealing with some personal things; the conversation was left at that.  Defense Debbie's play on the field really began to suffer.  While an all-conference player during her sophomore season, Defense Debbie was now struggling to even keep up at practice.  Over the course of the past two seasons, Defense Debbie had developed a close relationship with one of the assistant coaches, Assistant Coach Allison.  Really needing a friend to talk to, Defense Debbie spilled her guts to Assistant Coach Allison on a road trip.  Defense Debbie begged Assistant Coach Allison to keep the relationship news quiet.   Assistant Coach Allison informed Defense Debbie a similar situation had occurred with an athlete a year before Defense Debbie arrived on campus.  Assistant Coach Allison told Defense Debbie she reported the situation to the assistant athletic director and nearly lost her job over "being a snitch."  So, Assistant Coach Allison promised Defense Debbie her secret was safe.  At the conclusion of her junior season, Defense Debbie could no longer take the stress and decided to quit the team.  A year later, Defense Debbie filed a lawsuit against ODU for violating her Title IX rights by not protecting her against Coach Handsy Henlsey.   ODU responded to Defense Debbie's lawsuit by filing summary judgement because  not only was the  relationship between two consenting adults but that they were never made aware of the relationship.

Use the information below to answer questions 15-20. Two species of plants, the red monkey flower and the purple monkey flower, live at different elevations along a mountainside. Researchers transplanted individuals of each species to elevations where they do not normally occur; red monkey flowers (M. cardinalis) were moved up the mountain, and purple monkey flowers (M. lewisii) were moved down the mountain. At the same time, some plants of each species were dug up and replanted at their normal elevation. After one year, the researchers returned and counted the number of seeds produced by each plant as an estimate of fitness. The bar graph below shows mean number of seeds per plant at each elevation, ranging from 415 m to 3000 m. The diagram beneath this bar graph shows the elevational ranges where each species lives alone (red band for M. cardinalis and blue band for M. lewisii) and where both species live together (light-blue band).    The mountain above illustrates the geographic range of two species of flowers, M. cardinalis (red zone) and M. lewisii (blue zone). At four sites, researchers planted both species and recorded their fitness; these data are shown in the bar graph above the illustration of their geographic ranges.   True or false? In this experiment, the control group comprised the plants that were dug up and replanted at their normal elevation.
5. The headline in the Sacramento Bee newspaper read, "Women appear to be better investors than men in study" (Jack Sirard, April 24, 2005, p. D1).  The conclusion was based on a telephone poll of 500 randomly selected men and 500 randomly selected women.  One quote in the article was that "men are much more likely to stick with a losing investment than women are (45% vs 37%).  Of the 500 male investors, 225 decided to stick with a losing investment.  Of the 500 female investors, 185 decided to stick with a losing investment.  The following table displays the data for these two groups.    Group n  Number who stick with a losing investment    Male Investors 500 225   Female Investors 500 185    Test the research hypothesis that the population proportion of male investors who decided to stick with a losing investment is more than that of female investors who decided to stick with a losing investment.  Construct and interpret a 90% confidence interval for the difference in the population proportion of male and female investors who stick with a losing investment. (e) What is the upper bound of the 90% confidence interval?

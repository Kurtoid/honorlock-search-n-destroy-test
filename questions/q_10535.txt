Module 09 - Self-talk & Mental Imagery: Question: Nate's mental imagery program primarily includes ______ and ______ functions of PETTLEP based imagery. Nate's Back Story: Nate played college football before transitioning to Rugby when he realized he would not make it in the NFL. He has transitioned to the sport well and now finds himself competing for a spot on the U.S. Rugby 7s Olympic Team. Because he is still transitioning to the sport of Rugby, he sometimes feels lost during competition and reverts to football specific skills he'd practiced since he was in Pop Warner. He decides to meet with a Sport Psychology Consultant who prescribes some PETTLEP based mental imagery training. In Nate's mental imagery script, he is instructed to wear his uniform while imagining passing, executing a line out, a garryowen (up and under) kick-pass, and kicking a penalty goal.

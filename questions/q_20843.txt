When 1.50 g of Ba(s) is added to 100.00 g of water in a container open to the atmosphere, the reaction shown below occurs and the temperature of the resulting solution rises from 22.00degC to 33.10degC. If the specific heat of the solution is 4.18 J/(g [?] degC), calculate DH for the reaction, as written. Ba(s) + 2 H2O(l) - Ba(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)   DH= ? 1.

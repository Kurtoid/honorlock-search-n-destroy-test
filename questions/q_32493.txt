You are a scientist in a biotech company that produces custom engineered tissues for patients. Your current project is to develop a bone replacement for a 30-year-old patient who lost part of his pelvis through cancer. At the team meeting, you propose using adipose-derived stem cells isolated from the patient for this project in combination with a scaffold made from the synthetic polymer poly-l-lactic acid.   1. To ensure that the fabricated scaffold does not degrade quickly, your team performs standard accelerated hydrolysis studies. What 2 methods will you recommend they use to monitor degradation? (4 points) 2. After the study, your team discovers that the polymer degrades very slowly, and not appropriate for bone engineering. Give 2 recommended changes to the polymer (poly-l-lactic acid) to increase the rate of degradation. (6 points)

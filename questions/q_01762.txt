You are transporting a 28-year-old male with a history of epileptic seizures to a tertiary care hospital with specialty neurosurgical capabilities. Earlier today, the patient sustained a prolonged seizure episode, during which he struck his head and sustained a subdural hemorrhage, which was confirmed on CT scan at the sending hospital. There was no evidence of intracranial shifting or mass effect. The patient's serial neurologic exams have been unchanged since departing the hospital. The patient has a GCS of 10 and the last vital signs were blood pressure, 132/78 mm Hg; heart rate, 82 beats/min; respirations, 18 breaths/min; SpO2, 99%. His pupils are PEARRL and 4 mm/brisk bilaterally. The sending hospital has mixed a Dilantin (phenytoin) IV drip at 50 mg/min, and it has just started infusing within the last 10 minutes.

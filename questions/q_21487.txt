(40 minutes) Oil enters a heat exchanger at 150degC while cooling water enters at 30degC. In parallel-flow operation the exit temperatures of oil and water are 80degC and 65degC respectively. Hint: Several significant parameters needed for the equations below can be deduced from these four temperatures. Use these for parts 1 and 2. If the flow rates and inlet conditions are unchanged, find:1) Exit temperature of each stream in counterflow operation2) Lowest temperature to which the oil may be cooled in parallel-flow by increasing the length of the exchanger. Note: You do not need any fluid properties for this problem; you also do not need the mass flow rate Useful relations:

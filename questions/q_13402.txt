Case Study #3--Josh Campbell Josh is a 27 year-old male who recently moved back in with his parents after his fiance was killed by a drunk driver 3 months ago. His fiancee, a beautiful young woman he'd been dating for the past 4 years, was walking across a busy intersection to meet him for lunch one day. He still vividly remembers the horrific scene as the drunk driver ran the red light, plowing down his fiancee right before his eyes. He raced to her side, embracing her crumpled, bloody body as she died in his arms in the middle of the crosswalk. No matter how hard he tries to forget, sometimes he feels as though he is reliving the entire incident. Since the accident, Josh has been plagued with nightmares about the accident almost every night. He quit his job because his office was located in the building right next to the little cafe where he was meeting his fiancee for lunch the day she died. The few times he attempted to return to work were unbearable for him. He has since avoided that entire area of town. Normally an outgoing, fun-loving guy, Josh has become increasingly withdrawn, "jumpy", irritable and angry since his fiance's death. He's stopped working out, playing his guitar, or playing basketball with his friends - all activities he once really enjoyed. His parents worry about how detached and emotionally flat he's become. What is extreme trauma did Josh suffer?

In the following section, you will answer two short essay questions. Each question should be answered in 5-8 sentences. I will only grade up to the first 8 sentences of your writing, so do not try to throw a bunch of stuff at the wall and see if it sticks. Each answer must display a clear understanding of the topics at hand, must connect to course materials, and should be explicitly sociological (i.e., use appropriate terms and theories). I strongly suggest you make a quick bullet point outline for each response before diving in. Answers shorter than five sentences will receive an automatic 5 point penalty.

An investigator is looking at the relation between periodontal disease and the onset of hypertension. Suppose the investigator decides to look at height as a variable that may confound the relationship between exposure and case status in his study.  After collecting information about the height of each participant, he assembles a database that approximates height with the normal distribution.  Assuming the mean of the distribution is 176.2 cm with a standard deviation of 17.5 cm, what are the highest [response1] and lowest [response2] 1% of heights in the population?  Assume the investigator is now looking at the population of Dutch men in his study, and that the mean height there is 184.8 cm with a standard deviation of 16.1 cm, what are the highest [response3] and lowest [response4] 1% of heights in the population? Note that since we are working with a continuous variable here, the precision of your response is important.

For each of the following scenarios on the left, choose from the matching answer on the right, where the first part of the answer indicates at which lapse rate ("dry" for the dry adiabatic lapse rate and "moist" for the moist or wet adiabatic lapse rate) air parcels in that scenario will change temperature. The second part indicates whether that air parcel is cooling or warming. For example, if you think the air parcel in a specific scenario would be cooling at the moist adiabatic lapse rate, you would choose "moist / cool". If you think it would be warming at the dry adiabatic lapse rate, you could choose "dry / warm".

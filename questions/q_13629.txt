Hayes, T.B., Khoury, V., Narayan, A., Nazir, M., Park, A., Brown, T., dame, L., Chan, E., Buchholz, D., Stueve, T., & Gallipeau, S.  (2010).  Atrazine induces complete feminization and chemical castration in male African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), Proceedings from the National Academy of Science, online early version, 1-6.      doi/10.1073/pnas.0909519107 The herbicide atrazine is one of the most commonly applied pesticides in the world. As a result, atrazine is the most commonly detected pesticide contaminant of ground, surface, and drinking water. Atrazine is also a potent endocrine disruptor that is active at low, ecologically relevant concentrations. Previous studies showed that atrazine adversely affects amphibian larval development. The present study demonstrates the reproductive consequences of atrazine exposure in adult amphibians. Atrazine-exposed males were both demasculinized (chemically castrated) and completely feminized as adults. Ten percent of the exposed genetic males developed into functional females that copulated with unexposed males and produced viable eggs. Atrazine- exposed males suffered from depressed testosterone, decreased breeding gland size, demasculinized/feminized laryngeal development, suppressed mating behavior, reduced spermatogenesis, and decreased fertility. These data are consistent with effects of atrazine observed in other vertebrate classes. The present findings exemplify the role that atrazine and other endocrine-disrupting pesticides likely play in global amphibian declines. In this study, what was the independent variable (IV)?
Barbara Baker, a wealthy widow, promises the pastor of her church that she will donate $10,000 to the church to help pay off its mortgage, if the stewardship committee can obtain enough pledges for the balance of the $30,000 mortgage. Other pledges are obtained to pay off the mortgage, but now Barbara has changed her mind and plans to take an around-the-world cruise instead.

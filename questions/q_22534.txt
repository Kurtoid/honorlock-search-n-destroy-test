Question 2(a): Consider the following graph representing a network of cities, where the label on each edge is the cost (in hundreds of ddollars) to travel between the cities:  Use the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, starting at vertex A, to solve the traveling salesman problem on this graph. If the algorithm produces a Hamiltonian circuit, what circuit does it produce? If not, what happens instead?

Five 1-inch cubes of carrot were placed in separate beakers, each containing a different initial concentration of sucrose solution.  The membranes of carrot cells are impermeable to sucrose. At 10-minute intervals, the carrot cubes were removed, blotted to get rid of excess moisture, and their mass was measured. The percent change in mass of each carrot cube was graphed as shown below.   At the end of the experiment, your colleague presents you with a list of concentrations that were used in the experiment.  He confesses that he didn't label the beakers, so he doesn't know which beaker held which concentration of sucrose.  The concentrations used were: 0.2M sucrose, 0.4M sucrose, 0.6M sucrose, 0.8 M sucrose, 1.0M sucrose   Answer the questions below using the provided data   A.  Which beaker contained the most hypotonic solution? [mosthypotonic] B.  Which beaker contained the most hypertonic solution? [mosthypertonic] C.  Which beaker contained solution that was isotonic to the cells? [isotonic] D.  What molarity of sucrose did Beaker D contain? [beakerD] E.  What molarity of sucrose did Beaker E contain? [beakerE]
An estimator performed a sensitivity analysis for two elements of risk in a project under bidding. The results of this sensitivity analysis are shown in the table below.    Risk Element  MinimumCost Estimate   MaximumCost Estimate    Element 1              $970,000            $1,070,000   Element 2              $950,000            $1,100,000    Which of these elements is riskier (i.e. the accuracy of the estimate is more sensitive to this element)? Why?

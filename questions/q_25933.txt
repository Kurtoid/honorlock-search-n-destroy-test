The following operation graphics were developed for a carbon adsorption system.  It is desired to remove the level of benzene from 800 mg/L to 10 mg/L.  The experiments show that a carbon depth of 3 feet (d in the below schematic) can achieve this performance.  Due to equilibrium conditions, the minimum concentration that can be achieved is 2 mg/L.   Referring to the figure below, effluent concentration (in mg/L) at state 3 is most likely:

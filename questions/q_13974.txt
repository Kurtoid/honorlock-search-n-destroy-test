When the delivery arrived several days early, on July 15, the electronics store noticed that the computers did not have all of the features as the top-of-the-line model that was ordered. The electronics store notified the manufacturer that it was rejecting the computers that were delivered and expected the manufacturer to send 25 top-of-the-line models immediately. The manufacturer replied that because of a backlog of orders that had not yet been filled, the top-of-the- line models could not be delivered until October 15. Because the electronics store had contracted with a local college to deliver 10 top-of-the-line models for use by the college's varsity esports program by July 31, the electronics store delivered 10 of the nonconforming gaming computers to the college along with a promise to replace them with 10 top-of-the-line models in mid-October. The electronics store returned the 15 remaining gaming computers to the manufacturer. How much could the electronics store recover from the manufacturer for the 10 gaming computers that it delivered to the college?

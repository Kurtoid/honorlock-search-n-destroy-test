Reading Comprehension: Read the reading below and answer the questions that follow. A New Life 1          Elena Fuller and her family used to be city dwellers. They lived in a large apartment in the middle of the city and enjoyed everything the city had to offer. They seemed to have a good life. Elena's husband, Keith, had a well-paid job with a technology company, and Elena worked as an administrator for a large hospital. Their jobs were stressful, but together, they had a very good income. Their two children, Lucy (aged fourteen) and Rafe (aged ten), attended an excellent school and were active in sports and other extracurricular activities. 2           But four years ago, Elena and Keith started questioning their lifestyle. Elena's parents passed away suddenly. Then, Keith lost his job and couldn't find another one. Those events made them stop and ponder. The family had accumulated a lot of material things, but were they happy? Keith always had a dream of living in the country, so after a lot of discussion, they decided to move out of the city. They bought some land, and Keith started growing and selling organic vegetables. Elena got a job in a small town nearby. Now the family lives a completely different life. 3          We asked Elena to tell us about their decision to move and how it has changed their lives. 4 Q: What did your family and friends think when you said you were moving to the country?  5 EK: Oh, they were really surprised. Some of our friends thought we were totally crazy. They couldn't imagine why we wanted to leave the city. They thought that we were rejecting society and withdrawing from the world. It's interesting now, though, because some of those friends are the ones who enjoy coming to visit us in the country the most. 6 Q: Was it hard to make the move?  7 EK: Well, it wasn't easy at first. We had some difficult moments as a family. I found my job at the assisted living facility quickly, and I discovered that I really enjoyed working with senior citizens. So, it was easier for me. It was harder for the children though, especially for Lucy because she was older. They felt that being city kids set them apart from the other children at first, but then they made friends and it got easier. The move was probably most challenging for Keith, even though it was his idea. He had to learn a lot very quickly about raising vegetables. He made a lot of mistakes at first, so it took time for him to start making money from it. We were both uneasy because we were making so much less money. But it's also much less expensive to live out here, so that helped. 8 Q: How would you describe your quality of life now? Is it better or worse than before?  9 EK: Overall, it's definitely better. We work hard, but life is much slower-paced, so we have more leisure time. It's a very close community. Everyone knows everyone else in town, and that can be hard sometimes because there's a lot of gossip. On the other hand, we don't have to worry about the kids as much because everyone knows them. They're more carefree as a result. 10 Q: Do you ever miss the city? 11 EK: Oh, yes, of course. We miss the wide variety of shops and restaurants, and we miss the cultural opportunities like museums. Sometimes, especially in the winter, we feel the isolation here. We usually visit friends and family in the city a few times a year. It's great to see people and catch up on everything that's going on. But, it's funny, after we're there for a few days, we all start to get a little tired of the crowds, the traffic, and the noise. It starts to feel kind of claustrophobic, and we all feel relieved to get back to the country. 12 Q: So, is this a permanent move? Do you plan to return to the city? 13 EK: Oh, we're not going anywhere. We couldn't afford to move again anyway. But, seriously, Keith and I are happy that we know we'll spend our retirement in the country.

(1)It is sometimes said curiosity killed the cat, but nothing could be further from the truth.  (2)Drives for curiosity seem to aid survival for most animals.  (3)Such drives might be explained by the life-and-death necessity of keeping track of sources of food, danger, and other important details of the environment.  (4)However, the curiosity drives seems to go beyond such needs.  (5)In an experiment, monkeys confined to a dimly lit box learned to perform a simple task in order to open a window that allowed them to view the outside world.  (6)In a similar experiment, monkeys quickly learned to solve a mechanical puzzle made up of interlocking metal pins, hooks, and hinged metal fastenings.  (7)In both situations, no external reward was offered.  (8)The monkeys seemed to work for the sheer fun of it.  (9)An interest in video games, chess, puzzles, and the like offers a human parallel.  (10)Curiosity--and the drive to know--also seem to be powerful in humans.  (11)Scientific investigation, intellectual curiosity, and other advanced activities may be an extension of this basic drive.

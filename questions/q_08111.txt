Example: Determine if  x=16{"version":"1.1","math":"x=16"}  is a solution to the logarithmic equation.              log2x-31=5-log2x{"version":"1.1","math":"log2x-31=5-log2x"}               Check:                      log216-31=5-log216log2-15=5-log216{"version":"1.1","math":"log216-31=5-log216log2-15=5-log216"}               log2-15 {"version":"1.1","math":"log2-15 "} is undefined        Answer: x=16{"version":"1.1","math":"x=16"} is not a solution to the given equation. Exercise: Determine if  x=64{"version":"1.1","math":"x=64"} is a solution to the logarithmic equation.             log4x=3-log4x-63{"version":"1.1","math":"log4x=3-log4x-63"}Use the Graphical equation editor to show your work.

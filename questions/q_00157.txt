The aerodynamic characteristics of a circular cylinder are studied experimentally in the wind tunnel in Lab A109. The working fluid is air with density,  r = 1 . 20 +- 0 . 01  kg/m3. The freestream velocity, U =  [U] m/s with an uncertainty of [uu] m/s. The surface pressure on the cylinder surface is measured to be  D p = p -  p [?]  = [dp]  Pa with an uncertainty of [up] Pa. If the coefficient of pressure is defined as:   C p  =   D p   ( 1 / 2 ) r    U 2     find the uncertainty in the coefficient of pressure.

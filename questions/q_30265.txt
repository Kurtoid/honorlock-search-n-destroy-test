What is the density of iron if it crystallizes in a body-centered cubic unit cell with an edge length of 287 pm? HINTS:The density of a substance is the mass/volume ratio of iron. Knowing it is a body-centered cubic unit cell means it has 2 atoms per cell. Use the molar mass of iron to find the mass of two atoms of iron. Use the given edge length to find the volume in units of cm3. Use the edge length to find the volume of the unit cell in units of g/cm3. Then, combine the mass of the two atoms with the volume of the unit cell to find the density.

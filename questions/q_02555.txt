Colorblindness and adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) are both X linked recessive phenotypes (C = normal; c = colorblind and A = normal; a = adrenoleukodystrophy). The genes are 12 m.u. apart on the X chromosome.  Adult onset cerebral ALD begins in middle age and has a rapid onset to death. Cara's dad is color blind and has just started showing signs of ALD. Assume there are no recessive alleles on Cara's mother's side of the family (i.e., assume Cara is C___A c___a). Cara's 3-yr old son Oliver has normal vision. What is the probability that Oliver will develop ALD?

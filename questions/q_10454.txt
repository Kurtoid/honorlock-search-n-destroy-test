There is some concern that ecotourism activities that involve shark feeding can affect the foraging behavior and health of sharks that are exposed to these behaviors. This may occur because the food that divers provide to sharks may make up a larger portion of their overall diet and "replace" their natural prey. If this is true, it is also possible that the diver-supplied food may be of a lower quality than the normal prey items. The graph below shows a stable isotope biplot of nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes from a study that examined whether shark diet was affected by shark feeding.  The gray circles represent bull shark data and the black squares represent whitetip reef shark data. The "open" (or white) labels such as the diamonds, circles, squares, and inverted triangles represent their "normal" prey items. Bait of course refers to the food that divers are feeding to the sharks. Data for plankton, coral, and seagrasses are also shown (using black circles). Based on these data, which is the BEST conclusion for whether shark feeding is affecting diet of this species?

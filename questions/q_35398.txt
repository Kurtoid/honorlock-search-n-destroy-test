What happens to permanent charge as the pH of the soil increases
In the early years of the 20th century there were lush stands of tall grasses in the valley on the east side of the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona, stretching to Mexico on the south and New Mexico on the east. Dramatic summer rainstorms dumped huge amounts of water, very quickly, on the rocky upper slopes. The water ran down the slopes and into the grasslands, where it quickly soaked into the soft, porous soil where prairie dogs were active. Cattle ranching was in full swing, utilizing the rich grasses, but the ranchers did not appreciate the multitudes of prairie dogs that lived in the grasslands. Prairie dogs constantly dig through soil, making new burrows and eating grasses, roots and all.  It was commonly believed that cattle would stumble in the prairie dog holes, break legs, and die of starvation. In addition, many ranchers were convinced that the prairie dogs would destroy the grasses because they directly competed with the cattle for food. The ranchers had already done away with most predators that might possibly affect cattle, and now they turned their attention to the prairie dogs. The ranchers became a part of a new federally sponsored movement to poison the grassland prairie dogs. This movement took root and spread through the 1920s and 1930s. During the instruction and studies of this course you have read about "keystone species." How do the prairie dogs in this story meet the definition of a keystone species? A) They don't meet the definition of a keystone species; the system did fine without them. The predators turned to cattle, and the grasses did better in the compact soil. B) Their burrows loosened the soil and served as homes for other species; they helped with nutrient recycling. They helped water infiltrate into the soil and kept soil loose for grass roots. When they were removed, the system deteriorated. C) The availability of prairie dogs kept the predators in check; when they were removed, the predator populations grew dramatically. They kept the soil aerated and compact. D) When the prairie dogs were removed, the cattle declined; this meets the definition of a keystone species. E) Their burrows caused cattle to break their legs and die. This made them directly responsible for the welfare of another species, which meets the definition of a keystone species.

Last came, and last did go, The Pilot of the Galilean lake; Two massy keys he bore of metals twain (The golden opes, the iron shuts amain). He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake: "How well could I have spar'd for thee, young swain, Enow of such as for their bellies' sake Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold? Of other care they little reck'ning make Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast And shove away the worthy bidden guest.

A random sample of n = 60 individuals participated in a college success program that assessed student success. Each individual student completed 5 different assessments of student success (after 1st semester, 2nd semester, 3rd semester, 4th semester, and 5th semester). The data were analyzed to determine whether student grades improved or worsened over time. Some of the results are presented in the following summary table.  a. Complete the table by filling in the missing values.

Prove the following statement using a proof by cases.   [Hint: there are 3 cases] "For all positive integers n <= 3, n! <= n2."  Use good proof technique.   Grading rubric:1 pt. State any givens and assumptions.3 pt. Clearly identify the cases and prove each case.1 pt. State the final conclusion at the end of the proof. Note:  Remember that n factorial, written as n!, is defined as n(n-1)...(2)1, the product of n times every positive integer less than n.  To avoid the need for typing superscript exponents, you may use the expression 'n-squared' or 'n^2' to represent n2.  Also the <= symbol can be written as

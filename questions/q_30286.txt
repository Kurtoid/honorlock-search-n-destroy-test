Use the factor-label method to solve the following stoichiometry problem.   Given the following equation:  1 C3H8  +  5 O2    3 CO2  +  4 H2O If 25.7 g of CO2 are produced from this reaction, how many moles of H2O are also produced? To receive full credit:  You must use the factor unit method and the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the stoichiometric calculation.  Show your work (conversion factors/and units) by using the equation editor () in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use     to insert conversion factors. Be sure to include proper units and the final answer! Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.
A hospital reports that two patients have been admitted who have contracted Crohn's disease. Suppose our experiment consists of observing whether each patient survives or dies as a result of the disease. The simple events and probabilities of their occurrences are shown in the table (where S in the first position means that patient 1 survives, D in the first position means that patient 1 dies, etc.).                 Simple Events                      Probabilities                       SS                                            0.55                       SD                                           0.11                       DS                                           0.17                       DD                                          0.17 Find the probability that at least one of the patients does not survive.

The authors from the study described in Question 2 then studied the effect of other additives on L-Pro transport by the H. pylori putP protein (produced in E. coli).  In all cases, the same concentration of radioactive 14C L-Pro was added to cells along with 50 mM NaCl, then the accumulation of radioactivity inside cells (uptake) was measured.  The experiment was then repeated in the presence of high concentrations of each of the added compounds (done individually).  For the added compounds without standard abbreviations, structures and abbreviations are shown below.     If L-Pro uptake values >90%  can be considered no inhibition of L-Pro transport, choose the correct conclusion about the H. pylori putP protein based on these data.

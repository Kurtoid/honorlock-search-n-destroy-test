Remember, once time runs out, it is too late to upload your Simio file without significant penalty in points.  You need to stop your test a few minutes before time runs out to insure that you have time to upload your Simio (.spfx) file. Only two pages of single-sided notes are allowed.  The only scratch paper are the two pages you have for notes.  Hand held calculators are allowed, but not your cell phone.  Do not use the Math.If( ) function. When you are finished, close Simio, then upload the Simio (.spfx) file before time runs out.  Only one upload is allowed. Problem Description Parts arrive according to a Poisson process with a mean rate of 10 per hour between 6AM and noon each day.  As parts arrive, they are placed (instantaneously) in a temporary warehouse.  Each hour, at the top of the hour, starting at 7AM each day, all parts from the temporary warehouse are removed and sent to Department 501 for processing.  (Assume the move from the warehouse to Dept. 501 is instantaneous.)  Department 501 consists of two workstations:  WS A and WS B.  The travel time between the two workstations is 5 minutes.  And travel time from WS B to the leaving the department is 5 minutes. WS A consists of two single-server machines operating in parallel with one queue feeding both machines.  (In other words, each part is processed through one and only one machine within WS A.)  One of the two machines processes parts according to an exponential distribution with mean 15 minutes and the other machine processes parts according to an exponential distribution with a mean of 7.5 minutes.  WS B consists of two single-server machines (M1 and M2) operating in series (i.e., a part goes through M1 and then proceeds to M2 then leaves the workstation).  The processing time on the first machine is exponentially distributed with mean 6 minutes and the operating time on M2 for a part depends how long that part took for processing on M1 (i.e., the times onM1 and M2 are not independent).  The conditional time that a part spends on M2 given the time spent on M1 is deterministic.  Specifically, if a part spent less than 6 minutes on M1, then it will take 4.5 minutes to be processed on M2, and if a part spent 6 minutes or more on M1, then that part will take 6 minutes to be processed on M2.  Each completed part yields a profit of $50 and each hour that a part spends in Department 501 cost 75 cents.  (There is no cost associated with time spent in the temporary warehouse.)  Department 501 closes as soon as all parts that will arrive for the day have been processed through WS A and WS B.  Simulate this system to answer the following two questions:  (1) What is the average daily profit of the system? And (2) What the average time that Department 501 can close?  Put the answers to these two questions in a Floor Label.  The answer to (1) should be rounded to the nearest dollar and the answer to (2) should be rounded to the nearest minutes.  For (2) give your answer in the form hh:mm AM or hh:mm PM (i.e., use a 12-hour clock). Base your answers on 50 days of data with one replication being a single day.

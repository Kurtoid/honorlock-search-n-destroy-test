For each of the following scenarios on the left, choose from the matching answer on the right, where the first part of the answer indicates at which lapse rate ("dry" for the dry adiabatic lapse rate and "moist" for the moist or wet adiabatic lapse rate) air parcels in that scenario will change temperature. The second part indicates whether that air parcel is cooling or warming. For example, if you think the air parcel in a specific scenario would be cooling at the moist adiabatic lapse rate, you would choose "moist / cool". If you think it would be warming at the dry adiabatic lapse rate, you could choose "dry / warm".

The following are the main steps in the generation of an action potential.  Sodium channels are inactivated. Voltage-gated potassium channels open and potassium moves out of the cell, initiating repolarization. Sodium channels regain their normal properties. A graded depolarization brings an area of an excitable membrane to threshold. A temporary hyperpolarization occurs. Sodium channel activation occurs. Sodium ions enter the cell and depolarization occurs  What is the proper sequence of these events?

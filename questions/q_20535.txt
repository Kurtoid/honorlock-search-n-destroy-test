QUESTION 4         A supermarket built a ramp for their customers to push their fully loaded trolleys to their parked cars on the roof parking area above the supermarket. They completed a survey and found that the average loaded trolley has a mass of 20 kg. The material they used for the ramp resulted in a coefficient of kinetic friction of 0,7. The ramp is inclined at 20o as shown in the figure below.           Right click on the button below to open the image in a new tab.        4.1   Draw a labelled free-body diagram of all the forces acting on the trolley.

Perform the following hypothesis test :    Registered nurses earned an average annual salary of $69,110. For that same year, a survey was conducted of 41 California registered nurses to determine if the annual salary is higher than $69,110 for California nurses. The sample average was $71,121 with a sample standard deviation of $7,489.     (You may assume that the underlying population is normally distributed.)   Is this a test of one mean or proportion? [a1] State the claim in mathematical form. [a2] (This is the [a16] hypothesis.) Identify the null and alternative hypothesis. H0: [a3] HA: [a4] We will use the [a5] distribution because the population standard deviation is [a6]. Is this a left, right, or two-tailed test? Pick the matching graph. [a15] A. B. C. State the significance level. a = [a8] Calculate the p-value using technology. p-value = [a7] Compare the p-value to the significance level. p-value [a9] a, meaning that we will [a10] the H0. Therefore, because we [a11] the H0  and the original claim was the [a12], we find that there [a13] sufficient evidence to [a14] of the claim that the annual salary is higher than $69,110 for California nurses.

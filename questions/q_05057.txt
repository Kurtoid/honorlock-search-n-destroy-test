As part of a study at a large university, data were collected on n = 224 freshmen computer science (CS) majors in a particular year. The researchers were interested in modeling y, a student's grade point average (GPA) after three semesters, as a function of the following independent variables (recorded at the time the students enrolled in the university):                    = average high school grade in mathematics (HSM)                  = average high school grade in science (HSS)                  = average high school grade in English (HSE)                  = SAT mathematics score (SATM)                  = SAT verbal score (SATV)   A first-order model was fit to the data with the following results:  Test:  Ho:B1 = B2 = B3 = B4 = B5 = 0           Ha: At least one Bi not equal to 0

2.2   Lees die onderstaande atrikel en beantwoord die vrae wat volg:    Nuwe boontjievarieteite geteel om hitte te klop 26 Maart 2015 om 12:11 nm   Wetenskaplikes het 30 nuwe soorte 'hitteklopende' boontjies geteel wat ontwerp is om proteiene vir die armes van die wereld te voorsien wat aardverwarming in die gesig staar.  Boontjies word beskryf as 'vleis van die armes' en is 'n belangrike voedselbron vir meer as 400 miljoen mense in die ontwikkelende wereld, maar die gebied wat geskik is om dit te groei, kan teen 2050 met 50 persent daal as gevolg van aardverwarming, wat tienmiljoene lewens in gevaar stel. , het wetenskaplikes gese.  Sommige van die 30 nuwe soorte het ook 'n hoer ysterinhoud om hul voedingswaarde te verhoog, het CGIAR, die navorsingsgroep wat die nuwe ontdekkings ondersteun, in 'n verklaring gese.  Nuwe hitteverdraagsame bone kan die gemiddelde wereldwye temperatuurstygings van 4 grade celcuis hanteer.  Boontelers in Latyns-Amerika en Afrika suid van die Sahara - insluitend Nicaragua, Haiti, Brasilie, Honduras, Kenia, Tanzanie, Uganda en die Demokratiese Republiek Kongo - sal waarskynlik die ergste getref word deur aardverwarming, het navorsers gese.  Sommige van hierdie lande, afhanklik van kleinboere om hulself te voed, is nie in goeie posisies om aan te pas by 'n opwarmende planeet nie. Clayton Campanhola, direkteur van plantproduksie en -beskerming by die VN se Voedsel- en Landbou-organisasie, het gese dat die ontdekking van nuwe "klimaatslim" boontjiesoorte 'n groot saak is.

To combat red light running crashes many states have installed red light cameras at dangerous intersections to photograph the license plates of vehicles that run the red light. How effective are photo-red enforcement programs in reducing red-light-running crash incidents at intersections? A state's department of transportation conducted a comprehensive study of its photo-red enforcement program. In one portion of the study, the department provided crash data both before and after installation of red-light cameras at several intersections. The data(measured as the number of crashes caused by red-light-running per intersection per year) for13 intersections in a specific county, are collected. Let be the mean number of crashes caused by red light running per intersection per year before cameras were installed, be the mean number of crashes caused by red light running per intersection per year after cameras were installed, and =-. Identify the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses.

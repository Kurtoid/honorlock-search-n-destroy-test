4. (25 points total ): A motor drives a pulley at a constant speed of 1,200 RPM with a constant torque of 80 Nm, and the belt forces (B1 and B2) have been shown (experimentally) to cause a bending moment in the shaft of 100 Nm at position A. The motor shaft (d = 20 mm) is made from AISI 1045 steel (Sy = 405 MPa, Sut = 675 MPa,   = 205 MPa). It provides axial restraint for the pulley in one direction by a shoulder, which steps down to 16 mm (corner radius 0.1 mm) at position B. Once installed against the shoulder, the pulley is prevented from sliding off the end by a retaining ring at the outer end of the shaft (position D). The torque is transmitted from the shaft to the pulley by a square key, 4 mm wide and 16 mm long, in an end-milled keyseat (position C). The motor bearing is stiff enough that it you may assume that it acts as a fixed support at position A.

The effectiveness of monetary policy can be seen through the supply and demand analysis of the reserves market. a)   Referencing a basic supply and demand graph of the reserves market, briefly explain why the graph is constructed the way it is along with the various interest rates. b)   Starting with a basic graph of the reserve market in which all the interest rates are different -  Explain graphically the changes to the federal funds rate and/or borrowings (if any) if the federal reserve makes an open market purchase.  Identify the type of policy (if any) and discuss its effectiveness? c)   Starting with a supply and demand graph of the reserves market where the federal funds rate and the discount rate are the same -  Suppose the Federal Reserve is trying to entice borrowing and chooses to lower the discount rate.  Explain graphically, the resulting impact to the federal funds rate and/or borrowings if any.  Identify the type of policy and if it was effective.

In an effort to improve the selection of sizes of PC Pirate clothing, the Bookstore staff collected a random sample of data for student heights. Since the staff had taken a statistics course, the data was collected correctly (randomly) and the sample size was sufficient. A 95% confidence interval for the height of all PC students was calculated and the bookstore  staff proudly announced "We are 95% confident that the interval from 5-ft 3-inches to 5-ft 10-inches contains the true population mean height of all PC students." Let's call this confidence interval the Original confidence interval.   QUESTION: We are now going to change one thing about the data and calculate a New confidence interval. For each change to the data listed below, determine how the New confidence interval differs from the Original confidence interval.   Choose the correct result in the new confidence interval from the following list of choices. Enter only the letter of the appropriate result. S  =   The width of the New confidence interval is SMALLER (or narrower) than the Original confidence interval W =  The width of the New confidence interval is WIDER (or larger) than the Original confidence interval N  =   The width of the New confidence interval is the NOT AFFECTED by this change and it is the same as the Original confidence interval Z  =   Any differences between the New confidence interval and the Original confidence interval CANNOT BE DETERMINED from the given information.   example: The level of confidence is changed to 90% from 95%. The result of this change is  ___S___   QUESTIONS -- Here are the changes to the original data:   a.  The new sample data has a larger standard deviation among the sample heights. The result of this change is (S or W or N or Z): [A]   b.  The new sample data has a larger sample size. The result of this change is: [B]   c.  The new sample data has a larger sample mean height by 2 inches (all other statistics are the same). The result of this change is: [C]   d.  Each student's height had been 2 inches shorter than reported. The result of this change: [D]

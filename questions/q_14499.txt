27. Everyone has __________. We learn it from our culture, the media, our families, and even our faith communities. We must do the hard work of acknowledging it so that we do not inadvertently act on it. For example, medical caregivers who do not acknowledge and work on this can put their patients' lives in danger if they assume their patient is noncompliant.

Parallel Load Store Question Continued... C. Using the generated MSG, determine the load and store instructions that can be parallellized; parallelizing a pair of load/stores might preclude parallelizing another and so here's a format for answering this question:   [instruction-type label-pair] AND { [instruction-type label-pair] OR [instruction-type label-pair] }   Example (illustration only to clarify format, not pertinent to the solution):   [PLDST 3-6] AND { PSTST 2-4 OR PLDLD 1-2} means we will have a PLDTST instruction by combining instructions at labels 3 and 6 following that we could have either a PSTST instruction obtained by combining instructions at labels 2 and 4 OR (exclusive OR) a PLDLD instruction obtained by combining instructions at labels 1 and 2.   Note that while MSG shows potential parallelization possibilities, dependences determine whether instructions can actually be parallelized. Within a parallelized instruction, there can not be any dependences.   Using the MSG generated above, the following parallel instructions were generated (that is stores at instructions 2 and 3 were combined). Given this, find out which must be the Parallel-instruction-1, Parallel-instruction-2, Parallel-instruction-3 ; write your answer based on the format described above.  [PSTST 2-3] AND { Parallel-instruction-1 OR Parallel-instruction-2 OR Parallel-instruction-3}   That is, we want to know; (Please Note enter in values in ascending order, so 1-2 instead of 2-1) and using the earlier example Parallel-instruction-1 format would look like this: PSTST 2-4, you should prefer to enter the instructions in numerical order by first then second number, for example, the following example instructions PSTST 2-4, PSTST 2-5, and PSTST 3-4 are in the proper order, since they are sorted by the first number then the second number)   Parallel-instruction-1 = [parallel1] Parallel-instruction-2 = [parallel2] Parallel-instruction-3 = [parallel3]

You run a business that will supply natural gas to customers in Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, and Pensacola from distribution centers (DCs). You have three candidate DC locations to choose from (Gainesville, Lake City, and Tallahassee). Each DC has a capacity restriction that limits the number of units of gas it can supply. Each customer city has a demand that should be satisfied. Develop a single integer linear programming formulation that (when solved) will determine which DC locations to open and allocate DC capacity to the customers so as to minimize total distribution costs plus the fixed cost of the facilities that are opened. The per unit cost of distributing one unit of natural gas from each DC to each customer is shown in the table below, along with the demand and capacity levels. The fixed costs of operating DC's (if opened) in Gainesville, Lake City, and Tallahassee are $3000, $4500, and $4000, respectively. [Do not solve the problem. Just provide the formulation without any attempt to reduce complexity by solving (or partially solving) the problem.].     Tampa Orlando Jacksonville Pensacola Capacity   Gainesville $1.40 $0.95 $1.55 $3.25 1200   Lake City $1.55 $1.40 $1.20 $2.80 1800   Tallahassee $1.90 $1.75 $1.80 $2.15 1600           Demand 800 700 500 600

The following few questions related to Space X's new Starlink internet service, which promises to deliver internet connectivity to any spot on the planet via a constellation of satellites.  Each satellite is planned to be in "very low earth orbit", 340 km altitude above the ground and will use a 40 GHz signal for ground-to-satellite communication. Highly directional antennas on the transmitter and receiver will be used, each having an antenna gain of 225.  The ground-based antenna is a circular disc, 59 centimeters in diameter, as shown below.

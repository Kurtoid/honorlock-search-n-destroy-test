After reading the paragraph below, answer the questions that follow.Scientists were interested in studying differences in the frequency of foraging behaviors demonstrated in two species of flycatchers (birds) in California. They were specifically interested in determining if the overall distribution of foraging behaviors was associated with the stage of the breeding cycle of the two species. The foraging behaviors recorded were "Flycatch" which meant capturing prey while in flight, "Hover glean" which meant picking stationary prey from a substrate (tree, leaf) while flying and "glean" which meant capturing prey while perched. Here are some of the data collected:The number of foraging behaviors observed by stage of the breeding cycle (before incubating eggs, during incubation, sitting on the nest "Brooding" new hatchlings and "Post-Brooding" after the new young had left the nest) for Hammond's and Western flycatchers in northwestern CaliforniaSource: Noon, B. R., and Sakai, H. F. (1990). Variation in the foraging behaviors of two flycatchers: associations with stage of the breeding cycle. Studies in Avian Biology, 13: 237-44.What might account for the differences in numbers of foraging behaviors across the breeding cycle?

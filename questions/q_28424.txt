Reading Comprehension: Read the article below and answer the questions that follow. SETI              For as long as mankind has been around, people have looked at the stars and wondered "Is there anybody else out there?" As we learn more and more about the nature of the universe, the fundamental question remains. Are we alone in the universe, or are we just one of many planets that support life?             The scientists at the SETI Institute are using technology to try to answer the same questions. The SETI Institute is located in Mountain View, California. SETI stands for "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence," and its mission is to "explore, understand, and explain the origin, nature, and prevalence of life in the universe." The institute has been in operation since 1985 and now employs about 130 people, mainly scientists.             At SETI, scientists listen for electromagnetic signals that may be evidence of other civilizations in the universe. They collect data from giant radio telescopes located in various parts of the world, such as the Arecibo dish in Puerto Rico. They search that data for narrow-band signals that may come from an intelligent source.             The idea of alien life is popular in Hollywood. Many movies feature alien beings that come to Earth. In fact, the 1997 movie "Contact," about a young scientist who hears a signal from outer space, was based on the SETI project. However, mainstream scientists have traditionally been suspicious about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.             The scientists at SETI do not have time for skepticism. They find it completely credible that intelligent and even technologically sophisticated life exists beyond Earth. This belief is partly based on the Drake equation, which was first presented in 1961. Frank Drake estimated the probability of life elsewhere in the universe. According to his calculations, literally thousands of other planets in the universe meet the essential criteria for supporting life. SETI scientists believe that some of this life may be intelligent.             No extraterrestrials have yet been found. But the universe is a vast place. Despite the fact that SETI has been listening to radio signals since 1985, they admit that their entire search so far is equal to dipping one glass of water in the vast ocean in search for a particular type of fish. The task seems overwhelming. However, information from spacecrafts such as NASA's Kepler mission, which was launched in 2009, is making the task a little easier. The Kepler telescope is already identifying new planets that might support life. This narrows down the possibilities. In addition, the development of computers has helped speed up the search. Computers are constantly getting faster and can handle larger and larger amounts of data.             Even with supercomputers and lightning-fast processors, the search consumes time and energy. This is where "citizen scientists" enter the picture. Since 1999, the SETI@home project has used Internet-connected home computers to search for radio signals. Ordinary people volunteer to lend their computer time. Now, anyone with the Internet can take part in the SETI search. You just have to download a program that analyzes radio data.             The SETI@home project has been very successful. There are now 2 million participants in 234 countries worldwide, and the number is growing. Users compete individually and in teams to process the maximum number of work units. The results are posted on the SETI@home Web site.             It's exciting to be part of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. However, the project has prompted some scientists to suggest that it may be foolish to try to contact aliens, in particular if they may turn out to be more sophisticated than we are. World-renowned scientist Stephen Hawking has pointed out that that when an advanced society meets a less advanced one, the less advanced society tends to lose.             SETI scientists agree that this is a worthy concern, but they dismiss the criticism, pointing out that it's probably impossible for our civilization to hide from others "out there."  After all, we have been broadcasting TV and radio signals into space for many years already. The scientists remain optimistic. According to astronomer Seth Shostak, SETI should be able to answer the question of intelligent life in the next ten to fifteen years, and he expects the results to be positive. According to the SETI scientists, it's only a matter of time.

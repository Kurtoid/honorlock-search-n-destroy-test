Use the knowledge and skills learned in class to address the following scenario. A. Email to a SuperiorYou are the credit manager at Frito-Lay. Sales are down and have been for the last two quarters, and you haven't brought in a new client in just as long. Janak Mercantile Company was a promising lead given to you by your boss, Daniel Hall.  Daniel and the owner of Janak's, Lorraine Janak, are close, lifelong friends.  Your credit check of the Janak Mercantile Company told you something you didn't detect when you talked personally with Lorraine Janak about her credit application. In fact, after talking with her, you thought that the credit check would be routine and that the $14,380 order accompanying her request was certain to go through. But the credit check shows negative information. Without question, Ms. Janak has extended her credit too far. For the past year she has been slow to play, and her credit obligations are much too high. You would like to have the sale, and you need the sale. While her company does not meet the credit standards you usually use when deciding whether or not to extend credit to a new client, as the credit manager, you do have some discretion, and she is a personal friend of your boss. What do you do? Compose an email to your boss explaining your decision.

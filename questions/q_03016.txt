Overhead lighting is preferred; however, if overhead is not possible, the source of light should not be behind the student  Ensure your desk or table is cleared of all other materials.  If prompted to do a room scan, be sure to include your work area. Make sure to do a complete 360 degree rotation of your room, then show your work space. Partial scans and/or failure to show your work space may be flagged during the proctoring review.  Make sure your laptop is fully charged, or keep the charger within arm's reach.  The following items/actions are not permitted:   No writing visible on desk or on walls. No websites other than Canvas and the Honorlock proctoring extension should be used or open while taking a proctored exam.  Close all other programs and/or windows on the testing computer prior to logging into the proctored test environment.  Make sure music/televisions are not playing in the background. Communication or receiving assistance from others is not permitted during a proctored assessment. Exceptions: contacting Honorlock support or your institutions help desk.  No other persons except the test-taker should be in the room during testing. Using a phone or any other electronic device, other than your test-taking device, is not permitted.

QUESTION 6         A fun activity to do in Johannesburg is to bungee jump off the colourful Soweto Towers. Study the image and answer the questions.    Right click on the button to open an image of a person bungee jumping off the Soweto Towers  in a new window.         6.1   Identify two types of potential energy from the image.    (2)     6.2   With reference to the image, what is the difference between these two types of potential energy?   (2)     6.3   Explain the transfer of energy that takes place from when the person is stationary on the tower to when the person jumps off the tower.    (3)     6.4   How would the height of the Soweto Towers affect the gravitational potential energy of the jumper?     (3)     6.5   Calculate the jumper's potential gravitational energy if the tower is 100 m high and the jumper has a mass of 75 kg. Use the equation: Egrav = mgh Remember that g = 9,8 m/s2   (4)

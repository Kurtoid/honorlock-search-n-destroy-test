Fill in the blank III:  For Questions #21-29, fill in the blank with the appropriate choice from the list of terms below.  Only the best answer will count as the correct answer.  Each answer is used only once in this section.  You may find it useful to decide on your answer before looking for your choice in the list of terms.  If there are two blanks in a question, the same answer is used in both blanks.  Barry Bogin argued that the ______stage is found only in humans (it exists in no other mammal). It is a stage characterized by small body size, slow body growth, rapid brain growth, limited chewing ability, and a short digestive tract. This stage ends with the eruption of the first adult molar tooth In many mammalian orders, well-developed locomotor abilities enable infants to maintain proximity with their mother soon after birth (e.g. elephants and dolphins). In some mammalian orders, the infants may be placed in a protected area while the mothers forages (e.g. wolf pups in a den). However ______are different. This order of mammals has a long evolutionary history of clinging infants who are continuously transported by their mothers as she goes about her everyday activities. This may explain why "contact comfort" is especially important to infants in this mammalian order. Harry Harlow found that monkeys reared with a ________"mother" did not receive comfort by that "mother" when confronted with a fear stimulus (such as a mechanical toy). In contrast, monkeys reared with a cloth "mother" would begin to threaten the toy after receiving "contact comfort" from their cloth mother.   A similar result was found in the open field test.  A young monkey placed alone in an unfamiliar room will not explore.  After a cloth mother is placed in the room, the monkey will take comfort from contact with the cloth mother and then begin to explore his surroundings.  As described by__________, distributed caretaking of infants and young children (by mothers, fathers, grandmothers, siblings, and others) may be a normative feature of rearing newborn humans to adulthood. This contrasts with the more exclusive use of mother-care evident in chimpanzees (and most other non-human primates). In a 2015 book, The Anthropology of Childhood: Cherubs, Chattel, Changelings, ________contrasts the emphasis on early and persistent adult instruction in WEIRD societies (those that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) with the "left to find their own way" approach of adults toward children in many non-WEIRD societies. Sarah Blaffer Hrdy coined the term ___________. She concludes that the widespread use of this  kind of caretaking transformed reproduction in humans (since it allowed prolonged food dependence and slower maturation in human children). This slower maturation provides more time for social and cultural learning in humans. In the film Whale Rider, the tribal leader Koro seems to be caught in an internal emotional war. On the one hand he has strong feelings of affection for his granddaughter Pai.  On the other hand, he also has a strong sense of obligation about his duties as a leader.  He often suppresses his personal feelings for Pai in order to carry out his community obligations as he understands them.  This ability to put ___________above personal feeling demonstrates another way in which humans are distinctive from all other animals.  In Benin (as documented in the film Time for School), the local voodoo priest gave permission for one girl from each family to attend school. Nanavi's first year of school was supported by a _______, a person who visits the families of truant girls to encourage them to send their daughters to school. She also uses traditional song and dance to promote new ideas about the role of education in the lives of young girls.

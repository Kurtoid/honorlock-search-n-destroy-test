Assuming the centripetal force is constant (constant hanging mass), what effect does radius have on the magnitude of the velocity (speed)  of a rotating object?
We are given the following square dartboard with side length = 2 units, with a circle of radius 1 unit inscribed in it and a certain region shaded red (namely, the bottom half of the square + the upper semi-circle, as shown in the picture). Suppose we throw 1000 darts on the given square dartboard and 892 of them land in the red area. Use this information to estimate p.

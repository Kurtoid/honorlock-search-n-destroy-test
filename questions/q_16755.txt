A valid repeated measures ANOVA (rANOVA) was conducted to study the relative effectiveness of three teaching methods used to help third grade students remember vocabulary words. The teaching methods were using flashcards (Method1), completing a worksheet (Method2), and watching an instructional video (Method3). Twenty students were selected, and each student took turns using each one of the three methods to help learn a set of vocabulary words (a Latin square design was used). After a student used an assigned method, he or she took a test over that particular set of vocabulary words. SPSS was used to conduct a repeated measures ANOVA to analyze the vocabulary test scores, and a portion of the SPSS output is provided in the following tables. Refer to the tables as needed to complete this problem. Table 3A    Table 3B    Table 3C    Do the following:  Discuss the result of Mauchly's Test of Sphericity and the implication for the repeated measures ANOVA. State the null and alternative hypotheses for the repeated measures ANOVA test, make a decision about the null hypothesis, and write a conclusion statement. If appropriate, use the Bonferroni post hoc analysis to identify all pairs of treatment means that are statistically significantly different. Justify your conclusions.

Boxcar interactions You observe three boxcars interact in a freight yard outside Kansas City.    Boxcar X initially has speed [vv] m/s as it moves to the right toward the other two boxcars.  Its mass is [mx] kg. The other two boxcars, U and H, are hooked together and initially at rest, and they are loaded identically, each with mass [mg] kg.  Boxcar X slams into the boxcar U, latches to U, and the three boxcars move off together, to the right at a new speed, vnew. Calculate the new speed, vnew. Type in the numeric part of your answer to the nearest 0.01 m/s of rightward speed.  E.g., if your new speed is 22.387 m/s, then type 22.39 in the answer box.

12. Rock Cycle Fill in the numbered and lettered blanks in the rock cycle shown below.  The numbered blanks will be filled in with the names of the 3 main rock types (one is subdivided into a and b) and one other material that is not yet a rock.  The letters on the arrows refer to the name of the process forming these rocks/materials. Lastly, there are some arrows not yet drawn.  Normally I'd have you draw these in and label them, but since you can't do that on an online drawing, I want you to describe where the needed arrows would go from and to, and what process you would label them with. Hint 1: Numbers 1a and 2 are formed at the Earth's surface, 3 is formed fairly close to the surface, and 1b and 4 are usually formed deep within the earth. Hint 2: For A and B, there are 2 arrows, but consider them as one set of processes.  For A, B, C, D,and E, there are a number of possible correct answers, and more than one will be accepted. Spelling counts.  If you mis-spell an answer, you will not receive full credit.  Figure 14 1a: [1a]                                A: [A]1b: [1b]                               B: [B]2: [2]                                     C: [C]3: [3]                                     D: [D]4: [4]                                     E: [E] What arrows are missing from this drawing, and what process happens in them?[MissingArrows] I will go over these to make sure that you get as much credit as possible.

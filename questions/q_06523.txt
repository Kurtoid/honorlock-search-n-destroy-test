1. [40 points] Consider a 4-period lot sizing problem with the demand vector D = (15,30,20,25). The fixed production setup cost is $55, the unit variable production cost is $5, and the unit inventory holding cost is $2 per period. Assume that the initial inventory level and the ending inventory level must be zero. Find the optimal lot sizing schedule for this setting  I. [20 points] using the Wagner-Whitin Algorithm. II. [20 points] using the Least Unit Cost Heuristic.      2. [30 points] A bakery bakes fresh doughnuts every morning. Production cost is 35 cents per doughnut, and they are sold for 65 cents each. Unsold doughnuts at the end of the day are purchased by a charity kitchen for 10 cents each. The daily demand for doughnuts is a random variable with the discrete distribution shown in the table below.        Number of doughnuts sold in one day   Probability     0   0.03     5   0.07     10   0.10     15   0.10     20   0.10     25   0.15     30   0.12     35   0.12     40   0.11     45   0.10       I. [15 points] How many doughnuts should the bakery make at the start of each day? II. [15 points] Assume there is a unit loss-of-goodwill cost of 20 cents for unmet demand. How many doughnuts should the bakery make at the start of each day?     3. [30 points] Persepolis is the only computer store in Gainesville that sells D-6-0-52 laptops. Once every month, a shipment of the laptops is made to Persepolis. The laptops cost Persepolis for $650 each, and they are sold for $900 each. Since Persepolis is the only seller of this laptop model, unmet demands are backordered from one month to the next. The unit loss-of-goodwill is estimated to be $40. The annual inventory holding cost is $156 per laptop. From experience, it appears that the demand for D-6-0-52 laptops over a month is normally distributed with mean of 40 and variance of 49. I. [15 points] Determine the optimal order-up-to level for D-6-0-52 laptops for Persepolis. II. [15 points] Suppose there is another computer store that sells these laptops which means if Persepolis is out of stock, the customers go and buy their laptop from the other store (there is no backorder). Now determine the optimal order-up-to level for D-6-0-52 laptops for Persepolis.

The ability to bark while trailing prey is a dominant trait in certain breeds of dogs. Keeping silent while trailing prey is recessive. Having Erect ears while trailing prey is dominant and having droopy ears while trailing prey is a recessive trait. A male dog heterozygous for the barking trait but homozygous recessive for the ear trait mates with a female dog that is homozygous  recessive for both traits.  You are required to use the letters as indicated below (5 points total): B=Barking  b=silent  E=erect ears  e=droopy ears   ADDRESS all prompts below (fully)   Examine the two types of punnet squares (see images below). Which type must you use to compute the genetic problem Answer as follows: 4 or 16 squares (.5 points)?            2. List the genotype of the male dog. .5 points   3. Foil the alleles from the male genotype to illustrate the possible genotypes of gametes produced. List them. .5 points (separate each type by using a common)   4. List the genotype of the female dog. .5 points    5. Foil the alleles from the female genotype to illustrate the possible genotypes of gametes produced. List them. .5 points (separate each type by using a common)   6. List the phenotype ratio of the cross (numbers and description of offspring as explained in the Lecture PP Navigation slides). 3 points

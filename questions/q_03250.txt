There are a number of filter and attenuator theories of attention in cognitive psychology including some that posit multiple filters. The multiple filter theories were designed to account for behavioral evidence that does not seem to support theories where only a single (early or late) filter or attenuator is present. Neuroscience data has provided some insight into how these theories correspond to brain function. The image below depicts the oddball task (also called the auditory attentional stream paradigm). Consider the following ERP waves observed in this task: N100 (or N1), MMN, and the P300. Describe the affects of attention on two of these waves and to what degree they resemble the early, middle, or late filters or attenuators described by cognitive theories of attention.

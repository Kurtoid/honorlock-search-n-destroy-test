Section 8: Urban Growth/City Size Suppose a region's workforce of 12 million is initially evenly split between two cities, X and Y . The urban growth utility curve peaks at 4 million workers, and beyond that point the slope is - $5 per million workers (as the number of workers increases by a million workers, the utility drops by $5). The initial equilibrium utility level is $80. Suppose city X experiences technological innovation that shifts its utility curve upward by $10. Explain your answers to all question in this section. Correct answer gives you 50% of points and explanation of your answer gives you 50% of points.  [6 points] In the new equilibrium, the utility level is ______________ and the population of X is ______________ million, while the population of Y is ______________ million. [6 points] Identify the direction of migration immediately following city X experiences technological innovation and explain your answer.

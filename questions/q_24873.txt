You conduct a two-sided hypothesis test (a = 0.05): H0: u = 25 and HA: u [?] 25. You collect data from a population of size N = 150 and compute a test statistic Z = - 2.4.  The null hypothesis is actually false and u = 23. Determine which of the following statements are true.  Hint: Assume the test statistic follows a Z distribution. I. The two-sided p-value is 0.0164.

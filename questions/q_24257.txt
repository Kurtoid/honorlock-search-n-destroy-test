Skill C1.  Consider a production line (the "board fab line") that has two workstations that make printed circuit boards.  Boards go from the MMOD workstation to the SIP workstation. The MMOD workstation processes printed circuit boards using one machine; using this machine, the average effective processing time is 71 minutes (per board), and the process time SCV = 0.2.  Boards arrive at the rate of 0.84 boards per hour.  The arrival SCV = 0.8.  After the MMOD workstation, the printed circuit boards go to a second workstation (SIP) at which the boards are processed by two machines (working in parallel).  At this workstation, the average effective processing time is 60 minutes (per part), and the process time SCV = 2.0.  What is the cycle time of this production line (in minutes)?What is the WIP of this production line?

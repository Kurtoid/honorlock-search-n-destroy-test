Mia has 8 sweatshirts (s) and 10 hoodies (h). The price of sweatshirts (P_s) is currently $10 per unit, and the price of hoodies (P_h) is currently $20 per unit. Mia's demand function for sweatshirts is:    where m is the value of his endowment. Mia has no other income besides his endowment. The sweatshirt (s) is placed on the horizontal axis. (a) What is her endowment point? What is the initial value of Mia's endowment? How many sweatshirts would Mia consume? (b) Find the slope, x-intercept, and y-intercept of Mia's budget line before the price change. (c) Suppose the price of sweatshirts increases to $15. After the price change, what are Mia's monetary income and her consumption of sweatshirts? (d) Using the Slutsky equation, break up the change in Mia's demand for sweatshirts into the substitution effect, ordinary income effect, and the endowment income effect. Calculate the value of each effect. (e) We don't know what Mia's indifference curves look like but let's assume they are "well-behaved" and don't have any "kinks." Let's also assume Mia satisfies both axioms of revealed preference. Is it possible that she would consume more sweatshirts after the price change? Explain in terms of the axioms of revealed preference.

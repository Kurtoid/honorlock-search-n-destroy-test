You can use MATLAB either through UF Apps or if you have student license downloaded version of it. Here is the link for UF Apps: https://info.apps.ufl.edu/Links to an external site. The compound interest equation shows how much a given amount of 'money' will be worth after t years (t is a positive integer) based on the interest rate r (r is in decimals) :   [in case image above is not visible, here is the formula:                                        future_value = money*(   (1 + r/12)^12t  )  ] First ask the user for How much Money: and Interest Rate (percent):  Then, write a program to display how many years will it take to make their 'money' at least x-times of the given 'money' (x is positive integer greater than 1 given by the user). For example, if x is 2, that means double the 'money', if x = 4, that means quadruple 'money'.  (Note: the user will give r in %age but you need to divide it by 100 and then use it in the formula) money = input('How much Money: ');r = input('Interest rate (percent): ');x = input('How many times do you want to make your money? ');   Test Case 1: How much Money: 100Interest rate (percent): 12How many times do you want to make your money? 2It will take 6 years to make your money 2 times!    Test Case 2: How much Money: 100Interest rate (percent): 12How many times do you want to make your money? 4It will take 12 years to make your money 4 times!    Test Case 3: How much Money: 5000Interest rate (percent): 36How many times do you want to make your money? 10It will take 7 years to make your money 10 times!

Consider the following C loop and its translation to RISC-V assembly code, where x5 and x6 contain the starting address of the arrays X and Y, respectively.  Assume that the processor has a maximum vector length of 64.  Assume that all the vector RV64V registers and the scalar RISC-V integer registers not referenced are available for use in the loop.  Rewrite the RISC-V code below to vectorize the loop using RV64V assembly instructions.  In the table below is the form of RV64V instructions that you may find useful.  Note you do not have to enable or disable vector registers. /* C code */for (i = 0; i < 200; i++)   Y[i] = X[i]*Y[i] + a;/* RISC-V code */   fld    f2,a   addi   x4,x5,#1600loop:   fld    f1,0(x5)   fld    f3,0(x6)   fmul.d f1,f1,f3   fadd.d f1,f1,f2   fsd    f1,0(x6)   addi   x5,x5,#8   addi   x6,x6,#8   bne    x5,x4,loop    Instruction Operands Function   vadd v1,v2,f0 Add elements of v2 and f0 and put result in v1.   vmul v1,v2,v3 Multiply elements of v2 and v3 and put result in v1.   vld v1,x1 Load vector register v1 from memory starting at address x1.   vst v1,x1 Store vector register v1 into memory starting at address x1.   setvl x1,x2 Move min(MVL,x2) to vector-length register vl and x1.

Q#2. Mendel's contribution to modern biology included his understanding that  the units of inheritance (now called genes or alleles) are discrete and stable as they are passed from parent to offspring the units of inheritance are not always expressed in the organism providing the basis for distinguishing recessive allele vs. dominant allele and genotype vs. phenotype  the units of inheritance are paired in parents but separate during the production of gametes (Law of Segregation).  Pairing is restored when a sperm fertilizes and an egg and the development of a new individual begins.  during the production of gametes (eggs and sperm) via meiosis, the assortment of alleles controlling one trait is independent of the assortment of alleles controlling any other trait making new combinations of traits possible in gametes and in the offspring they produce (Law of Independent Assortment). This provides one reason the offspring of a single pair of sexually-reproducing parents can be so variable (so different from one another) despite having the same parents. all of these statements identify Mendel's contributions to our understanding of genetic inheritance

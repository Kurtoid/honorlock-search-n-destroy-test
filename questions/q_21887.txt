Key equations and a Periodic Table to be used for the whole quiz are included below:pH = -log[H3O+]pH + pOH = 14[H3O+][OH-]=1.0 x 10-14Kw=1.0 x 10-14pKa=-log(Ka)pKa + pKb=14   A solution of the hypothetical weak acid, H2X, is created by placing 0.00800 moles of H2X into 2.0 L of total solution. At equilibrium, the concentration of HX- and H3O+ are both 3.00 x 10-5 M and the equilibrium concentration of H2X is 0.00397 M. Based on this information, answer each of the following questions and type your final answer for each part into the essay box below. Upload your work after closing the exam.

The cardiotonic steroids, digitoxin and ouabain used in low dosages, help to increase the strength of the heartbeat in heart muscle cells. These drugs act by increasing the Na+ concentration in the cytosol and the cell compensates for the increased Na+ by activating Na+-Ca2+ exchanger resulting in a high concentration of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (endoplasmic reticulum) of the heart muscle cell. Which of the following if inhibited would lead to an INCREASE in Na+ concentration in the cytosol of the heart muscle cell? In other words, what is the cellular target for these drugs?

According to Equivalence Class Partitioning, what are the partitions for heart rate (HR)?Valid HR is Greater than or Equal to 0 (zero) and Equal to or Less than 200. HR is considered high if Greater than 150? HR is an integer. (2p) Consider the test cases you defined in the MC/DC question elsewhere in this test. Assume that the expression is embedded in a function with input validation where negative input and input larger than 200 is rejected and has been tested to be working. Assume that A means (HR>150), that B means (System==On), and that C means (Session==Started). Populate the test cases with values for HR, System and Session, derived using basic Boundary Value Analysis and the partitions you defined above). Note: System and Session are binary. How many populated test cases do we need? Provide all unpopulated  as well as populated test cases. Show your calculations and provide clear links between unpopulated  and populated test cases and motivate your answers. Use Table Option, below, if needed. (5p).   Max 200 words, excluding tables.

Their relationship is terribly strained and notwithstanding that they have both been trying to be civil towards each other the relationship is getting worse and worse.  The lease is almost up--only 4 months to go.  Both Cora and Sophia can't wait to say good bye.  Last night, Cora came across a super charming one bedroom unit, totally upgraded, in walking distance from Sophia's work, at a very reasonable rent.  The unit will go super fast--it is too good to last.  Sophia appreciated Cora's kindness in pointing out this unit.  It must have been difficult to be so nice.  Sophia decided to take it but needed to sign a lease immediately starting in 10 days.  Cora told Sophia--take it and go--I agree you should move as soon as possible!

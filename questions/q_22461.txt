Question 6 (14 points): Metal cutting A researcher urgently needs an aluminum L bracket and decides to fabricate one using the end milling process. The bracket is machined out of a solid block of metal that is 350 mm long, 50 mm wide and 50 mm thick. The specific energy of cutting this metal is 2 Ws/mm3. Cutting was performed through a series of end milling operations wherein the radial depth of cut was 2 mm, axial depth of cut was 2.5 mm and the feed rate was 20 mm/s. The rotational speed of the tool was 25,000 rpm and the tool diameter was 6 mm. The side edges of the L bracket are 25 mm long (i.e., the width of the sides that form the L shape as measured on the exterior surfaces is 25 mm), the length of the bracket is 250 mm and the thickness of the bracket is 5 mm (i.e., the width of material between the internal and external faces of the L is 5 mm).   Answer the following questions. Show your work and provide justifications. (a) What was the material removal rate? (4 pt) (b) How much power was required during cutting? (4 pt) (c) How much energy was required to make a single L bracket? (6 pt)

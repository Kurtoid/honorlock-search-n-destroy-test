Stepping on a sand spur activated a nociceptor which activates a sensory pathway for pain.  This information travels to the brain through a/n [pathway] spinal pathway.  This pathway initially enters the spinal cord through a/n [horn] grey horn on side of the spinal cord that is [side1] to the nociceptor.  In terms of decussation, this pathway [decussation].  This means the pathway travels up the side of the spinal cord that is [side2] to the nociceptor.  Because this sensory pathway originates in the foot, it enters the spinal cord through the [plexus] plexus, which is associated with spinal nerves [nerves].

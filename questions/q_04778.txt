Label Q-pH (6 min.) You must show all your work for this problem on your paper.  You must show starting variables, starting equations, and use one step equation dimensional analysis where applicable.  In addition to showing you work on paper, you must state you final answer(s) here with units.  Failure to do so will result in zero credit regardless of your work on paper. Calculate the pH of the solution above after adding  25.0 mL 0.10 M HCl to a buffer solution prepared from a  0.110 M solution of a weak acid and a 0.220 M solution of the salt of this weak acid.  Assume no changes due to volume.  The Ka of the weak acid is 6.30 x 10-5. Show your work and upload for grading. Place final answer here.

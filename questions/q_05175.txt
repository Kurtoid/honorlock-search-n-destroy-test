Read the following scenario: Naomi has a big test in her introduction to Psychology course on Friday this week covering the first 3 chapters and lectures. It's her first college exam and she is feeling nervous. Plus, it's worth 20% of her final grade! She knows that studying is going to be key, so she blocks off her whole Thursday evening to study. When she finally gets home from school and volleyball practice, it's about 5pm. She eats dinner with her family, and hits the books at about 6. She's been keeping up with the chapter readings, and watched all the lectures in Canvas as they were available, so she thinks she has a good head start. She took as many notes as she could during the lectures, and almost got all the information down. She figured she would skim these later. The first thing she does is pull out some multicolored note cards and thinks "I'm going to write down each bold definition in the 3 chapters. I can then review them." She opens her e-book, and her phone buzzes. It's a SnapChat from Amy, her best friend. She quickly sends a Snap back. Out of habit, now that she's picked up her phone, and opens Instagram. She sees a pair of shoes that she likes and goes back to her laptop and opens a new tab. She has about 40 definitions to write, and by 7:30, she's got them all finished, but she's also sent 15 Snaps to Amy, put 3 pairs of shoes in a shopping cart, and discovered a band she likes will be coming to town at the end of the month. When reviewing the definitions, she thinks "none of these things relate to my life, or each other as far as I can tell!" She recalls from a learning style quiz that she is an auditory learner, so she reads the definitions out loud. She also reads her notes from the lectures out loud to herself. She "rewards" herself after reading each definition with a "break." These breaks involve getting some water, going to the bathroom, checking social media, texting friends, and watching youtube videos. She finishes this around 10:00pm and decides to go to bed. She logs into Canvas for her Proctored Exam the next day, scans the test questions, and gets a sinking feeling in her stomach. The test requires her to select the correct term for a given scenario. She didn't really know how these terms connected to each other, or anything else, for that matter. In the space below, explain things Naomi could have done to have avoided this scenario and how she could have studied to increase her learning.

Read this scenario and determine if the inferences listed below are true:    Years ago, the United States Armed Forces conducted an experiment called "Operation Snowdrop" to find out what kinds of military personnel seemed to function best under severe arctic climatic conditions.  Some of the factors examined were weight, age, blood pressure, and national origin.  All of the participants in "Operation Snowdrop" were given a training course in how to survive and function in extreme cold.  At the conclusion, of the experiment, it was found that only two factors among those studied distinguished between personnel whose performance was rated as "effective" and those rated as "not effective" on the arctic exercises.  These factors were:  (1) the desire to participate in the experiment, and (2) the degree of knowledge and skill regarding how to live and protect oneself under arctic conditions.  Question 4:   Despite the training course given to all of the participants in "Operation Snowdrop" some participants exhibited greater arctic survival knowledge or skill than others.

QUESTION 3     A hot air balloon rises vertically at a constant velocity. When the hot air balloon reaches point A, a few meters above the ground, a man in the hot air balloon drops a ball that hits the ground and bounces. Ignore the effects of friction. The velocity-time graph attached represents the motion of the ball from the moment it is dropped until after it bounces for the first time. The time interval between the different times it bounces is ignored. THE UPWARD DIRECTION IS TAKEN AS POSITIVE. USE INFORMATION FROM THE GRAPH AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT FOLLOW.   Right click on the following blue button to open the diagram in a new tab.       3.1   What does the term free fall mean?   (2)     3.2   Write down the magnitude of the velocity of the hot air balloon.   (1)     3.3   Calculate the height above the ground from which the ball was dropped.   (3)     3.4   Calculate the time at point P indicated on the graph.   (2)     3.5   Calculate the maximum height that the ball reaches after it bounces for the first time.   (3)     3.6   Calculate the distance between the ball and the hot air balloon when the ball is at its maximum height after it first bounced.   (4)             [15]

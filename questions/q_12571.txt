The table above shows the addresses in hex (base 16) and the contents at the corresponding address in binary (base 2). A.) Interpret the contents at address 0x0C0C as two ASCII characters. [ascii] B.) Interpret the contents at the same address as A.) above as an unsigned integer. [unsigned] C.) Interpret the contents at address 0x0C0E as an LC-3 instruction to determine the operation.(Enter either ADD, JMP, LDR, or OTHER if it is not one of the first 3) [instr1] Recall that a "pointer" is a memory location that stores an address. We call it a pointer since the address it stores "points" to another memory location. D.) Interpret the contents at address 0x0C0B as a pointer.(Enter hex like the following example: 0x2A3F) [ptrvalue] E.) What are the contents of the memory location that the pointer above is pointing to?(Enter hex like the following example: 0x2A3F) [ptevalue]   REFERENCE: Partial Table of Hex to ASCII Characters:  20 sp 30 0 40 @ 50 P 60 ` 70 p 21 ! 31 1 41 A 51 Q 61 a 71 q 22 " 32 2 42 B 52 R 62 b 72 r 23 # 33 3 43 C 53 S 63 c 73 s 24 $ 34 4 44 D 54 T 64 d 74 t Table of LC-3 Opcodes in Hex:  ADD 0x1 JMP 0xC LDR 0x6

The following question came from the Mastering Biology homework. Which of the following statements is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics? (a) A gain of free energy in a system is always associated with conversion of energy from one form to another.(b) Every energy transformation performed by an organism decreases the entropy of the universe.(c) Without an input of energy, the entropy of an organism would tend to decrease over time.(d) A constant input of energy is required to maintain the high level of cellular organization. Explain what is wrong with the statements made in (a), (b), and (c). (No, you do not need to know the second law of thermodynamics in order to explain what is wrong with these statements. Also, no points will be awarded if you merely state the opposite of the answer choice. You must demonstrate in your answer that you understand the material by adequately explaining what is wrong with the statements.)

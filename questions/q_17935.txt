They each executed a written agreement, which included a merger clause and a no-oral-modification (NOM) clause (together, a "zipper clause"). On April 15, the Delta sales manager telephoned the Echo purchasing manager and stated, "a drought has seriously affected some of my suppliers, and I am uncertain whether I will be able to deliver on time. Any help you can give me in extending the delivery date to July 1 would be very much appreciated." The Echo purchasing manager agreed on the phone to change the delivery date to July 1, as requested.

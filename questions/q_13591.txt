(1) (8 points) Each answer is worth two points. Clearly write and label your answers on your paper. (a) True or False. If a beam cross-section is in a state of pure bending, the internal shear force V(x) on that cross-section will be zero. ______________ (b) True or False. The section modulus of a beam is a single parameter that describes the geometry of the beam cross-section. _____________ (c) When computing maximum stresses in a steel reinforced concrete beam, it is assumed that the concrete has _____________ (large, small, zero) strength in tension. (d) Consider a composite beam made of materials 1 and 2 subjected to a positive internal bending moment. The graph below shows the distribution of the _________________ (Young's modulus, elastic stiffness, normal stress, normal strain) within the cross-section.

Why is it important, when first encountering a poem, to consider its title?
Phage therapy, the use of viruses which infect and destroy bacteria, is being considered as an alternative treatment for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. 20 Caucasian male patients having multi-drug resistant MRSA infections participated in a study to evaluate this possibility. 10 of these subjects received standard oral phage therapy, while the other 10 received a placebo (sugar pill). The data generated by this study is illustrated in the graph below:    A. Identify the dependent and independent variables for this experiment. B. Formulate an appropriate scientific hypothesis for this experiment.  C. Based on the data displayed in the graph, do you reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis? Explain your answer.

The circled structure is:
The Mexican "Army of Operations" included women who followed the army out of Mexico.
Large samples of women and men are  obtained, and the hemoglobin level is measured in each subject. Here is the  95% confidence interval for the difference between the two population  means, where the measures from women correspond to population 1 and the measures from men correspond to population  2:   -1.76 g/dL

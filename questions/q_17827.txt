At the beginning of anaphase, there is a surge of Ca2+. Following this, [option1] contributes to the degradation of [option2] by adding ubiquitin molecules to the protein. Once the protein is degraded, [option3], the protease that it regulates, is released. This protease then cleaves [option4], which is bound to sister chromatids, holding them together until anaphase. This final step triggers anaphase separation of the sister chromatids.

THIS CONTENT IS PROTECTED AND MAY NOT BE SHARED, UPLOADED, SOLD, OR DISTRIBUTED Problem 2. - 8 Points total - (a) = 2 pt; (b) = (c) = 3 pts. A direct band-gap compound semiconductor material used for optoelectronics applications that grows in the zinc-blende crystal structure has a lattice constant of [a] A. Let the two atomic species of this compound semiconductor be A and B having the following atomic weights: A = [x] g/mol and B = [y] g/mol, respectively. For your reference, Avogadro's number is NA = 6.02 x 10+23 atoms per gram molecular weight. Calculate: (a) the distance from the center of atom A to the center of its nearest B neighbor; (b) the number density of A and B atoms (#/cm3); (c) the mass density (g/cm3) of the AB semiconductor

You can use MATLAB either through UF Apps or if you have student license downloaded version of it. Here is the link for UF Apps: https://info.apps.ufl.edu/Links to an external site. The compound interest equation shows how much a given amount of 'money' will be worth after t years (t is a positive integer) based on the interest rate r (r is in decimals) :   [in case image above is not visible, here is the formula:                                        future_value = money*(   (1 + r/12)^12t  )  ] First ask the user for How much Money: and Interest Rate (percent):  Then, write a program to display how many years will it take to make their 'money' at least x-times of the given 'money' (x is positive integer greater than 1 given by the user). For example, if x is 2, that means double the 'money', if x = 4, that means quadruple 'money'.  (Note: the user will give r in %age but you need to divide it by 100 and then use it in the formula) money = input('How much Money: ');r = input('Interest rate (percent): ');x = input('How many times do you want to make your money? ');   Test Case 1: How much Money: 100Interest rate (percent): 12How many times do you want to make your money? 2It will take 6 years to make your money 2 times!    Test Case 2: How much Money: 100Interest rate (percent): 12How many times do you want to make your money? 4It will take 12 years to make your money 4 times!    Test Case 3: How much Money: 5000Interest rate (percent): 36How many times do you want to make your money? 10It will take 7 years to make your money 10 times!    Test Case 4: How much Money: 7633Interest rate (percent): 4How many times do you want to make your money? 6It will take 45 years to make your money 6 times!    Test Case 5: How much Money: 123Interest rate (percent): 6.5How many times do you want to make your money? 23It will take 49 years to make your money 23 times!    Test Case 6: How much Money: 333Interest rate (percent): 18How many times do you want to make your money? 10000It will take 52 years to make your money 10000 times!

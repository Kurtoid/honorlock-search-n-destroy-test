Students in a certain school district are each allowed to choose one of three learning modes: in-person, hybrid, or remote. At the end of the academic year, all students are given a comprehensive assessment to determine whether they have met, exceeded, or fallen below expectations for their grade level. Results from a random sample of 125 students were analyzed to determine whether an association exists between assessment outcomes and learning mode.  The results are presented below. Use the SPSS output to complete this problem.      Test of Independence: H0: Assessment results are independent of learning mode. Ha: There is an association between assessment results and learning mode.  The P-value for the chi-square test of independence is P=[b]. If the test is conducted at the .05 level of significance, then one should [c] ("reject" or "fail to reject") the null hypothesis. Is the sample evidence sufficient to conclude that there is an association between assessment results and learning mode? [y] ("yes" or "no") What is the expected count for the cell corresponding to in-person learners who exceed expectations? [d] (give exact value in decimal form) What is the standardized residual for the cell corresponding to in-person learners who exceed expectations? [e] (round to two decimals) What is the expected count for the cell corresponding to remote learners who were below expectations? [f] (give exact value in decimal form) What is the standardized residual for the cell corresponding to remote learners who were below expectations? [g] (round to two decimals) In a test such as this, a standardized residual is considered significant if its absolute value is greater than [h]. In general, the degrees of freedom for a chi-square test of independence depends on the number of categories for both the row variable and column variable. If such a test were conducted with a row variable having 3 categories and a column variable having 6 categories, then the degrees of freedom would be [n].

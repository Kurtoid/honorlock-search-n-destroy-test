Assume now that Dave Wang files a complaint against Lo Depot in the Federal District Court for the District of New Mexico alleging a violation of the National Retailer Tort Claims Act.  Also assume that Lo Depot properly impleads Mr. Remington.  Upon learning that Mr. Remington has been joined to the action, the Wangs' lawyer consults them to see if Dave would like to now make claims against Mr. Remington.  While awaiting the Wangs' response, the partner asks another associate to draft a complaint by Dave Wang against Mr. Remington for product liability.  Any negligence or product liability claims are covered by the New Mexico Products Liability Act (the "NMPLA").  N.Mex. Code Ann. SS 29-28-102(6) (defining "product liability action[s]" as "all actions brought for or on account of personal injury, death or property damage caused by or resulting from the manufacture, construction, design, formula, preparation, assembly, testing, service, warning, instruction, marketing, packaging or labeling of any product").  To state a claim under the NMPLA, a plaintiff must allege facts allowing a court to infer that "(1) the product was defective and/or unreasonably dangerous, (2) the defect existed at the time the product left the manufacturer's control, and (3) the plaintiff's injury was proximately caused by the defective product." Sigler v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 532 F.3d 469, 483 (10th Cir. 2008). A product is in a "defective condition" when its state "renders it unsafe for normal or anticipatable handling and consumption[.]" N.Mex. Code Ann. SS 29-28-102(2). An injury is not proof of a defect. Maness v. Bos. Scientific, 751 F.Supp.2d 962, 969 (D.N.M. 2010) ("Even assuming that the [product] injured the Plaintiff, that is not enough to show that the [product] was defective or unreasonably dangerous"). A product is "unreasonably dangerous" when it is   dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics, or that the product because of its dangerous condition would not be put on the market by a reasonably prudent manufacturer or seller, assuming that the manufacturer or seller knew of its dangerous condition.  N.Mex.Code Ann. SS 29-28-102(8).   For any NMPLA action, "a plaintiff must show that there was something wrong with the product, and trace the plaintiff's injury to the specific defect." King v. Danek Med., Inc., 37 S.W.3d 429, 435 (N.Mex.Ct.App. 2000). A manufacturer or seller is not liable "unless there is a showing that the particular defect or dangerous condition proximately caused the plaintiff's injury." Id.; Maness, 751 F.Supp.2d at 970 ("The relevant question is not whether the [product] caused [the injury]; the issue is whether the alleged defective design or manufacturing of the [product] caused [the injury].") (emphasis in original).  Thus, at the pleading stage, a plaintiff must allege facts indicating "how" the alleged defect caused her injuries. Tilden v. Gen. Elec. Co., No. 3:11-cv-628, 2012 WL 1023617, at *4-5 (D.N.M. Mar. 26, 2012). Simply alleging that she suffered injuries from the product "is not enough." Id. at *5.   Moreover, in order to state a claim under the NMPLA, the plaintiff must show causation by pleading facts which "trace" the alleged injuries to the alleged defect. King, 37 S.W.3d at 435; see, e.g., Tilden, 2012 WL 1023617, at *5 (pleading "defectiveness and the injury related to the defect" is an insufficient basis to infer causation); Maness, 751 F.Supp.2d at 970 (A plaintiff must "allege facts for the court to infer that the condition of the device--based upon an alleged design or manufacturing defect--caused her alleged injuries.") (emphasis in original); Westfield Ins. Co. v. Broan-Nutone, L.L.C., No. 1-10-0110, 2011 WL 9048, at *2 (N.M.N. Jan. 3, 2011) ("no question" of how product caused injury where the plaintiff pled that a defective ceiling fan caught fire and burned property).   The complaint drafted by your fellow associate sets forth Dave Wang's factual basis for his product liability claim against Mr. Remington--in pertinent part--as follows:    P 5 ...On or about the 12th day of November, 2015, at or about 10:00 p.m., Plaintiff Dave Wang was burned by a heater manufactured by Mr. Remington, Inc.  Dave Wang suffered greatly as a result of the burn injury referenced herein.   P 6  The Mr. Remington heater used by Dave Wang malfunctioned and his camping tent caught fire....   P 8. Plaintiff Dave Wang avers that the sole, direct and proximate cause of the burning of, and serious injury to, Dave Wang was the negligence of the product manufacturing in that Mr. Remington, Inc. failed to:   (a)  Properly design the heater in question in a manner in which would have prevented the occurrence of this incident; (b)  Design and provide a flame guard sufficient to prevent the incident and resulting injuries to Dave Wang as referenced herein; (c)  Provide sufficient, clear and meaningful instructions concerning the use of the product by ordinary consumers; (d)  Provide reasonable and meaningful cautions and warnings which would have advised the ordinary product consumer, such as Dave Wang, about the possibility of occurrences of this type and which would have also advised said ordinary consumers about the injurious consequences which could easily result in the event that the warnings were not followed; and (e)  Provide any warnings of any kind or type which would advise the ordinary consumer about the dangers of the product in question and which dangers were known or should have been known by the said manufacturing defendant, Mr. Remington.

Their power comes from their authority  to create  regulations (legislative), the ability to  enforce those regulations (executive) and their ability to adjudicate violations of these regulations (judicial).

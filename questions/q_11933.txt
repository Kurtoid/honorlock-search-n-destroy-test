April is considering buying a phone answering machine that picks up the phone and automatically schedules a meeting with the caller on a day that doesn't exist (i.e. February 30th) so she never has to do it again. The machine has a fixed cost of $150 a day and variable costs per hour of $10. She tells her boss Ron about her plan, and he is all for it as a way to make the office less efficient but he doesn't know if they will be able to convince the city manager, Chris.  Ron says the parks and recreation department pays April $18 an hour and has estimated her cost of benefits at $100 a work day regardless of how many hours she works.

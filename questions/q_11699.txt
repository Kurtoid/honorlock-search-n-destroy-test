On blank paper (or graph paper, if you have some already out), draw a Free Body Diagram (FBD) for each object described below. Label each force. Pay attention to the lengths of your vectors. They do not need to be exactly to length (you don't have enough information!), but the relative sizes are important. 2a) A ball, falling downward and colliding with the floor.  Draw an FBD for the time period when the ball is moving downward, but is in contact with the floor and is slowing down.

A buyer purchased a new car from a dealer under a written contract that provided that the price of the car was $20,000 and that the buyer would receive a "trade-in allowance of $7,000 for the buyer's old car." The old car had recently been damaged in an accident. The contract contained a merger clause stating: "This writing constitutes the entire agreement of the parties, and there are no other understandings or agreements not set forth herein." When the buyer took possession of the new car, she delivered the old car to the dealer.

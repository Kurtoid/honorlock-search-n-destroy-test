7. A telephone call center operates from 7am to 6pm (Monday-Friday) and uses hourly planning intervals for its scheduling decisions. The call center uses FT shifts that span a total of eight hours (seven hours of work and a one-hour meal break). The meal breaks in a FT shift can occur after the third hour of work (3 hours of work, a one-hour break, and 4 hours of work), or after the fourth hour of work (4 hours of work, a one-hour break, and 3 hours of work). The call center also uses PT shifts that consist of 4 consecutive hours of work with no break. FT employees are paid $175 per shift and part-time employees are paid $85 per shift. Potential starting times for full-time and part-time shifts are at the beginning of any hour, provided that the shift would not extend past the end of the operating day. No more than three shift starting times can be used for the PT employees and there must be a separation of at least two hours between each of the  selected starting times for the PT employees (note: the solution of the model should indicate what PT starting times to use - don't just pick three). In each hour of the day, the number of FT employees working must be at least as large as the number of PT employees working. You have been asked to develop a linear programming formulation that will select the PT starting times and determine the assignment of FT and PT employees to shifts, so as to minimize cost while satisfying labor requirements in each hour shown in the table below. Be sure to carefully identify your decision variables, objective function and constraints.    7-8am 8-9am 9-10am 10-11am 11-12 12-1pm 1-2pm 2-3pm 3-4pm 4-5pm 5-6pm   12 15 17 18 12 9 11 14 16 17 14

In the video "Successfully Start the Conversation", important elements of this initial approach (first 5 minutes of the meeting) were discussed. So what is missing from the following initial approach... "Good morning, Vincent, thanks for seeing me today. As I mentioned on the phone, my name is Willy Bolander and I am an account manager for Paycom. The owner at Dan's Sandwich Shop, told me about your new show repair business and hopes you will be successful. That is why she suggested we meet today. Since we only have 15 minutes I proposed that the best use of our time is for me to learn more about your business operations and then together we can explore if Paycom can help improve your operations. If we see that it can, then together we can plan a next step. Does that work for you?"

A study on the effects of osteoarthritis on the weight-bearing capacity of knee joints was conducted. The following summary data shows the stance duration (ms) for samples of both older and younger adults. Assume that both stance duration distributions are normal. Age                       n            Sample mean         s Older                  22               780                   97 Younger              18               810                  125   a. Calculate a 90% confidence lower bound for the true stance duration of Younger adults. Lower bound = [LB1] b. Calculate a two-sided 90% confidence interval for the difference between true average stance duration for the older and younger adults. (Use df = 30) Lower bound = [LB] Upper bound= [UB]  c. True or False. It is plausible that there is no difference in the true average stance duration among older individuals and younger individuals. This is [plausible]

Water Quality (BOD) (25 pts): A wastewater treatment plant serving a city of 200,000 people discharges 1.10 m3/sec of treated effluent having an ultimate BOD of 50 mg/L into a stream that has a flow of 8.70 m3/sec and an ultimate BOD of its own equal to 6.0 mg/L. The deoxygenation constant, kd is 0.20/day and the reaeration constant, kr is 0.15/day.   a. ) Assuming complete and instantaneous mixing, estimate the initial ultimate BOD of the river just downstream from the outfall. b.) If the stream has a constant cross section so it flow at a constant speed equal to 0.30 m/s, estimate the BOD remaining in the stream at a distance 30,000 m downstream.

It's Radioactive! (Canvas Q7~11, Handwritten Pages Q7/9) Uranium is a naturally-occurring radioactive element that is most widely known for its use in nuclear reactors to generate carbon-neutral energy. In order to quantitatively determine the concentration of uranium in a sample, a titration can be performed. In this analysis, all of the uranium in a sample is first converted to uranium(IV) cation, then reacted with a titrant. The most common titrant used is potassium permanganate, as it can also serve as an indicator from its vibrant purple color. The balanced equation for the reaction between uranium(IV) and permanganate is shown below. 3 U4+ (aq) + 2 MnO4- (aq) + 2 H2O (l) - 3 UO22+ (aq) + 2 MnO2 (s) + 4 H+ (aq) (Additional 6 points) On your Handwritten Pages, copy over the balanced equation for the reaction between uranium(IV) and permanganate from above. Assign oxidation states for each type of atom in all substances present. Draw in tie-lines where necessary to indicate changes in oxidation number, and clearly label them as representing a loss or a gain of electrons. ( Q7 )  Is this a redox reaction?

A new weight reducing pill is given to 15 people once a week for 3 months to determine its effectiveness in reducing weight.  The following data given in pounds indicate the before and after weights of these people. Use the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test for matched pairs at the 5% level to see if the pill is effective.

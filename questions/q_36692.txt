This is Question D. Please write your solution complete with your full name and Question D at the top. When you have submitted the auto-graded portion of the exam, upload your solution to the Question D assignment in the Exam 2 module within 15 minutes.  Consider the algorithm below, which computes the maximum element of an array A. max(A,n), where n [?] N+ and A = [a0...an-1] is an integer array (1) i - 0 (2) m - a0 (3) while i < n-1 do (4)     if m < ai+1 then m - ai+1 (5)     i - i+1 (6) end (7) return m {output is the maximum value of the array A} (a) (5 points.) Prove that m = max(a0...ai) is a loop invariant. (b) (3 points.) Use the loop invariant m = max(a0...ai) and the loop invariant i <= n-1 to show that max is partially correct. (Note that you do not need to prove that i <= n-1 is a loop invariant.) (c) (2 points.) Find the number of times the if condition in line (4) is tested for an array of length n.

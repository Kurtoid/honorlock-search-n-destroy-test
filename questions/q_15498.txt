A 13.2 g sample of ethanol (C2H5OH) is burned in a bomb calorimeter with a heat capacity of 5.65 kJ/degC.  Using the information below, determine the final temperature of the calorimeter if the initial temperature is 30.0degC.  The molar mass of ethanol is 46.07 g/mol. C2H5OH (l) + 3 O2(g)  -  2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O(g)                   DHdegrxn = -1335 kJ

Using the following to answer questions 37-39. The actual question is that the bottom below the table. The following measurements were made on a person who was exercising: O2 consumed = 4.9 L/minCO2 production = 3.9 L/minAmount urea excreted in urine = 0.02g   - Equations you may need* RQ = (VCO2/VO2)* Non-Protein RQ = (VCO2 -- protein VCO2)/(VO2 -- protein VO2)* Protein VCO2 = 4.8 L CO2 x grams of urea* Protein VO2 = 6 L O2 x grams of urea - Values you may need:* 5.57 g protein metabolized results in 1g of urea nitrogen which produces 4.8 L CO2 and uses 6 L O2.  Question 37: What is the RQ for this person doing this exercise (round to the nearest hundredth)?

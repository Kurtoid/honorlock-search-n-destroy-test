(Continuing from the preceding question.) In a postsynaptic neuron of the parasympathetic nervous system that innervates the SA node, the arrival of action potentials produces [MembranePotentialChange] of the synaptic terminal membrane, which causes causes opening of voltage-gated [SynapticChannels] channels. The ions from these channels bind to proteins that stimulate fusion of [Fusion] with the presynaptic terminal membrane, releasing neurotransmitter onto the SA node. This has three effects on the SA node, all of which [CommonEffect] the time between heart beats: 1) it decreases If,, which [SlopeEffect] the slope of the phase 4 [Phase4Polarity]; 2) it opens [SANodeChannels], which makes the maximum diastolic potential more [MDPPolarity]; and it reduces ICa, which moves the [ICaEffect] to a more positive value.

RECOMMENDED TIME: 60 minutes Due to COVID-19 and the possible spread of variants, the federal government has taken many steps to restrict travel. Recently, the government required inbound air travellers to quarantine, at their expense, in a hotel. Imagine that these steps do not slow down the spread of new variants. In response, the government decides to ban citizens from leaving Canada in an attempt to limit non-essential travel. To achieve this, Parliament passes the following amendment to the federal Quarantine Act: s.58.1 The Governor in Council may make an order prohibiting or subjecting to any condition the exit from Canada of any class of persons if the Governor in Council is of the opinion that it is necessary to prevent the introduction or spread of a disease that would pose an imminent and severe risk to public health in Canada. Following the passage of this amendment, cabinet issues an order prohibiting citizens from leaving Canada unless they first obtain an exemption. Canada Border Service Agency (CBSA) officers, who are "screening officers" under the provisions of the Quarantine Act, have been placed at land and air border crossings leaving Canada and are preventing citizens from leaving. They have also been authorized by cabinet order to issue exemptions, at their discretion, for "essential travel", a term that is not defined in either the Quarantine Act, or the cabinet orders. Neither the Act nor the orders specify any particular procedure to seek an exemption. You work at a law firm that represents a businesswoman who was set to travel to Mexico City for work purposes. She approached a CBSA screening officer at the Toronto Pearson airport and sought an exemption, but was denied. The officer told her, "Come on lady, you're not going to tell me you're really going there for business. You don't look like a business traveller. Women keep trying to make up excuses to go South for vacation!" The screening officer refused to examine the documents that your client tried to provide, which established that she had meetings scheduled at various facilities in Mexico City related to her work. Using the knowledge you have gained from this course, identify and assess the legal issues that arise in this scenario.

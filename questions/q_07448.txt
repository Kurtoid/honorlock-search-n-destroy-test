You are building a pipeline that must go from point A to point C. You are attempting to minimize the cost, and have decided that part of the pipeline will go on land (A to B), and part will go on water (B to C). Suppose the distance from B to D is x{"version":"1.1","math":"x"}. a) In terms of the given values and variables, what is the distance from point A to point B? b) In terms of the given values and variables, what is the distance from point B to point C? c) The cost of pipeline on land is $500/ft, and in the water is $800/ft.

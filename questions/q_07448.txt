What is the action of the Buccinator
You are given two additional pieces of information:  The hint from class we used to discuss the difference in how visible light and x-ray light interacts with matter like the human body.      The fact that two of the most dangerous green house gases, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) have strong light absorption ranges within 4,000 - 20,000 nanometers.     Use the above information to explain, in your own words and in essay format:   How light from the Sun can enter the atmosphere, but the re-emitted light from the Earth cannot escape? Does the green house gas effect require a temperature difference?  We've talked briefly about density, recall that it is defined as mass/volume. Why does atmospheric methane & carbon dioxide density matter in this situation?

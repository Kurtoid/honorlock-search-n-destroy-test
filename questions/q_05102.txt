"It is clear that the main element of any United States policy towards the Soviet Union must be that of a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies...IT is clear that the United States cannot expect in the foreseeable future to enjoy political intimacy with the Soviet regime. It must continue to regard the Soviet Union as a rival, not a partner in the political arena. It must continue to expect that Soviet policies will reflect no abstract love of peace and stability, no real faith in the possibility of a permanent happy coexistence of the Socialist and capitalist worlds, but rather a cautious, persistent pressure towards the disruption and weakening of all rival influence and rival power."

Kennan), State Department professional, "The Sources of Soviet Conduct," Foreign Affairs, July 1947  Which one of the following best reflected the policies advocated in the above excerpt?

A function, Is_it_here, takes in three parameters: (element, list_1, list_2) element: a character-string element, e.g., cat list_1: the name of a list of character-string, e.g., (eagle, tiger, elephant, dog, bear) list_2: the name of a list of character-string, e.g., (tiger, chicken, alligator, pig, beaver) Is_it_here would return 1, if element is in list_1; return 2, if element is in list_2: return 3, if element is in both lists; return 0, if element is not in either lists.  Use functional equivalence partitioning approach to design test cases for this function.  You should have at least three levels of partition.  You must show your partitioning tree. Generate one test case for each leaf node. Note each test case should look like: Case # ((input_data1, input_data2, input_data3), expected output) If a test case is illegal in any sense, state so. Also, list_1 and list_2 should have different contents for different test cases.

What did you think of the zoom job shadow with Olivia Keene, COT?
(3/6) JT was found in his dorm unresponsive with a bottle of Vicodin on the floor.  He was taken to an emergency room, stabilized and admitted to the medical floor for 24-hour observation.  When questioned, he denied suicidal thoughts and continually requested discharge stating: "Everything is fine. I need to go to school in the morning. I have a test." Concerned for his safety, the RN requests a consultation with the Psychiatric Emergency Team (P.E.T.) clinician.  The P.E.T. RN assesses JT and determines that he is in imminent danger of harming himself.  Collateral data shows a recent break-up with his girlfriend and failing grades in school. His appetite is poor and he finds it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. His relationship with his parents is "strained" at best, as they require "perfect behavior and excellent grades." The P.E.T. Team RN places him on a 5150 with a plan to transfer to an inpatient behavioral health facility in the morning. Upon arrival to the behavioral health unit, what should the RN do to ensure the patient is aware of his involuntary admission status?

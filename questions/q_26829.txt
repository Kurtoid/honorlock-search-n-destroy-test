Exam Policies  You are allowed to use Quartus II to write, compile, and test your code for this final exam question. You are not allowed to open files related to past work of any kind during the exam.  You should not be seen viewing code from lecture or a previous lab experiment during the exam. You are not allowed to use any outside resources during the exam.  This includes: internet searches, the textbook (hard or soft copy), prior lab reports, another student's work, another person, notes, lecture material, cell phones/tables/other electronic devices. Within Honorlock, you must allow screen sharing at all times.  If screen sharing is stopped, this will be seen as a violation of academic honesty.  If screen sharing is voluntarily ceased, your exam will be penalized with a loss of points, with a maximum penalty of a final exam score of 0 points.   Problem Statement Write a complete VHDL design description as a two-process or three-process FSM, which implements a synchronous counter that displays each successive digit of the number below. Output to be displayed from FSM:  101933246 You must take into consideration that this number contains repeated digits.   Your FSM must implement a method to keep track of the present/next/previous state(s) of the counter in order to display repeated digits within the provided number. Use the following entity to write your code: entity sync_rand_counter isport(     clr_bar : in std_logic;     clk: in std_logic;     count : out std_logic_vector (3 downto 0));end sync_rand_counter; Exam Submission  Write, compile, and functionally simulate your design in Quartus II. Upload a text file of your code to Canvas.  Code should include a header with your name, course, and date. Upload a screen shot of your functional simulation results to Canvas.

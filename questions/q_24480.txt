Mr. M's physician then ordered a serum and a urine osmolarity and a urine sodium level. He was started on a water restriction regimen and was given a saline IV and saline PEG tube flushes were begun. The serum osmolarity was low, while the urine osmolarity was elevated and the urine sodium was elevated. Questions:  What condition has hypotonic plasma, with lower serum osmolarity and higher urine osmolarity and an elevated urine sodium level with a lower plasma sodium level?

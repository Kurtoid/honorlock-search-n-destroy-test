Continuation from Question 39.  Your current 3-D printing process step has 4 printers.  Production Control is now telling you the daily demand for printed components is 3,360 each day.  You are staffing the printers 24 hours each day.  Assuming each printer can produce 28 components each hour, how many additional printers do you need to install to meet this daily demand?  Choose the closest answer.

PART II - BONUS QUESTIONS  The following is a bonus question. (Points WILL NOT be deducted, even if you answer the question incorrectly.) Read the following news article and answer the questions at the end.     Where are memories stored in the brain? The hippocampus, located in the brain's temporal lobe, is where episodic memories are formed and indexed for later access. Episodic memories are autobiographical memories from specific events in our lives, like the coffee we had with a friend last week. How do we know this? In 1953, a patient named Henry Molaison had his hippocampus surgically removed during an operation in the United States to treat his epilepsy. His epilepsy was cured, and Molaison lived a further 55 healthy years. However, after the surgery he was only able to form episodic memories that lasted a matter of minutes; he was completely unable to permanently store new information. As a result, Molaison's memory became mostly limited to events that occurred years before his surgery, in the distant past. He was, however, still able to improve his performance on various motor tasks, even though he had no memory of ever encountering or practising them. This indicated that although the hippocampus is crucial for laying down memories, it is not the site of permanent memory storage and isn't needed for motor memories.  The study of Henry Molaison was revolutionary because it showed that multiple types of memory existed. We now know that rather than relying on the hippocampus, implicit motor learning occurs in other brain areas. Neocortex The neocortex is the largest part of the cerebral cortex, the sheet of neural tissue that forms the outside surface of the brain, distinctive in higher mammals for its wrinkly appearance. In humans, the neocortex is involved in higher functions such as sensory perception, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning and language. Over time, information from certain memories that are temporarily stored in the hippocampus can be transferred to the neocortex as general knowledge - things like knowing that coffee provides a pick-me-up. Researchers think this transfer from hippocampus to neocortex happens as we sleep.       A person suffering from a closed head injury remembers events from this week very clearly, but cannot recognize the faces of people she knew before the injury occurred.  Which part of her brain is most likely affected by the injury?

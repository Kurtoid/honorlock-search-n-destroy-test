Zoe Hunter is a twenty-four old woman who is in her last year of graduate studies.  Ever since she began school four years ago, she noticed that she has become more and more agitated about seemingly endless lists of things.  Zoe spends most of her day worrying whether she will do well enough in her courses to maintain her student loans.

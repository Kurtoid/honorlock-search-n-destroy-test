Steam in a piston-cylinder assembly expands from p1 = 35 bars to p2  = 7 bars.  The +pressure-volume relation during the process is pV2 = constant.  The mass of steam is 2.3 kg.  Other steam properties at the initial state are u1 = 3282.1 kJ/kg and v1 = 113.24 cm3/g.  At the final state u2 = 2124.6 kJ/kg.  Neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energy, calculate the heat transfer, in kJ, for the steam in the system.

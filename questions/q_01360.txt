For your final examination, you should write a cohesive, well-developed essay that fully addresses the essay prompt. Please closely read the following CQ Researcher articles (published April 10, 2015 (volume 25, issue 14)) and then the prompt below.     "Teaching Critical Thinking-Does Common Core Help Students Learn Critical Thinking: Pro"by Karen Vogelsang, 2014-15 Tennessee Teacher of the Year   "Teaching Critical Thinking-Does Common Core Help Students Learn Critical Thinking: Con"by Paul Thomas, Associate Professor of English Education at Furman University     par. 1Martin Luther King Jr. once said, "The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically." For our students to be prepared for the workforce of the future, the ability to solve problems and think critically is imperative. par. 2The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) consist of rigorous academic standards in reading and math that students have to master at each grade level. In fourth grade, a Common Core reading standard requires students to integrate information from two texts in order to write or speak knowledgeably about a topic. In mathematics, fourth-grade students are expected to solve multistep word problems using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. par. 3Business leaders want employees who can do more than plug numbers into an algorithm. Critical thinking and problem-solving are vital skills for a rapidly changing workforce. Common Core can help students develop the critical-thinking, problem-solving and analytical skills needed for success. par. 4Before the adoption of CCSS, my instruction was based on an extensive list of narrow performance indicators. In English language arts, for example, students identified sentence types by recognizing appropriate end punctuation marks. In math, students identified the place value of a specified digit. These indicators simply required students to recall information. Students didn't develop a true understanding of the overarching concepts each indicator was related to. I was the sage on the stage, and instruction revolved around me! par. 5Today, my classroom is student-centered, and I'm using CCSS to guide my instruction, which is focused on developing students' abilities to read critically and enabling them to compare those two texts. They are listening, sharing and synthesizing information to aid in the development of critical-thinking skills so they can speak knowledgeably. In math, they are learning multiple pathways for problem-solving using the four arithmetic operations, and they are justifying and explaining their answers. These are life skills, not just an algorithm or a list of rules or facts to memorize and forget. They are deeply engaged in their work and understanding new content in ways that develop these integral skills. par. 6Regardless of which path a student chooses, educators across the country now have a common language with Common Core, and we can use these standards to develop critical-thinking, problem-solving and analytical skills--life skills that students need to be successful in whatever path they choose.   par. 1Proponents of Common Core and national standardized tests often claim it is the first and most demanding effort of its kind. However, the Common Core movement sits in a long line of standards initiatives reaching back to the Committee of 10 in the 1890s, formed to create more challenging high school courses to prepare students for college. Charles Eliot, then-president of Harvard, chaired that panel of college presidents, professors and public and private school leaders. par. 2The past 30 years of state-based accountability, based on several versions of standards and high-stakes tests--each claiming higher expectations than the last--reveal that standards linked to such tests often ask less of students, not more. In fact, no clear correlation exists between the quality or presence of standards and measurable student outcomes such as test scores. Some states with so-called high standards have low scores, while some states with weak standards have high scores. par. 3Accountability and standards intended to drive higher expectations of students--expectations labeled today as "critical thinking" or "higher-order thinking skills"--always come down to this: What is tested is what is taught. Because all states implementing Common Core have also adopted high-stakes testing, students will not be asked to think critically. They will be prepared to take tests. par. 4In the context of standardized testing, higher-order thinking skills are not critical but are discrete skills that lend themselves to efficient teaching and testing formats. True critical thinking involves investigating a text--moving beyond decoding and comprehension to challenging claims and agendas and examining historical influences. Thus, it is difficult to test in multiple-choice formats. par. 5The Common Core English/Language Arts (ELA) standards, for example, reduce critical thinking to "close reading," a rebranding of traditional approaches that require students to remain focused on the text only. It is what many of us did in English classes when we analyzed poems for technical elements such as rhyme and meter or figurative language. par. 6But true critical reading and thinking cannot be bound to the text only. The writer's biography, the text's historical setting and its impact on readers all bear on the larger questions of power: Who is making the claims in this text and why? Ironically, a critical reading of Common Core standards exposes a commitment to more of the same failed approach that masks yet more test prep as critical thinking.     _____________________________________________________________________________________ Topic: Using the above-noted articles, "Teaching Critical Thinking-Does Common Core Help Students Learn Critical Thinking: Pro" and "Teaching Critical Thinking-Does Common Core Help Students Learn Critical Thinking: Con," as reference sources, write an essay in which you analyze each author's use of one rhetorical tool or rhetorical appeal to achieve his or her specific purpose.  To start, determine what you believe is each author's specific purpose. Choose one of the following specific purposes for each author: to convince, to justify, to validate, to condemn, to expose, to incite, to celebrate, to defend, or to question. Then, determine which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Pro" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose and then which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Con" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose. You must choose both tools and/or appeals from the following list:    alliteration amplification allusions analogy arrangement/organization authorities/outside sources definitions diction (and/or loaded diction) enthymeme examples facts irony paradox parallelism refutation rhetorical questions statistics testimony tone logos pathos ethos kairos     Organize your ideas into a four-paragraph essay that includes the following paragraphs: (paragraph 1) an introduction paragraph; (paragraphs 2 and 3) two separate, well-developed rhetorical tools and/or rhetorical appeals body paragraphs (one focused on the "Pro" author's use of your chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose and the other focused on the "Con" author's use of your other chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose); and (paragraph 4) a conclusion paragraph. Your essay must include a forecasting thesis statement and effective topic and concluding sentences in each body paragraph. At least four times in your essay, you also must correctly integrate quotations, paraphrases, and/or summaries from the above-noted articles; remember to include proper in-text citations.

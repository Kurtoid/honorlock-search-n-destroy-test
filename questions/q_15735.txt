Question: How many grams of sulfur dioxide are produced by the reaction of 385 mL of 0.109 M Sr(HSO3)2 solution with excess boric acid?  Here is the balanced chemical equation: 2 H3BO3 (aq)  +  3 Sr(HSO3)2 (aq)  -->   Sr3(BO3)2 (s)  +  6 SO2 (g)  +  6 H2O (l) Molar mass for all substances: H3BO3 = 61.84 g/mol   |   Sr(HSO3)2 = 249.76 g/mol   Sr3(BO3)2 = 380.48 g/mol   |   SO2 = 64.06 g/mol  |  H2O = 18.02 g/mol

But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city's white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative. In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self purification; and direct action. We have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice engulfs this community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation. These are the hard, brutal facts of the case. On the basis of these conditions, Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the latter consistently refused to engage in good faith negotiation. Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham's economic community. In the course of the negotiations, certain promises were made by the merchants -- for example, to remove the stores' humiliating racial signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs, briefly removed, returned; the others remained.

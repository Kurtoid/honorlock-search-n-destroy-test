Consider the concentric spherical conductors arranged as shown in the figure below. Each of the dimensions for the conductors are given in terms of the length a. Assume the cavity between the conductors is initially a vacuum. Clearly justify all of your answers to the following questions.    a) Calculate the capacitance for the arrangement of conductors shown in the figure. Your answer should be written in terms of a number and a. b) For the rest of this problem use a = 0.0022 m. Calculate the capacitance of the spherical conductors for a = 0.0022 m. c) A 28 V battery is connected between the inner and outer conductors. How much charge develops on each of the conductor surfaces? While the battery is connected to the capacitor, the vacuum seal starts to leak filling the cavity with a gas that increases the permittivity to 2.08x10-10 C2/Nm2.  Answer the following questions concerning the effect of the dielectric. d) How much energy is stored by the capacitor with a dielectric? e) What is the new charge on the conductors? f) Now the battery is disconnected from the capacitor. If the dielectric gas is removed from in between the conductors, then calculate how much energy is now stored by the capacitor? part a) 3. A charge +Q is put on the inner conductor, and -Q is put on the outer conductor. Calculate the electric field between the inner and outer conductor in terms of the radial distance from the centers of the conductors. Your answer will be a number times   ; just enter the coefficient of the number in scientific notation , neglecting units. Round to 3 decimal places. E =    ?     x109
Use this information to answer the following two questions. Brown-headed cowbirds are brood parasites: the females lay their eggs in the nests of other species, and then their babies are fed by their host parents. Female cowbirds will find and monitor multiple nests of other species over a period of weeks, visiting repeatedly until the host nest is at the right stage for the cowbird to lay her eggs.  Male cowbirds do not participate in this egg-laying behavior at all.  Grackles are a close relative of the cowbird, but have a more typical mating system - the female lays her eggs in her own nest, and both the male and the female visit the nest to incubate the eggs and feed the offspring.

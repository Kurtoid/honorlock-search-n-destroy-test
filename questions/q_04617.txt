Four electricians submitted bids to the contractor in the following amounts:$65,000, $80,000, $95,000, and $100,000. After compiling all of the bids from the electricians and calculating her costs based on the lowest bids, the contractor submitted her general bid to the county. The county accepted this bid. After the acceptance, the electrician who had submitted the lowest bid realized he had made a mistake in his calculations. His bid should have been $100,000. The electrician immediately notified the contractor of his mistake and stated that he was revoking his bid.

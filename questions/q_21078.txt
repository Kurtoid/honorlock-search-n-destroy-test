Question 3 (40 pts)   For the MOSFET circuit below, assume kn'=mnCox=100mA/V2, , threshold voltage Vth = 1V, and l=0 (no channel length modulation). Find V1, V2, IM (the current flowing in the MOSFET) and I (the current in the 1kW resistor).
4. Consider a two-echelon supply chain consisting of three possible plants, two distribution centers, and three warehouses. Two of the three plants (P1, P2, P3) will ship units to the distribution centers (DC1, DC2), which will subsequently supply the warehouses (W1, W2, W3). The plant shipment capacities are 1800, 1500, and 1600 units for P1, P2, and P3, respectively. The distribution centers DC1 and DC2 have shipment capacity limits of 1650 and 1550, respectively. Demand levels at warehouses W1, W2, and W3  are 1000, 900, and 1100 units, respectively. Currently, there are 40 units stored at DC1 and 55 units stored at DC2. Management would like a distribution plan that leaves 30 units at both DCs after demand at each warehouse is satisfied. The variable costs of shipping are shown below. Formulate a single integer linear programming model that, when solved, will determine which two of the three plants to open and will provide a distribution plan that meets all constraints and minimizes total variable distribution costs. [Do not solve the problem. Just provide the formulation without any attempt to reduce complexity by solving (or partially solving) the problem.]     DC1 DC2   W1 W2 W3   P1 7 5  DC1 4 5 7   P2 6 7  DC2 5 6 5   P3 4 7

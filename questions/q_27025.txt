The following description applies to this problem and the next one. Two cubic meters of air at 300 kPa and 100 oC is inside a tank as shown in the figure. The air is allowed to escape through the valve to the outside until its pressure inside the tank reaches 200 kPa and its temperature 50 oC.  Some properties of air are: R = 0.287 kJ/kg.K, Cp = 1.005 kJ/kg.K, Cv = 0.718 kJ/kg.K  The initial mas of air in kg inside the tank is closer to:

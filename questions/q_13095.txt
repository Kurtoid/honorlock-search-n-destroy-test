Officer, a Florida Highway Patrol officer, observes Suspect's vehicle traveling much faster than vehicles around Suspect's vehicle. Officer uses his radar equipment that was calibrated earlier that day and determines that Suspect is traveling 90 miles per hour in an area where the posted speed limit is 35 miles per hour. Based upon his observations and the results of the radar reading, Officer initiates a traffic stop. Suspect immediately stops. As Officer approaches Suspect's vehicle, Suspect states, "I burned a house a year ago, but I'm saving money to pay for it." Officer then requests Suspect's driver's license, and a license check reveals an outstanding arrest warrant issued a year ago for Suspect for the crime of arson. Officer places Suspect in handcuffs, advises Suspect that Suspect is under arrest, and places Suspect in the back of Officer's vehicle. Officer then searches Suspect's vehicle. In a closed glove compartment, Officer locates a plastic bag containing cocaine. Officer returns and tells Suspect, "I am now conducting a criminal investigation. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you in court. You also have the right to an attorney, and I will call your attorney if you want to talk before I question you." Suspect asks, "What good can an attorney do?" Officer responds, "None. An attorney will tell you to be quiet, and honesty is the best policy." Suspect says he does not want an attorney and, in response to Officer's questioning, provides a full confession to both the arson and possession of cocaine. Officer then contacts Suspect's aunt and informs her of the arrest and coordinates her pick up of Suspect's vehicle.

Two infinitely long, cylindrical conducting shells are concentrically arranged as shown above. The inner shell has a radius R1 and the outer shell the radius R2. The inner shell has a charge per unit area s1, and the outer shell a charge per unit area s2.  a) Find the electric field at all points in space (you should have three answers for three distinct regions).  b) Find the surface charge density s2 (in terms of s1,R1,R2, etc.) that causes the field to vanish everywhere but in between the two shells. Justify your answer with Gauss's law.         Gauss's Law:

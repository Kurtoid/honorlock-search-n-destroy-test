A coffee cup calorimeter is used to determine the specific heat capacity of Al.  A 25.6457 g sample of Al is heated to 85.0deg{"version":"1.1","math":"deg"}C and then added to 50.0 mL of water at 26.5deg{"version":"1.1","math":"deg"}C in the calorimeter. The final temperature of the water and the Al was 28.0deg{"version":"1.1","math":"deg"}C.  What is the specific heat capacity of the Al?  (the heat capacity of the calorimeter is 26 J/deg{"version":"1.1","math":"deg"}C,  density of water is 1.00 g/mL and specific heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/gdeg{"version":"1.1","math":"deg"}C)

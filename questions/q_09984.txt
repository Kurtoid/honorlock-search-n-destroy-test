QUESTION 3 - 6 Points Embiid Construction, LLC engaged in lengthy negotiations for the purchase of an office building from Simmons Properties, Inc. (the owner of the building).  On March 1, Embiid submitted a signed written offer to purchase the building for $2,500,000 and it was received by Simmons on that same day.  It provided that the offer would not be withdrawn at any time prior to March 30 and that any acceptance had to be received on or before that date or no contract would be formed.  On March 15, Embiid sent a signed letter to Simmons which provided as follows: "we found a better deal on a building and therefore you can ignore our March 1 offer."  This communication was received by Simmons on March 18.  On March 19 Simmons sent by email and mail to Embiid a signed acceptance of the March 1 offer and Embiid received the email shortly after it was sent.  As you might expect there is now a disagreement as to whether the parties have a contract - Simmons contends that it properly accepted the Embiid offer and therefore a contract was formed.  Embiid argues that Simmons's March 19 email/letter was too late.   Required - 6 Points.  Who is correct, Simmons or Embiid?  Discuss.

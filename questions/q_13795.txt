Regression is often used in health research to help determine the social and economic indicators that lead to certain health problems.  You wish to understand some of the factors that lead to Cirrhosis of the liver.  You have a dataset, where each item is a US state.  The variables are as follows: Independent Variables SizeUrban: the size of the urban population, Birth45to49: the number of births to women between 45 to 49 (actually, the reciprocal of that value, times 100) ConsWine: the consumption of wine per capita, ConsLiquor: the consumption of hard liquor per capita, Dependent Variable Cirrhosis: the death rate from cirrhosis. You run the regression and get the following results: > lm.Cirr summary(lm.Cirr)  a) What proportion of variation in the data is accounted for by the regression? Will the regression model give good predictive power? Why? b) In the health field, it is always good to be sure of good statistical significance, so you choose a Type I error of a=0.01. At this level of error, is the overall regression significant? Why (give evidence using p-value)?  Which independent variables are significant at a=0.01? c) The model is built using data from 46 states. A few states were missed out, including Mississippi. Mississippi has the following data.     SizeUrban   Birth45to49   ConsWine   ConsLiquor      31   34.2   6   35      Use this data and the coefficient output from the regression model to predict the value of cirrhosis for Mississippi. (just a point estimate of

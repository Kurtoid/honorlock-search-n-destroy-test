Complete your choice of one of the proofs given below. PROOF 1:  Prove the following statement using a proof by cases.   [Hint: there are 3 cases] "For all positive integers n with 2 <= n <= 4, n!/2 <= n2+1."  Use good proof technique.   Grading rubric:1 pt. State any givens and assumptions.3 pt. Clearly identify the cases and prove each case.1 pt. State the final conclusion at the end of the proof. Note:  Remember that n factorial, written as n!, is defined as n(n-1)...(2)1, the product of n times every positive integer less than n.   To avoid the need for typing superscript exponents, you may use the expression '2^n' to represent 2n.  Also the <= symbol can be written as

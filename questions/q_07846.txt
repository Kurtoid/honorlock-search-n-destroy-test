A climber of mass 72 kg is dangling over the edge of an ice cliff. He is roped to a 800 kg car located at a distance x from the edge of the cliff. Unfortunately, the car starts slipping (the car is on ice) and the climber accelerates downwards! Neglect the mass of the rope. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the tires of the car and the ice is 0.07.  Make a free body diagram for the car and for the climber (2pts) What is the climber's acceleration? (4 pts) What is the tension in the rope? (4 pts)

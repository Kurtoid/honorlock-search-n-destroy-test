Continuing the experiments in the previous question, a knockout mouse line lacking the receptor for C3 fragments is generated to elucidate the function of complement C3 in the humoral immune response.  This receptor is encoded by the Cr2 gene, so knockout mice lacking this gene are known as Cr2-/-.  Previous studies have indicated that the complement receptor encoded by the Cr2 gene is expressed on B cells and on the follicular dendritic cells (FDC) that reside in the germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs.  FDCs are stromal cells that are not bone marrow-derived. To distinguish the functions of the complement receptor on these two cell types, a series of bone marrow chimeras are generated.  Wild-type bone marrow is used to reconstitute lethally irradiated Cr2-/- mice (wt (r) Cr2-/-), or vice versa (Cr2-/- (r) wt).  As controls, Cr2-/- bone marrow is used to reconstitute Cr2-/- recipients (Cr2-/- (r) Cr2-/-), and wild-type bone marrow used to reconstitute wild-type recipients (wt (r) wt).  These mice are then inoculated with the HSV-rd virus at 106 PFU, once at day 0 and then a second time at day 28, and the anti-HSV IgG responses are measured every 7 days, as shown in Figure 1B.    Complete the table below by using the drop-down menus to indicate the Cr2 allele is WT or -/- for the B cells and FDCs in each of the four groups of mice in this experiment.

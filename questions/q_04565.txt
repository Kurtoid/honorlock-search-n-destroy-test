Some of the questions on this exam require you to show your work. You will not receive credit for a correct answer unless you also type your solution in the answer box. The exam length considers this requirement.  Example: Suppose you are given F = $10, i% = 5% per year, N = 2 years, and you need to find the Present value. Sample answer formats include: Factor notation  P = 10 (P/F, 5%, 2) = 10 (0.9070) = 9.07  Calculator TVM function  N = 2, I% = 5%, FV = 10, PV = -9.07  Formula  P = 10 (1 + 0.05)^(-2) = 9.07, or P = 10 (1 + 0.05)-2 = 9.07, or You may also use the Math Equation editor

Consider the test score example we covered in class, where we regressed test scores against the student-teacher ratio. Assuming D is a dummy variable, such that D = 1 if the student-teacher ratio is < 20, and D = 0 if the student-teacher ratio is >= 20. The estimated regression equation for (n = 420) is:  TestScore (estimated) =   650 +   7.4  D                                          (1.3)     (1.8)       R2 = 0.0.037   What is the average test score for the subsample with student-teacher ratios less than 20?    650 6 4 8

Report the total expected NPV of the Flexible Lease Option.   Here are the problem settings and the developed decision tree:  1,000 sq. ft. of warehouse space needed for 1,000 units of demand Current demand = 100,000 units per year  Binomial uncertainty in the next 2 years: Demand can go up by 20% with p = 0.5 or down by 20% with 1 - p = 0.5 each year   Lease price = $1.00 per sq. ft. per year Spot market price = $1.20 per sq. ft. per year  Binomial uncertainty in the next 2 years: Spot prices can go up by 10% with p = 0.5 or down by 10% with 1 - p = 0.5 each year   Revenue = $1.22 per unit of demand k = 0.1 For the Flexible Lease Option:  Trips Logistics needs to rent at least lease 60,000 sq. ft. of warehouse space at $1/sq. ft. per year.

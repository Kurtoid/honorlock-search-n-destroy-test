You want to surprise your family by staying in an old Scottish castle during your visit and are negotiating over the rental of a castle. The castle's owner wishes to preserve his real income against both inflation and exchange rate changes, and so the present weekly rent of PS2,950 (summer season) will be adjusted upwards or downwards for any change in the U.K. cost of living between now and then. You are basing your budgeting on purchasing power parity (PPP).  The U.K. inflation rate is expected to average 1.75% for the coming year, while U.S. inflation is expected to be 3.25%. The current spot rate is $1.3947/PS.  What would be the exchange rate in one year if PPP held? What should you budget as the U.S. dollar cost of the one-week rental? If the actual exchange rate in one year is $1.3758/PS, is the U.S. dollar overvalued or undervalued according to purchasing power parity?

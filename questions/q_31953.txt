QUESTION 2         The diagram shows a coin being dropped from a height and the graph shows how the velocity of the coin changes until it hits the ground.    Right click on the button to open the diagram and graph of the coin being dropped in a new window.         2.1   The coin hits the ground in a time of 0.62 s with a velocity of 6.1 m/s.  Calculate the acceleration of the coin as it falls. Give the unit.    (3)     2.2   State the feature of the graph that shows this acceleration.    (1)     2.3   Calculate the height from which the coin was dropped.  Use the graph to help with your calculation.    (3)     2.4   The coin is now dropped from the 20th floor of a skyscraper. The graph shows how the velocity of the coin changes until just before it hits the ground.    Right click on the button to open the graph in a new window.     (5)

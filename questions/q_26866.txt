Gator Hospitality is a leader in the travel industry (market capitalization of $25 billion) with a unique portfolio of hotel properties that cater exclusively to university mascots traveling for business.  Gator owns and operates three luxury hotels in Gainesville, Florida: a five-room unit in the Stephen O'Connell Center (for in-door mascots), a seven-room unit in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium (for out-door mascots), and a two-room unit hidden inside Broward Pool (for aquatic mascots). Just last month, Albert and Alberta showed up to ACG 5815 Headquarters and asked for the professional accounting services of the Florida Gators for its December 31, 2020 fiscal year-end (assume interest rates were 15% throughout 2020).  First, Alberta wanted to know how to account for the towels at its Broward Pool location.  Instead of just buying a bunch of towels, Gator signed a five-year contract on January 1, 2020 with a third party, Absorbent Fabric Inc. ("Absorbent Fabric"), to provide the towels for guests at Broward for a total of $50,000 (equal payments are due each year January 1st).  These towels are so nice and important to Gator's guests that Gator included an additional $10,000 signing bonus (due January 1, 2020) to secure its contract with Absorbent Fabric and ensure Gator has the option to extend the contract for an additional five years (after the extension though, the contract is finished - Absorbent Fabric wants to have the option to provide the towels to another customer because they are in very high demand).  Absorbent Fabric has 50 custom designed hand-stitched towels with the UF logo and uses a portable machine to wash and dry the towels (the towels cost Absorbent Fabric $20,000 each and they have an estimated useful life of 100 years).  In the contract, Absorbent Fabric must make available two towels to any Gator guest at any time of the day during each year of the five-year contract.  Additionally, Absorbent Fabric's entire inventory of custom UF towels must stay at the Broward location at all times to ensure there is ample supply in the event of a pool party. Second, Albert wanted to know how Absorbent Fabric should account for the towel contract.  Albert's best friend, Lyle-Lyle, is a controller for Absorbent Fabric and Lyle-Lyle has been struggling to figure out how to account for the contract.  Lyle-Lyle is extra worried because Absorbent Fabric is an SEC registrant (market capitalization of $1 billion; December 31, 2020 year-end), so a lot of people are counting on him.  Albert said he would get Lyle-Lyle some help. Third, Albert found out that the word "alligator" translated in French is "alligator" and wanted to know if it was the same way with accounting.  Specifically, he was interested to know whether the accounting for towels at Gator's Broward Pool location is the same for GAAP and IFRS.  Albert is curious about (1) what IFRS standard would be relevant and (2) when that standard was last updated [he is just curious at an extremely high level though - for example IAS 41 Agriculture and the date of the last update would be an acceptable answer to satisfy Albert's curiosity if he was interested in how to account for chickens (this question was not intended to take a lot of time to answer)]. Finally, Alberta wants to know how to account for the tennis balls it provides guests of its Ben Hill Griffin Stadium location (this is a big draw for all the dog and cat mascots in the Southeastern Conference).  Instead of just buying a bunch of tennis balls, Gator signed a ten-year contract on January 1, 2020 with a third party, Go Fetch Co. ("Go Fetch"), to provide the tennis balls for a total of $5,000 (equal payments are due each year January 1st).  Go Fetch provides 100 green Wilson tennis balls each morning to Go Fetch's three customers (300 total tennis balls delivered daily): Gator Hospitality, the UF Tennis Team, and the Gainesville Country Club (the tennis balls cost Go Fetch $1,000 each and they have an estimated useful life of 100 years).  Each afternoon, Go Fetch collects all the tennis balls from each location, washes them all in one big washing machine, and then randomly sorts them into three containers for the next day's delivery (this is absolutely the most cost-effective way for Go Fetch to clean tennis balls on a daily basis - it saves them millions of dollars).  Gator's guests complain about Go Fetch because an employee of Go Fetch is stationed at the Stadium all day and tells everyone how the tennis balls can and cannot be used according to the contract (e.g. no chewing).  Required  Pretend that it is 12/31/2020 at 11:59PM EST. Answer each of Gator Hospitality's accounting questions and provide citations from the authoritative literature supporting your conclusions - each citation counts, so be thorough (citations must be relevant though - no citation "spamming"). Answers should include consideration of (1) recognition, (2) initial measurement, and (3) subsequent measurement. For each asset identified in the case [and this only pertains to assets in the case (if there are any)], explain why the asset satisfies the definition of an asset (based on the ACG 5815 Conceptual Framework definition of an asset). Discuss the accounting in relation to both the balance sheet and income statement. Make sure to read each question carefully and thoroughly search the applicable authoritative literature.

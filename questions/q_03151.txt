OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT For the following hypothetical credit approval/credit card process, there are 4 tasks as shown in the process diagram below: Details of staffing levels and productivity levels for each step is as follows:  TASK 1: 6 operators currently assigned; 4 more available if required; processing capability of 40 customers/hour/operator; and maximum overtime of 4 hours/operator/day available if required. TASK 2A: maximum processing capacity of 750 customers per hour. External input and thus capability is fixed. TASK 2B: 3 analysts currently assigned; 3 more available if required; and each analyst can process 100 customers per hour (analysts will only work 40 hours a week).  TASK 3: 2 operators currently assigned; 1 more available if required; processing capability of 120 customers per operator per hour; and maximum overtime of 4 hours/operator/day available if required.    It is safe to assume that regular time available per week per operator is 40 hours.  Based on this information, you are required to answer the questions below:

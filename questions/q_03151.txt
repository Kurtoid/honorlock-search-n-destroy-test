A nurse educator is teaching a class to a group of nurses on Vancomycin administration. Which information should be included in her lecture? Select all that apply.  Correct Answer: all are correct except that it turns stool red. Vancomycin (Vancocin) is an antibiotic usually reserved for severe infections from gram-positive organisms such as S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is often used after bacteria have become resistant to other, safer antibiotics. Vancomycin is the most effective drug for treating MRSA infections. Because of the drug's ototoxicity, hearing must be evaluated frequently throughout the course of therapy. Vancomycin can also cause nephrotoxicity, leading to uremia. Peak and trough levels are drawn after three doses have been administered. A reaction that can occur with rapid IV administration is known as red man syndrome and results as large amounts of histamine are released in the body. Symptoms include hypotension with flushing and a red rash, most often of the face, neck, trunk, or upper body.

Essay: Choose ONE of the following for your essay: Thoughtful and thorough essays, well-supported by specific details in the story, receive the strongest scores. Essay: Choose ONE of the following for your essay: Option One: Discuss how one character's life significantly affects two-three other characters in one of the plays we read this semester. (1) Analyze the character you chose, fully explaining his or her nature and complexity based on specific references to his or her actions and dialogue. (2) Then, using specific scenes as examples, describe the significance of that person's influence in the identity and/or development of two-three other characters. Draw the essay to a meaningful conclusion. Option Two (This was the same essay used for the short fiction exam but works for drama as well because you are writing about a different story.): Based on your reading of one of the plays we read this semester, as well as our discussion in class, describe the development of one character. First, describe that character at the beginning of the play. Then discuss and trace that character's development using specific details from the play. Next, explain how we know that character altered or deepened by the ending of the play and the reasons for this development. The essay should be more than a list of the character's actions. It should also discuss the inner development of the character and how his or her actions show the inner tensions/emotions/reasoning of that character. End with a meaningful discussion of how this character's actions may affect readers or society. Feel free to use biblical support if the meaning aligns with a situation/character/truth in Scripture. Option Three: Evidence of humanity's fallenness is evident in all three plays you read for this unit. Twila Brown Edwards, former theology and literature professor, argues that in order for literature to be true, it must represent the fallenness of humanity. She says "[It is] the literary artist's responsibility to truthfully name the fallenness of humankind. Although reading about grossly fallen individuals can be uncomfortable to Christians, understanding the Fall, is, nevertheless, also a part of the truth of human nature. Truth is not always beautiful. If we are faithful to our call to know the truth, we cannot avoid the horrifying ugliness of the Fall. We read such literature, therefore, to help us understand the truth of sin's power. We are called to know God's truth--all of it, even the part that is ugly and fallen." Write an essay that (1) specifically discusses the complexity of sin or fallenness in ONE of the three plays we read this semester and whether there is hope of redemption from it and (2) how reading about the fallen situations can be a meaningful experience that may help readers manage their own fallenness. Use specific support from the play in your answer. Option Four: Specifically describe two scenes from TWO plays we read this semester that connect in some way and discuss what these scenes distinctly reveal about the human condition, with consideration of conflict, character, and possibly culture. Why are these scenes especially significant in the stories, how might they compare or contrast, and what effect they may have on the audience?

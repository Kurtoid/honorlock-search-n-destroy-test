I understand that I may discuss lab assignments with other students in the course but that my lab data should be my own. All lab assignments will be completed using online simulations and thus a lab partner is not necessary. I understand that if I do work with another student on a lab assignment, I must write their name on the lab data sheet and also must okay this collaboration with my instructor prior to completing the lab. I also understand that all questions and calculations on the lab must be my own work even if I have worked with a partner on collecting data. I agree to not provide copies of my lab assignments (hard copies nor electronic copies) to others both at the present time or at anytime in the future.

(12 pts..) A projectile of mass Mp is fired from the ground at an angle of ph and a speed of V0. When it is at the top if its trajectory, at an altitude of h, it impacts and embedds itself into a stationary wooden block of mass MB . The combined object has an initial horizontal speed V'. As the combined objects falls to the ground, air resistance does an amount of work, Wf , equal to -(the work done by gravity as the object falls to the ground). What is the speed of the object when it hits the ground? Hint: Use W = -DU to calculatee the work done by gravity. Make a drawing and show where U = 0.

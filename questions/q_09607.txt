Monopoly Suppose that Comcast owns the only cable going into every home in a small town, so it is the only company that can sell Internet. The more Internet it wants to sell, the less it can charge its customers. The (monthly) demand for Internet is given by the equation WTP = $100 - $10Q. Meanwhile, Comcast's costs are described the equation TC = $20 + $2Q, because it costs $20 to connect the town to the rest of the web and $2 to provide technical support for each home. Comcast's costs are shown below as well as its Total Revenue and Marginal Revenue, assuming it charges all customers the same rate. [Note: You can solve this problem using the table below or using the equations above. It's probably easier to use the table. Either way, assume the Comcast cannot sell Internet to a fraction of a home, so the equilibrium quantity is an integer.]   (4 pts.) Using what you know about Comcast's costs and the demand for Internet, what price will it charge for Internet? Why? How many consumers will purchase it at that price? (4 pts.) Calculate the firm's total profit for each quantity of output for the table above. Is this consistent with your answer in (a)? (You only need to create a table with two columns. One column that shows the quantity and the other that gives the profit at that quantity.) (4 pts.) What is the profit and consumer surplus at the equilibrium in (a)? (4 pts.) Is the equilibrium price and quantity you found in (a) efficient? Why or why not? (4 pts.) What price for Internet would maximize the total surplus? Why?

Wiley Coyote has missed the elusive Roadrunner once again.    The coyote leaves the edge of the cliff at 50 m/s horizontal velocity. If the canyon is 314 m deep, how far from the edge of the cliff does the coyote land? (neglect any air resistance) Wiley Coyote lands on a small model rocket initially at rest. The rocket is fired vertically with an upward acceleration of 10 m/s2.  At an altitude of 0.50 km, the engine of the rocket burns out.  What is the maximum altitude above the canyon floor Wiley Coyote achieves? Wiley Coyote pulls out a helium balloon from his pocket, thus keeping him at a constant height above the canyon floor. The density of helium is one-seventh that of air, and the density of air is 1/800 that of water.  Consider the mass of the balloon to be negligible.  The volume of the balloon is 100 m3.  How much does Wiley Coyote weigh (in N)? He drifts to 209 m above the canyon floor. As his luck would have it, a passing bird pops the balloon.  What speed does Wiley Coyote hit the canyon floor again?

In Homework 3 we calculated the amount of energy released by one fusion reaction of the triple alpha process. This process fuses together 3 helium atoms into 1 carbon atom. And it releases energy in the process.  We also calculated how many reactions/second this was based upon the total luminosity of one of these stars.   Why is this last calculation wrong? Does a red giant (like the Sun in its later life) derive all of its energy from fusing three helium into a single carbon? Or does it supplement this energy with a different fusion reaction?   This is an essay question. Explain your answer and reasoning in extraordinary detail. One to two sentence answers will not earn you points, even if correct.

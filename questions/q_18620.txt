A swine breeder is selecting for faster growing pigs to 230 lb (D230) and reduced backfat (BF) in her pigs. She plans to choose three of the following eight boars based on EBV's for these traits.     Boar #   EBV for D230   EBV for Backfat,     1   +1.0   +.05     2   -.5   -.10     3   -.6   -.40     4   +.3   -.36     5   +.8   -.25     6   +2.4   -.05     7   +1.1   -.11     8   +3.0   +.20       a. Which three boars would she initially select using tandem selection:          1. when D230 is the first trait under selection? ___________________________           2.  when BF is the first trait under selection? ____________________________   b. Which three boars would she select using independent culling levels if the levels were set at 1 day for D230 and -.1 inch for BF?__________________________   c. Which boars would she select using an economic selection index in an independent one day decrease in D230 is worth $10 and an independent 1-inch decrease in BF is worth $100?         1. Using this information write the equation for the selection index (I)            2. Calculate an index value for all eight boars.           1 = __________                            5 = __________             2 = __________                            6 = __________            3 = __________                            7 = __________           4 = __________                            8 = __________   d. Which three boars would she select using the selection index? __________________

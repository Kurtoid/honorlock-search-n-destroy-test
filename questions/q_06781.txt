A computer analogy is used to explain
Light can only perform work in chloroplasts when the light energy is absorbed. Substances that absorb visible light are known as pigments. Different pigments absorb light of different wavelengths. Briefly explain why violet-blue light and red light work best for photosynthesis reactions yet leaves appear green to us.
The point at which photosynthetic rate is equal to respiration rate is called the

Riener Hospital has an x-ray machine with a book value of $60,000 and a remaining useful life of three years. At the end of the three years the equipment will have a zero salvage value. The market value of the equipment is currently $32,000. Riener can purchase a new machine for $145,000 and receive $28,000 in return for trading in its old machine. The new machine will reduce variable manufacturing costs by $27,000 per year over the three-year life of the new machine. The total increase or decrease in net income by replacing the current machine with the new machine (ignoring the time value of money) is:

34.08g of ammonia (NH3, molar mass = 17.04g/mol) is allowed to react with water in a foam coffee cup and the reaction produces a total mass of 186g of solution.  The reaction caused the temperature of the solution to rise from 21.00oC to 24.70oC.  What is the enthalpy of this reaction?  (Assume that no heat is lost to the surroundings or to the coffee cup itself and that the specific heat of the solution is the same as that of pure water: cH2O = 4.184 J/goC) Chapter 7 Equations: 1 cal = 4.184 Joules               1 L.atm = 101.325 Joules

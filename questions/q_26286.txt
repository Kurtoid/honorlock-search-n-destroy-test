You are given a directed graph G=(V,E) with weights w(e)>0 for each edge e.  There are two special vertices labelled s and t.    There is a list L of edges that you can add to G.  Your goal is to add exactly one edge from L into G so that you minimize the length of the shortest path from s to t in the new graph.   The list L is an array L=[e(1),e(2),...,e(k)] where the i-th edge e(i) has endpoints (y(i),z(i)) and has weight a(i)>0. We tell you k=O(n), so there are O(n) edges to consider to add. Note, the k edges in L are not in the original graph G.  Use the algorithms from class as black-boxes, namely DFS, BFS, Explore, Topological Sort, SCC, and Dijkstra's.  Describe your algorithm in words. No pseudocode. State the running time in terms of n=|V| and m=|E|, and note that k=O(n) so k should not appear in your running time. Faster is worth more.  Hint: you should only need a few calls of one of the graph algorithms.  Your algorithm can output the length of the shortest path from s to t in the new graph or it can output the edge you added, your choice.  Also, you can assume that at least one of the edges in L will decrease the length of the path from s to t.
Problem 3: Solar brightness incident on the earth, with earth-sun distance of d meters, is Bse Wm-2sr-1. If the radius of  sun is  rs meters, the radius of earth is re meters, and the sun radiates isotropically, how will the brightness change if the earth-sun distance is doubled? (2 points)

A 10-year-old boy has had multiple episodes of pneumonia and meningitis with septicemia since infancy. Causative organisms include Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. On exam, he has no organomegaly and no deformities. Labs show hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, hematocrit: 27.8%, platelets: 372,000/mm3, and WBC: 10,300/mm3. Hemoglobin electrophoresis shows 1% hemoglobin A2, 7% hemoglobin F, and 92% hemoglobin S. Which of the following images reflects the organ damage that most likely caused the repeated infections in this child?

Most social movements aim to change society, but they seek varying degrees of change. Social movements can be classified into four types on the basis of their goals. The first type is revolutionary movements, which seek total, radical change in society. Their goal is to overthrow the existing form of government and replace it with a new one. Revolutionary movements typically resort to violence or some other illegal action. Examples include the revolution for independence in the United States, the Chinese Communist revolution, and the Castro-led revolution in Cuba. The second type of social movement is reform movements. They seek only a partial change in society. They support the existing social system as a whole and want to preserve it, but they aim to improve it by removing its blemishes, typically throughlegal methods. Each reform movement usually focuses on just one issue. The civil rights movement seeks to rid society of racial discrimination. The women's movement seeks to eliminate gender inequality. The ecology movement seeks to put a stop to environmental pollution.     Third, resistance movements seek to preserve an existing system by resisting socialchange. The Ku Klux Klan and the United States Nazi party, for example, try to stop racial integration. In Muslim countries, the Islamic revolution seeks to protect the traditional Islamic ways of life against Western influences. Finally, expressive movements seek to change the individual, not society. Many are religious, aimed at converting individuals to a particular faith. These movements enable their members to express their sense of guilt, their joy of redemption, and their devotion to their religion. Examples include the Moonies, Hare Krishnas, and other sects.

A severe drought affected several western states for 3 years. A Christmas tree farmer is worried about the drought's effect on the size of his trees. To decide whether the growth of the trees has been retarded, the farmer decides to take a sample of the heights of 25 trees. Typically trees of this age have a mean height of 65 inches with a standard deviation of 9 inches. Assuming the distribution is bell shaped, where do you expect middle 95% of the tree heights to fall?

The zombie apocalypse strikes.  In your camp, some of the leaders hear that you had taken organic chemistry and come to you for help solving a problem.  Someone found a stockpile of gasoline at an old gas station.  The leaders would like to remove it from the underground tanks to store inside the camp.  They have found plastic barrels made out of PETE and LDPE.   Which barrels would make for better long-term storage of the gasoline: those made of PETE or LDPE? Explain.        You pull out an old chemistry textbook and find that PETE is polyethylene terephthalate while LPDE is low density polyethylene with the chemical structures noted above.  Hint: if you were watching the news about stockpiling gasoline the past couple of weeks, plastic bags are often made of thin layers of LDPE and not safe for storage of gasoline. Describe: 1) the chemical structures of the two plastics compared to gasoline; 2) what might happen to gasoline in each kind of plastic container. Give as much detail as you can.

Round all dollar amounts to the nearest dollar.  Enter a negative result using a minus "-" sign.   The management of Niantic Inc. is considering the purchase of equipment costing $320,000. The equipment has a useful life of eight years, with $20,000 residual value. The use of this equipment will produce positive annual cash flow of $60,000 for eight years, as well as $20,000 from sale of the equipment at the end of the eighth year. Use the present value factors provided below to compute the net present value of this investment, discounted at an annual rate of 10%.  Present value of $1 due in eight years, discounted at 10%, is 0.467. Present value of $1 received annually for eight years, discounted at 10% is 5.335.

Remember, once time runs out, it is too late to upload your Simio file without significant penalty in points so watch the clock. This is an open notes (closed book) test.  You can also use the Simio Help system. When you are finished, close Simio, then upload the Simio file before time runs out. Problem Description This model must have exactly two sources, exactly three servers, and exactly one sink.  Movement from a source to the first workstation visited by the entity is instantaneous.  Travel time between workstations is 5 minutes.  Travel distance from the final workstation to the sink is 1 mile and all entities travel at a speed of 10 kilometers per hour from the final workstation to the sink. This system consists of two part types (blue type and red type) and three single server systems called A, B, and C.  Blue arrivals occur 24/7 according to a Poisson process with rate 5 per hour.  During the daytime, from 6AM until 6PM, the blue arrivals are sent to A, and from 6PM until 6PM, blue arrivals are sent to B.  (Note, servers A and B operate 24/7 as long as there are parts waiting to be processed.)  After an entity is finished at A, it continues to C, then out of the system after C.  After an entity is finished at B, it continues to C, then out of the system after C.  For modeling purposes, have only one source for blue arrivals and color those entities blue.  For sending entities from the Blue Source to either WS A or WS B, use an Add-on Process.  There should be no link (i.e., no connection, time path, path, or conveyor) between the Blue Source and WS A or WS B.  (If you cannot get your program to run without a link, you may use one with a 12-point penalty.) Red arrivals occur 24/7 according to a Poisson process with a rate of 60 per day.  All red arrivals are sent directly to C, and after C they leave the system.  For modeling purposes, have one source for red arrivals and color those entities red.  Have only one sink for loading dock (i.e., for parts leaving the system). The processing time at Server A and B are both exponentially distributed with mean 10 minutes.  The processing time for a blue part on Server C is deterministic and equals 5 minutes.  The processing time for a red part on Server C is deterministic and equals 10 minutes.  This is a revenue producing system.  Every blue part that leaves the system yields $2 in revenue and every red part that leaves produces $5 in revenue. Consider the subsystem formed by Server C, its queue, and the path leading to the loading dock.  Your results tab should show at least three quantities:  (1) the long-run average number of parts (a single number for the total of both blue and red) in the subsystem, (2) the average number of minutes a blue part spends in the subsystem, and (3) the average long-run hourly revenue produced by the system (hourly revenue should be a single number not separated into revenue by part type).  I would like to see these numbers in the Results tab without having to do any calculations myself (for example, I don't want to multiply hours by 60 to get minutes, etc.).  Hint, it is probably easiest to use an add-on process for some of these calculations. You can partially check your work by calculating the theoretical hourly revenue and comparing it to your simulated vale for hourly revenue.  Please put your theoretical value in a Floor Label.  Run your model for 50 days.  To save time, you do not need to create an experiment.  You may not use the Math.If(  ) function.  If there are several ways to accomplish a specific task and no method is specifically mentioned, you may choose whichever you like best.  If a method is used that is extremely complex and an easier method is available, you may lose points for not understanding the straightforward method.  Use a floor label for comments or assumptions that you want me to see.

Figure 3(a) gives a memory array with 10 words, and each word contains 4 bits. Apply background data 0: 0000 and 1: 1111 using MATS++ shown in Fig. 3(b), and discuss the detection (entering S for sensitization and O for observation to a table) for stuck-at, transition, inversion coupling faults. Use a table like the one shown in Fig. 3(c) to fill in S and O or undetectable for each fault. Assumptions: (a) The inversion coupling faults are couple-dominating (instead of write-dominating) for adjacent cells in the same word. That is, after the logic value of a victim cell has been written into the cell, the coupling effect takes place.  Further assume that an aggressor cell only affects its immediate adjacent cells. (b) The memory array contains one fault. This single fault assumption is to simplify the answers. That is, you do NOT need to consider the case where faults are correlated. For example, when you consider a single stuck-at fault at cell A, you do not need to consider a coupling fault that will attack cell A.

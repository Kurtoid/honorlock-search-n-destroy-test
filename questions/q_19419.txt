Question 7 39 Points   Given the LP and its optimal solution max 4x1 + 3x2 + 7x3 st x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 = 0           x1* = 18, x2* = 0, x3* = 0, z* = 72     xB = [x1, s2, e3]   B-inverse = [   1          0          0                         1          1          0                         1          0          -1]   a. How much can the objective function value of x1 change without changing the optimal basis?   b. If the objective function value of x1 becomes 6, what is the optimal solution? x1 =                 x2 =                 x3 =                 z =     c. If the objective function value of x1 becomes 2, which variable becomes basic?  Will the objective function value increase or decrease?    d. Which constraints in the primal problem are binding?    e. Write the dual problem    f. Use the rules of complementary slackness to find the optimal solution to the dual problem.  Give the optimal solution value, the y variable values, and the values of all excess variables.

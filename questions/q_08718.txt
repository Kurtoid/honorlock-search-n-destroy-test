Round corn tortillas are made at a large facility that produces many tortillas per day.  The distribution of the diameters (distance from one side to the other) of all the tortillas made that day is approximately normal with a mean of 6 inches and a standard deviation of 0.11 inch.  A random sample of 35 tortillas is taken from the day's production.  What is the probability that the average diameter of the 35 tortillas is less than 5.95 inches?   a. Is this a problem about the sampling distribution of the sample proportion or the sample mean? [type]   b. What is the sampling distribution of the parameter? [sampdist]   c. What is the probability that the average diameter of the 35 tortillas is less than 5.95 inches? [probability]   d. Instead taking a random sample of 35 tortillas, you take a random sample of 4 tortillas.  Can you find the probability that the average diameter of the 4 tortillas is less than 5.95 inches? [popnorm]

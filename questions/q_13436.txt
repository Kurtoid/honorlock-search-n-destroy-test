Spherical planet Zoom has one moon, which is in a circular orbit about the planet.  Given:  mass of Zoom = 4.0 x 1022 kg.  mass of moon = 5.0 x 108 kg.  orbital radius of Zoom about its star  = 1.0 x 1011 m.   Orbital radius of moon about Zoom = 3.0 x 107.   Radius of Zoom = 2.0 x 106 m.  Radius of moon = 7.0 x 104 m. a)  Find the orbital velocity of the moon about Zoom. b)  Find the time for the moon to go around planet zoom once.  Start with given equations.  Show your work.

Which of the following statements about members of the Kingdom Plantae is FALSE?
A water-soluble anti-diabetic drug with a molecular weight of 208.4 g/mol has an absorption maximum at 281 nm and a molar absorptivity at this wavelength of 5.12 x 103 M-1 cm-1. One tablet of the drug was crushed and quantitatively transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask and the flask was filled to the mark with deionized water. This solution has an absorbance of 0.691 at 281 nm. A blank was prepared by treating a tablet with identical composition but without the anti-diabetic drug in an identical manner. The absorbance of this blank solution was 0.048 at 281 nm in a 1.00-cm cuvette. Calculate the mg of the anti-diabetic drug in the tablet. [R1] mg   Report your answer with 2 decimal places.

Label Q-pH (6 min.) You must show all your work for this problem on your paper.  You must show starting variables, starting equations, and use one step equation dimensional analysis where applicable.  In addition to showing you work on paper, you must state you final answer(s) here with units.  Failure to do so will result in zero credit regardless of your work on paper. Calculate the pH of the solution above after adding  35.0 mL 0.10 M HCl to a buffer solution prepared from a  0.120 M solution of a weak acid and a 0.210 M solution of the salt of this weak acid.  Assume no changes due to volume.  The Ka of the weak acid is 6.50 x 10-5. Show your work and upload for grading. Place final answer here.

Dr. Cotta is interested in the causes of behavioral problems among children. To study this, she employs the "Behavioral Tendencies" scale, which uses parents' and teachers' ratings to score children on a scale of 1-70. (Higher scores indicate more behavioral problems.) The population mean on this scale is 29.87. Dr. Cotta suspects that one of the many causes of behavioral problems is a stressful home environment.             She gathers a random sample of 100 children who have been classified as living in a stressful home. For this sample the mean score on the Behavioral Tendencies scale is 36.95. She computes the following test statistic: t = 2.38. If Dr. Cotta conducted a one-tailed hypothesis test (a = .01), a) what decision should she make regarding the null hypothesis?  b) Then in "plain English" what does this tell her about the effects of a stressful home environment on behavioral problems and include statistics in APA format?

The peppered moth is probably one of the most well know examples of natural selection in action. Prior to the industrial revolution, approximately 90% of the moth population exhibited a light color phenotype.  Shortly after the development of industry in Europe, people documented that tree trunks (and many other surfaces) had become darker in color because of air pollutants, and that approximately 80% of the moth population exhibited the dark color phenotype.  The change in the frequency of color phenotypes within the moth population was presumably due to predation by birds; dark colored moths are more visible on light trees than on dark trees and light colored moths are more visible on dark trees than light trees.  Design a study that addresses the question, "Is peppered moth coloration an adaptation that reduces predation by birds?"  In designing your study make sure that you: a) state your null hypothesis and one alternative hypothesis b) identify the general method that you will use to test your hypotheses, describe your study design c) make accurate predictions based on each of your hypothesis d) identify how the accuracy and precision of your results can be maximized.

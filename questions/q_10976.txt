PART II - BONUS QUESTIONS (Points WILL NOT be deducted, even if you answer the questions incorrectly.) Read the following news article and answer the questions at the end.     Scientists discovered a new organ under the skin A new sensory organ that can detect painful mechanical damage, such as pricks and impacts.      Pain has been believed to be initiated by activation of free nerve endings of the sensory neurons without end organs in the skin. It causes suffering and results in considerable costs for society. Almost one individual in each five experience consistent pain and there is an important need to discover new painkilling drugs. In any case, sensitivity to pain is likewise required for survival, and it has a protective function.  Scientists at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have found another sensory organ that can distinguish painful mechanical damage, for example, pricks and impacts. The newly discovered organ under the skin is sensitive to hazardous environmental irritation. It comprises of glia cells with multiple long protrusions and which collectively go to make up a mesh-like organ inside the skin. This organ is sensitive to painful mechanical damage, for example, pricks and pressure. The organ is organized with pain-sensitive nerves in the skin, and its activation leads to electrical impulses in the nervous system that result in reflex reactions and experience of pain. The organ is made of cells that are highly sensitive to mechanical stimuli, which explain how they can participate in the detection of painful pinpricks and pressure. During the experiments, scientists were able to block the organ successfully and observed the resultant decreased ability to feel mechanical pain. Professor Patrik Ernfors said, "Our study shows that sensitivity to pain does not occur only in the skin's nerve fibers, but also in this recently-discovered pain-sensitive organ. The discovery changes our understanding of the cellular mechanisms of physical sensation, and it may be of significance in the understanding of chronic pain." The discovery is being published in the journal Science. https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6454/695       Scientists were able to block the organ successfully and the result was ________.

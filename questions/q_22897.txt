Example: Given the functions f(x)=x2+1{"version":"1.1","math":"f(x)=x2+1"}  and  g(x)=x-3{"version":"1.1","math":"g(x)=x-3"}, find(f[?]g)(x){"version":"1.1","math":"(f[?]g)(x)"}. Solution:               (f[?]g)(x)=f(g(x))             =(x-3)2+1             =x2-6x+9+1{"version":"1.1","math":"(f[?]g)(x)=f(g(x))             =(x-3)2+1             =x2-6x+9+1"} Answer:  (f[?]g)(x)=x2-6x+10{"version":"1.1","math":"(f[?]g)(x)=x2-6x+10"} Exercise: Given the functions f(x)=x2+1{"version":"1.1","math":"f(x)=x2+1"}  and  g(x)=x-3{"version":"1.1","math":"g(x)=x-3"}, find  (g[?]f)(x){"version":"1.1","math":"(g[?]f)(x)"}.

As we discussed common law and stability in judicial decisions part of our discussion concerned the need for predictability and stability, but also balancing that with the need for the law to change with the changes in society.  One of the greatest case examples of this principle is the change in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson .  In the early 1950' s the U.S. Supreme Court decision in _______________________ overturned the earlier decision in  Plessy v. Ferguson and abolished this doctrine finding it to be inherently unequal.
1.13  Make the necessary change to ensure that the heading 'Time management' will always remain together with the paragraph under the heading on the same page. (Do not use the Enter key or a Page break to achieve this.)  (1)   1.14  Locate the text 'XXXXX' under the heading 'Time management'. Replace the text with a cross reference to Table 4, so that the sentence reads as follows: 'Jump to the table Enrolments and Graduations for a picture of the harsh reality.'       (2)   1.15 Locate Table 4 under the heading 'Not-so-great expectations' and do the following:     1.15.1  Edit the table so that it appears as shown below, by following the instructions under the screenshot. Note: Only the first few rows are shown.    Split the top left cell into two columns. Remove the diagonal borders from the top row. The data for the third column (Undergraduate Degree Enrolments) has not been entered (the cells in this column are empty).     Open the file 1UG_Degree_Enrolments, and copy all the data from this file as required into the third column. Close the file 1UG_Degree_Enrolments. (You do not need to save any changes to this file.) Right-click on this button and select the "Open link in new tab" option  (4)   1.15.2 Ensure that the column headings are repeated if the table flows over to the next page. (1)   1.15.3  Add a formula in the bottom right cell of the table to determine the total of the numbers in the column above it. The total must be displayed in the same number format as the other totals in this row, even if the formula is updated.  (2)   1.16  Locate the green placeholder > under the heading 'Not-so-great expectations'. Replace the placeholder with the chart in the spreadsheet 1Enrolments. The chart must be pasted in the Word document in such a way that any changes made to the chart in the spreadsheet will be reflected in the Word document automatically.  (2)   1.17  Locate the word 'fees' under the heading 'Unexpected expenses'.  Use a Word feature to ensure that this word will be included in an index. Insert an automatically generated index in the space provided under the heading 'Index' (on the last page), using the default settings.   (2)   1.18  Change the diagram under the heading 'Unexpected expenses' so that it is displayed as follows (do not change any colours):  Right-click on this button and select the "Open link in new tab" option  (3)   1.19  Locate the two dotted lines next to the text 'Name:' and 'Surname:' under the heading 'Appendix A'. Use tab settings to change the lines to solid lines, each exactly 10 cm long.  (2)   1.20  Locate the table for the Cell phone number under the heading 'Appendix A'. Change all the cells in the table to be exactly square, i.e. have the same height and width, without changing the height of the cells.  (1)   1.21  Locate the bibliography under the heading 'Bibliography' on the last page. Ensure that all the sources referenced in the document are displayed in the bibliography.  (1)   1.22  Change the page numbering in the document as follows:  On the second page of the document (the page on which the Table of Contents appears) change the page numbering format to 1, 2, 3, etc. and start the numbering from 1. Do not display a page number on the last page.   (3)   1.23 Insert a page border of your choice only on the second last page (the page containing the appendix).  (2)   1.24  Replace the date in the header with the current date in the format 29 August. The date must update automatically.  (2)   1.25  There are several places in the document where the spacebar was incorrectly pressed twice instead of once, resulting in two consecutive spaces between words. Use Find and Replace to correct all these spacing errors.  (1)   1.26 Ensure that the whole document is free of spelling errors. (Assume that there are no spelling errors in any of the tables.) (1)    Save the document and close it. Upload your saved version of 1Brochure.docx in Question 1 of the UPLOAD Quiz  (NO PDF FILES)   [50]

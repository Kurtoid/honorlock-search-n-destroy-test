For a typical Hawk-Dove game there are resources to be gained (e.g., food, mates, territories) that carry with them a payoff. Each of two players can choose to be aggressive, i.e., behave as a Hawk (H), or compromising, i.e., behave as Dove (D). If both players choose to engage in Hawk behavior, then they split the resources, but lose some payoff from injuries. If both players choose to behave as Doves, then they split the resources, but engage in some display of power that carries a display cost with it. Finally, if one player chooses to engage in Hawk behavior while the other chooses to behave as a Dove, then the player behaving as a Hawk gets all of the resources while the player behaving as a Dove leaves with no benefits and no costs. The resources available at a confrontation (e.g., food, mates, territories) are worth 40 payoff units.  The cost to a Hawk of being involved in Hawk-Hawk confrontation is 30 payoff units.  The display cost to a Dove of being involved in Dove-Dove confrontation is 10 payoff units. a)  (2 points)  Create a matrix to represent this scenario. b)  (1 points)  What will be the expected value for each type if 30% of the birds behave as hawks?  Which behavior has the advantage? c)  (6 points)  Determine the evolutionary equilibrium and its meaning.

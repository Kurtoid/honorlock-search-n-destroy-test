For priesthood exceedeth all other things;To us Holy Scripture they do teach.And converteth man from sin heaven to reach;God hath to them more power given,Than to any angel that is in heaven;With five words he may consecrateGod's body in flesh and blood to male,And handleth his maker between his hands;The priest bindeth and unbindeth all bands,Both in earth and in heaven;Thou ministers all the sacraments seven;Though we kissed thy feet thou were worthy;Thou art surgeon that cureth sin deadly;No remedy we find under GodBut all only priesthood.

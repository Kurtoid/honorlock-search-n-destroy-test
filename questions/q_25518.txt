Problem 4 (14 pts): Suppose a researcher is interested in determining how Florida's mosquito population is affected by rainfall.  For 9 months, he records the rainfall (in inches) and the number of mosquito eggs laid in a nearby pond.     Rainfall   2.7   4.9   6.2   5.3   9.8   5.7   2.3   0.7   3.4     Mosquito Eggs   5102   6545   7883   6901   9984   7142   5090   3688   6275      (1 pts) Find the correlation coefficient between rainfall and mosquito eggs. (3 pts) Determine whether a linear relation exists between the two variables. (2 pts) Find the least squares regression line. (5 pts) Interpret the slope and y-intercept of the least squares regression line if it makes sense to. (3 pts) Predict the number of mosquito eggs that should be laid in a month that had 5.5 inches of rain. Is this a good prediction?  Briefly explain.  Critical Values for Correlation Coefficient     n   Critical Value     3   0.997     4   0.950     5   0.878     6   0.811     7   0.754     8   0.707     9   0.666     10   0.632     11   0.602     12   0.576     13   0.553     14   0.532     15   0.514

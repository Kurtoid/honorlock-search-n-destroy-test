Azeotrope lab, Part 2 This is a file upload question. Answer this question on a piece of paper. Take a picture at the end of the test and upload the image. Make sure all parts of your answers are clearly legible. (e) (4 pts) If a mixture of A and B shows a strong negative deviation from Raoult's law, will it form a maximum-boiling or minimum-boiling azeotrope? Briefly explain. Sketch the temperature - mole fraction (xA and yA) plot of a mixture of A and B. (f) (4 pts) Pick a starting liquid composition with a smaller mole fraction of A than the azeotropic composition. Indicate the starting composition on the diagram above. If a mixture of A and B is distilled in a distillation tower (many theoretical plates), what will be collected in the liquid phase at the bottom of the tower and the vapor phase from the top of the tower, respectively? Justify your answer with illustration on the plot and a brief explanation.

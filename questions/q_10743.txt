Question #36-38 concern the genetic experiments below: In an interrupted mating experiment between a rifampicin-sensitive Hfr strain (genotype leu+ thr+ ala+ arg+ phe+) and a rifampicin-resistant F- strain (genotype leu- thr- ala- arg- phe-), the following data were obtained.  The results for each time point are shown as the number of colonies that grew on each plate for each sampling time.

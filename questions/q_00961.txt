(Q001) Texans across the political spectrum recognize the importance of higher education to the state's future. But the two major political parties in the state--Republicans and Democrats--do not see eye to eye on the crucial issues confronting higher education or how they should be addressed. In 2018 the Republican and Democratic party platforms presented very different visions of the future of higher education in Texas. Party platforms are statements of each party's views on major policy issues. The platforms are discussed and voted upon at each party's state convention, and party platforms are the best indicators of the collective thinking of the political parties.In recent years, conservative speakers discussing sensitive cultural topics such as race, ethnicity, and gender have sparked controversy on campuses across the country. Some schools have withdrawn invitations to speakers deemed too controversial for current campus life. In response, the Republican platform stressed the importance of maintaining a personal right to free speech and to practice one's faith. "We further urge that the legislature write legislation to protect the right of anyone who steps onto college campuses, to prohibit college campuses from stripping away their First Amendment rights of free speech and practicing their religions." Republicans called upon the state legislature to withdraw public funding from any university or college that actively or passively discriminates against speakers on campus. Republicans also stated that state universities should not make "special concessions based on religious practices that create undue burdens and costs on the institution."Democrats saw the rights problems in higher education differently, calling upon universities to "offer culturally competent and culturally diverse curricula, student activities, and student recruitment policies that promote understanding, respect, and acceptance." Democrats wanted to enforce policies that prevented discrimination or harassment against any person due to "race, sex, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, citizenship, or military status."The platforms also sharply disagreed on a number of financial problems facing higher education. While not addressing declining state support for higher education, Republicans called upon the legislature to take "reasonable measures to curtail tuition increases." Echoing concerns from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, Republicans called for the setting of limits on cumulative loans to students based upon the average annual earnings in a particular degree. The Republican platform also called for eliminating in-state tuition for all illegal aliens.The Democratic platform also called for rolling back tuition increases but replacing those lost funds with more state funding through a variety of programs. Democrats expressed concerns about the growing debt facing students attending universities and colleges in Texas. In contrast to the Republicans, they focused on increased funding in the form of state grants or a prepaid tuition program to replace one that went bankrupt years earlier. The Democratic platform also focused attention on the role played by community colleges in educating the workforce, calling for more funding of current programs and the provision of tuition-free community colleges to all Texas high school graduates.As long as Republicans dominate the three branches of state government in Texas, it is likely that the concerns of the Republican platform will play a larger role in shaping the policy agenda for higher education than those in the Democratic platform. Nevertheless, the ideas in the Democratic platform provide a sense of higher education policies if Democrats ever regain power in the state and a perspective on the alternative policies that will be offered in higher education policy debates.What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Republican and Democratic approaches to higher education policy in the state? Which party platform do you believe is a better approach to confronting the complex issues facing higher education?

Osteoclassts break down the hydroxyapatite portion of bone matrix by pumping free protons (H+) into the interstitial fluid just outside the bone matrix.  Proton pumping by osteoclasts can drop the local pH outside bone matrix from 7 to 4.  In this situation, the concentration of H+ has [A] by [B].
Tim Tebow is being treated in your facility. A friend of yours is a huge fan. You try to find out what Tim's medical details are in the facility's injury tracking software so you can tell your friend when you see them.  This action doesn't violate any laws or policies.
Three pounds of superheated vapor is contained in a piston-cylinder assembly, initially occupying a volume V1 = 30 ft3 at T1 = 300oF with u1 = 1104.6 Btu/lb. The vapor undergoes two processes in series:   Process 1-2: Constant-temperature compression to V2 = 11.19 ft3, during which there is an energy transfer by heat from the vapor of 1275 Btu.  Process 2-3: Constant-volume heating to a saturated vapor state at p3 = 120 lbf/in2 .   Sketch the two processes on a T-v diagram and clearly identify the states. Determine the work in Process 1-2. Determine the heat transfer in Process 2-3.  Use the tables provided. You can write your answers with units in the text box below and UPLOAD your work.

On the last day of shooting, the cameraman found that his last battery was dead, and that he couldn't film the last few minutes of the episode.  Ever resourceful, Orphy said he could build a battery that would work, at least for a short while, using a penny (copper metal), a nickel (nickel metal), and a lemon from the lemon tree growing by his log cabin.  Given the standard reduction potentials in the attached table, calculate the Eocell of this galvanic cell.  Turn in your work if you want partial credit!

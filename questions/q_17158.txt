(6 pts. - 3 pts. each)       Define the following two real estate investment strategies:      a.  Core Plus Investing      b.  Contrarian Investing     a.  (4 pts.)       Distinguish between investment value and market value.      b.  (4 pts.)      What principle of valuation is most closely associated with the sales comparison approach to property valuation?     a.  (3 pts.)       What is the primary difference between residential mortgage underwriting and commercial mortgage underwriting?      b.  (3 pts.)      What does the term "bridge financing" mean in commercial real estate lending?     a.  (3 pts.)       Briefly define due diligence in a real estate investing context.      b.  (4 pts.)      Briefly define sensitivity analysis in a real estate investing context.  How do we accomplish this?     (8 pts.)  Suppose that you project cash flows for a potential investment and find that there are three distinctly identifiable scenarios:         Probability   Return     Bad State   15%   3%     Status Quo   55%   14%     Good State   30%   22%       What is the expected return and standard deviation of returns for this investment?     (23 pts.)  You are thinking about buying a property with a projected net operating income (NOI) in year 1 of $200,000.  You expect the NOI to grow at an annual rate of 4% over your five-year holding period.  Your lender requires a 1.25 debt service coverage ratio in order to make a loan with a 30-year amortization period (no prepayment penalties or restrictions) at an interest rate of 6.5%.  You expect the capitalization rate at the end of your holding period to be 7%.      a.  If you require a return of 11% on this property type, how much could you pay for the property today?      b.  Assume you buy the property for $3,000,000 and take the maximum loan indicated in part (a). You already have almost all the numbers needed to compute the levered and unlevered before-tax IRR for this investment.  Do so.  Is leverage a good idea here?      c.  If, in addition, the lender is only willing to lend up to 60% loan-to-value, do the numbers in part (a) still work? What changes, if anything?     (14 pts.)  Suppose that you own a vacant piece of land that is zoned for any income-producing use.  You do some preliminary analysis of the "big 4" property types, and you find the following information about net operating income (NOI), NOI growth, rate of return requirements, and construction costs:     Property Type   NOI   NOI Growth   Rate of Return   Construction Cost     Retail   $500,000   2%   16%   $5,000,000     Apartment   $550,000   5%   10%   $9,000,000     Office   $750,000   4%   12%   $9,000,000     Industrial   $300,000   6%   9%   $7,000,000        What will end up being built on your piece of land once it is sold?       (13 pts.)  You are considering developing a new 140,000 sq. ft. office building.  You believe that you can acquire the necessary land for $1,600,000.  The total cost to construct the building you envision would be approximately $10,800,000.  Sitework will total $850,000.  You estimate that total soft costs, including financing costs, will be approximately $4,900,000.  You always build in a margin of 20% on preliminary calculations of this nature.  You think an appropriate going-in cap rate for the project is 9%.  After successfully operating the property for three years post-construction and achieving rent stabilization, you believe the cap rate will settle closer to cap rates for other office properties in your area at 7.5%.  You believe absorption will be relatively strong.  Thus, you think a vacancy allowance of 14% in year 1 is obtainable.  Based on your experience operating similar properties in the past, you believe an operating expense ratio of 45% is reasonable.      a.  What hurdle rent must be achieved to make this project feasible?      b.  What is the maximum amount you could pay for the land in this scenario?

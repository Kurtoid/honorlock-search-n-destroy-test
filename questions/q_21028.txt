The ages of a group of 138 randomly selected adult females have a standard deviation of 17.8 years. Assume that the ages of female statistics students have less variation than ages of females in the general  population, so let s=17.8 years for the sample size calculation. How many female statistics student ages must be obtained in order to estimate the mean age of all female statistics  students? Assume that we want 98 % confidence that the sample mean is within  one-half year of the population mean

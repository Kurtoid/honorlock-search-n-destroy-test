A woodland can support a combination of wrens (species 1) and warblers (species 2) competing for the same resources.  Suppose that, upon investigation, we find that there are enough resources for 1600 wrens if there were no warblers.  Conversely, suppose that we know that the resources could support 1000 warblers if there were no wrens.  Suppose also that 4 warblers have the same competitive effect on wrens that one wren has upon other wrens.  Finally assume that 5 wrens have the same competitive effect on warblers that one warbler has upon other warblers.  Again, species 1 is wrens, 2 is warblers. What is the coefficient of competition for the effect of warblers on wren?

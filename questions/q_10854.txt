They would explain that the elderly resident was being given the opportunity to purchase a freezer and that the price included frozen meats of various types.  As it was explained to the resident, the freezer was a bargain at $1,900 and that price included the "free" meat.  Further, the purchase could pay over time - just 36 monthly payments of $71.00.  The written purchase agreement did not disclose the fact that the effective interest rate under the installment payment method was 20% per year which was a rate much higher than applicable to typical consumer contracts.  In reality, the cost to Fresh Meats for the freezer and the meat was around $600 and a freezer of the type being sold by Fresh Meats could be purchased at Home Depot for around $400.

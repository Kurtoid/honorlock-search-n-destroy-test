Researchers are performing a clinical experiment to evaluate osteoporosis treatments. The response variable is bone density after 30 weeks. Two of the treatments are injectable (once a week or once a month), two of the treatments are daily pills (100mg and 500mg), one of the treatments is a fortified beverage taken daily, the final treatment is a control. Provide suitable coefficients for the following planned comparisons for the efficacy of five treatments for mild osteoporosis. Provide the coefficients and indicate the degrees of freedom for each contrast. (You may have to scroll to the right to see all the columns!)

On its own, a certain tow-truck has a maximum acceleration of 3.0 m/s2. What would be the maximum acceleration when this truck was towing a bus of twice its own mass?
An appellate court decision in which the litigants appeal the trial court's decision and the higher (appellate) court agrees with what the lower (trial) court has done.
In this stage, the food travels down the passage, which enters the stomach. Peristalsis is the motion that moves the food along this passage.
9) Assume the below G-CPU instructions have already been run, and the instruction that follows in part a, b, ..., or h will follow, i.e., each part (a-h) is independent from the preceding part.    The address for each of the instructions in parts a-h is $C008. Assume also that the 64k x 8 of memory is composed entirely of SRAM.  Hand-assemble the following G-CPU instructions and fill in the blanks using HEX.  EA is the 16-bit effective address.  All of your answers in this problem should be in hex. If there is no effective address, write "none". If a box is not needed, also write "none".
A plastics manufacturing plant dumps pollution into the Big River. This pollution leads to higher costs and disruption for fishermen on the river, for which they are not compensated. In this situation:

A 100.0 mL sample of 0.300 M NaOH is mixed with a 100.0 mL sample of 0.300 M HNO3 in a coffee cup calorimeter.  If both solutions were initially at 35.00degC and the temperature of the resulting solution was recorded as 37.00degC, determine the DHdegrxn (in units of kJ/mol NaOH) for the neutralization reaction between aqueous NaOH and HCl.  Assume 1) that no heat is lost to the calorimeter or the surroundings, and 2) that the density and the heat capacity of the resulting solution are the same as water.

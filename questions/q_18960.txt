Focus on Op-amp U2 (*Both op-amps have to be completely connected as shown in Figure A)  Use myDAQ's oscilloscope to capture the intermediate output waveform Vout1 (on Channel 0) and the final output waveform Vout2 (on Channel 1) superimposed. Set the amplitude scale of the oscilloscope for Channel 0 to 500 mV/Div, and for Channel 1 to 2 V/Div.  Set the time scale of the oscilloscope to 500 us/Div      Take a screenshot of the oscilloscope (both waveform in the same picture) and embed the screenshot as the answer for this question.  Report the value of Vout1(p-p) and Vout2(p-p) observed from the oscilloscope.  Calculate the experimemtal Gain2=?

A researcher compared the influence of low and high protein diets on the regeneration of lizard tails over the course of six weeks. The researcher hypothesized that the high protein diet would increase the rate of tail regeneration. The researcher found that the average regeneration amount in the high protein diet treatment was higher than the regeneration amount in the low protein diet treatment treatment: T = 5.21 and P = .0003. Which of the following is an appropriate inference for the researcher to make from their experiment?

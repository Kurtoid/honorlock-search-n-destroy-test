"Guatemala arde (burns) todos los anos al atardecer (evening) del 7 de diciembre con la tradicional Quema del Diablo. En varias partes del pais esta celebracion esta acompanada con musica de marimba, juegos pirotecnicos (fireworks) y el baile de toritos. El diablo (devil) se quema (burns) porque el fuego es un elemento purificador, puesto que la Virgen, destinada a concebir a Jesus, tiene que estar libre de la contaminacion del mal, indica Miguel Alvarez, cronista (columnist) de la Ciudad, a Prensa Libre. Por otro lado, los habitantes tienen la creencia (belief) que con la quema se eliminan los males y desventuras (misfortunes) sufridas durante el ano transcurrido (passed). Esta practica nacio (was born) en el siglo XVI como preambulo de las celebraciones navidenas. Actualmente, permanece arraigada (rooted) en el pueblo. Todos esperan cada 7 de diciembre para encender sus hogueras (bonfires)." (https://www.ngenespanol.com/culturas/diciembre-quema-del-diablo-guatemala/)    Ensayo.

GELO #6 - Question 6 Carl is conducting an experiment to determine if increased ultraviolet radiation from the decrease in the ozone layer is killing off frog tadpoles. After examining all of the data available in the library, Carl decides to go with a hypothesis that increased ultraviolet radiation from the sun is killing off the tadpoles.    Carl puts tadpoles into two groups. Group 1 involves 100 tadpoles in a five gallon container of water, which is covered by glass (knowing that the glass will filter out the ultraviolet radiation). Group 2 will be set up exactly like Group 1, except instead of being covered with glass, it is covered with an acrylic plexiglass, which will not filter out the ultraviolet radiation. Carl then places the groups outside for a period of one month, and observes the results.       Which group is the control group (Group 1 or Group 2)?

An enzyme-catalyzed reaction was carried out with the substrate concentration initially 1,000 times greater than the Km for that substrate. After 3 minutes, 1% of the substrate had been converted to product, and the amount of product formed in the reaction mixture was 24 mmol. If, in a separate experiment, one-fourth as much enzyme and twice as much substrate had been combined, how long would it take for the same amount (24 mmol) of product to be formed?

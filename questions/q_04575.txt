Nitrogen gas flows through an insulated valve at steady state. The inlet and outlet pipes have the same diameter D = 1 cm.  The inlet conditions are P1 = 2 bar, T1 = 298 K, and u1 = 1 m/s. The outlet pressure is P2 = 1 bar. You may assume ideal gas behavior, with cp = 7/2 R. The molecular weight of nitrogen gas is 28.0 g/mol. Determine the outlet velocity u2 and the outlet temperature T2.  It is not important to obtain the correct numerical answer for this question, but rather to set up the equations correctly.

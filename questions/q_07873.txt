There's a pond in your neighborhood that is shaped like a triangle. There are benches near the pond edge at each point of the triangle, and people will occasionally sit on those benches and feed bread to the ducks. On average, there are four people sitting on the benches at point A, three people sitting on the benches at point B, and only one person sitting on the bench at point C (it's too far from the parking lot).  Assuming all of the bench-sitters bring a loaf of bread each, if the pond has a population of 24 ducks, how many would you expect to find at each of the three points, according the the ideal free distribution model? (P.S. Don't feed ducks bread; it's bad for them!) A: [A] B: [B] C: [C]

Jill was hired as a sales associate for Kates Cupcakes, an upscale dessert-and-drinks (smoothies, tea, coffee, and almost anything else imaginable).  In her third week on the job, Kate, the owner, simply says to Jill, "Hey, Jill, we need a blender - when you get a chance in the next couple days, please buy a blender." Jill goes to Target, sees that there are five different models, all of which are newer and, in some ways, "better" than the older models Kates Cupcakes has been using. Deciding that in the long run it might be most cost-effective and more in keeping with the Kates Cupcakes image, ambiance, and products, Jill buys the most expensive blender that Target sells. When Kate finds out, she is furious and refuses to pay. Kate says that all she wanted was a simple blender. Who would win in court, Jill or Kate, and why?

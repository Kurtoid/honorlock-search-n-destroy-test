Sam owns a small bar. He hires bartenders, but he checks IDs himself at the door. Under a local law applying to bars, he can be prosecuted for providing alcohol to a minor if he "knowingly admits or serves alcohol to any person under the age of 21 years." Sam's son is a senior at the local high school. A group of boys come to the bar one night who look familiar. Sam thinks that some of them are classmates of his son, but he is not sure.

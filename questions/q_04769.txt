Solve the following excavation problem:   A contractor is excavating the trench below.  He is supposed to dig the trench 5 ft deep x 2 ft wide.  The soil was tested to have an approximate swell factor of 12% and a shrinkage factor of 15%.  The contractor is placing an 8" Diameter water pipe in the trench and then backfilling with the soil that was removed.  The dimensions are provided.  Use exact dimensions for the excavation and do not add working space.   Calculate the amount of earthwork for excavating the trench.  Assume that the topsoil was already removed, and the excavation has vertical edges and not sloped.  (15 points) Find the amount in CY for fill in loose condition (After excavation). (3 points) If 70% of the excavated material is being used for backfilling, find the equivalent volume of fill after compaction. (2 points) Calculate the amount of topsoil (6" thick) to be removed at the entire footprint of the structure (not only at the trench excavation).  (5 points)                     Note:  Show all calculations neatly and fill the attached tables for quantity take offs for excavations, concrete and reinforcement.

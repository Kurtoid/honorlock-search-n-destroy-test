Destabilization due to gauche interactions is observed in the di-equatorial chair conformer of trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexanes (illustrated below). If the energetic penalty of the Cl/Cl gauche interaction is 1.20 kJ/mol and the DGdeg (eq to ax) for a Cl atom is 0.53 kJ/mol, what is the difference in energy between the di-axial and di-equatorial chair forms of trans-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane? Report your answer to two decimal places in kJ/mol and do not include the units or the algebraic sign.

Read the following scenario and answer the question below. Burning fossil fuels and their derivatives produces, among other things, harmful pollutants such as particulates, acid rain-producing sulfur and nitrogen oxides, and carbon oxides. These air pollutants threaten ecosystems all over the world, and high carbon dioxide levels contribute to global warming. Furthermore, fossils fuels have a limited supply. The market price of fossil fuels, especially crude oil, has continued to rise in recent years. Despite this, Americans continue to consume fossil fuels at alarming rates and rely upon them for most of energy needs. At various times, the federal government has considered mandating higher fuel efficiency standards for American vehicles as a possible solution to this environmental energy crisis. Most auto manufacturers, however, are opposed to the imposition of standards. Which of the following would contribute to a rapid increase in crude oil prices?

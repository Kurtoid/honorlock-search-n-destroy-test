Mitch (age 22) becomes highly aroused by the fantasy of humiliating and shaming a sexual partner during sexual activity. He imagines whipping his partner and treating her like a child. However, Mitch has never engaged in this behavior because the one time he proposed this fantasy to a past sexual partner, she was horrified and left the relationship. Mitch has not discussed this fantasy with his current partner, and in fact part of what arouses him is the thought of his partner saying 'no' and trying to escape. Despite this, Mitch does not want to jeopardize his relationship, though he is finding it harder to become sexually aroused without thinking of causing suffering to his partner during sex. What disorder does Mitch have?

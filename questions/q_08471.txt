"The misfortunes and decline of this country [Bengal, a region in eastern India] began on the day of the Muslim conquest. Just as a storm wreaks destruction and disorder upon a garden, so did the unscrupulous and tyrannical Muslims destroy the happiness and good fortune of Bengal. Ravaged by endless waves of oppression, the people of Bengal became withdrawn and timid. Hinduism, our native religion, also took distorted forms. But there are limits to everything.

The resumption of Bengal's good fortune began on the day the British flag was first planted on this land. Tell me, if Muslim rule had continued, what would the condition of this country have been today? It must be loudly declared that it is to bless us that the Lord Brahma has brought the English to this country. British rule has ended the atrocities of Muslim rule.

The numbers in the table represent profits.           s1   s2   s3     d1   3000   1200   1500     d2   1000   1800   1400     d3   5000   500   1200        Assume that we have no information about the probabilities of the states of nature, s1,s2,s3.  Use the Maximax approach to choose a decision Use the maximin approach to choose a decision   Assume now that we have probability estimates for these states as follows p(s1) = .2, p(s2)  = .3, p(s3) = .5  Using the expected value approach, which decision should be chosen. What is the Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) for this problem?

There are 11 students in a class.  Each class period, the instructor selects students to work problems on the board.  The instructor indicates that selection of students is random (equal opportunity for selection, uniform distribution).  Over the term, 66 questions were put on the board.  Students were selected as follows:      Number of occurrences   1 Nairoby 4   2 Robin 5   3 Silvia 7   4 Jose 8   5 Jasmine 4   6 Matthew 10   7 Etenia 4   8 Kishmere 6   9 Grigory 5   10 Yuting 7   11 Melanie 3    Some students think that the distribution was not random and decide to test the hypothesis that the distribution was uniform. What is the contribution of Jasmine to the kh2test statistic?

BONUS (5 points)Does treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function following a heart attack?  The table below provides summary statistics for an experiment to test ESCs in sheep that had a heart attack.  Each of these sheep was randomly assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts' pumping capacity was measured in the study.  A positive value corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which generally suggests a stronger recovery.     n x - bar s   ESCs 9 3.50 5.17   control 9 -4.33 2.76    The point estimate for the difference is 7.83 and standard error is computed at 1.95. Find and interpret the p-value for a one-sided test for evidence that ESC improves heart function.  Show your work to receive full extra credit.

You are a scientist in a biotech company that produces custom engineered tissues for patients. Your current project is to develop a bone replacement for a 30-year-old patient who lost part of his pelvis through cancer. After loading autologous stem cells into a polycaprolactone scaffold and implanting them in an animal model, you determine there is low bone formation. You decide to incorporate resveratrol, a small molecule drug that promotes osteogenesis into your scaffold. Note: Polycaprolactone is highly hydrophobic with a slower degradation rate than poly-l-lactic acid. 1. Will the scaffold undergo bulk degradation or surface erosion and why? (2 points) 2. How will this mode of scaffold degradation (in 1 above) result in burst or linear release of the loaded drug? (2 points)

If you want someone to come closer to you,  you might supinate your hand and flex your index finger a few times as if to say "come here".   The tendons that allow you flex your fingers also cross the wrist joints.  Why don't you flex your entire hand in such a situation?  What muscle function is employed on the extensor side of the wrist to prevent the entire hand from flexing?

Implementing an Efficient sorting of O(n log k) for k-sorted integer list of length n   Implement a function ksort void function that sorts the K-sorted list which being passed as an argument. [14 points]  The ksort has the following two parameters;   k: positive integer   klist:    The ksort is a void function;  However, as a side-effect from the function, the klist must be sorted in ascending numeric order.        Explain how to achieve O(n log k) run-time complexity and explain run-space complexity of the algorithm that you used for the implementation. [6 points]  Description Given an array klist of n elements, where each element is at most k away from its target position, devise an algorithm that sorts in O(n log k) time. For example, let us consider k is 2, an element at index 7 in the sorted array, can be at indexes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in the given array.  Sample Input  k : 3klist: [6, 5, 3, 2, 8, 10, 9]  Expected side-effect from the ksort for the sample input above  klist: [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]   Constraints         0 < k

The Roman historian Plutarch wrote about Pyrrhus: We are told that Pyrrhus said to one who was congratulating him on his victory, "If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined." For he had lost a great part of the forces with which he came, and all his friends and generals except a few; moreover, he had no others whom he could summon from home, and he saw that his allies in Italy were becoming indifferent. Where was home for the unfortunate Pyrrhus?

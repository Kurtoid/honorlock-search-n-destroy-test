Pooler Corporation is working on its direct labor budget for the next two months. Each unit of output requires 0.15 direct labor-hours. The direct labor rate is $7.00 per direct labor-hour. The production budget calls for producing 6,500 units in April and 6,200 units in May. The company guarantees its direct labor workers a 40-hour paid work week.

What would be the total combined direct labor cost for the two months?

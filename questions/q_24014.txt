KiwiC for Vitality: Results of a Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial Testing the Effects of Kiwifruit or Vitamin C Tablets on Vitality in Adults with Low Vitamin C Levels. Nutrients 2020, 12, 2898. Researchers from Otago's Department of Psychology conducted a study to test the effects of Kiwifruit or Vitamin C tablets on vitality in adults with low Vitamin C levels. "Throughout the entire eight-week trial, participants were sent brief smartphone surveys every alternate night to measure secondary covariates of self-reported sleep and physical activity, plus other outcomes not discussed in this report. A total of 29 smartphone surveys were sent to participants every other night around 6 p.m. for the duration of the study, starting the day of their first clinic visit and ending on the day of their last clinic visit. They were asked to respond to the survey that night before going to bed. If participants missed a smartphone survey, they were sent an email the following evening, which included a link to complete a make-up smartphone survey for the following day. If another consecutive survey was missed, a research assistant called the participant to confirm that there were no technical issues, and to ensure that the participant was still happy to participate."

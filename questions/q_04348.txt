Merle is a marking pattern in dog coats that appears as a marbling color in a solid coat. The merle gene displays incomplete dominance:   CSCS display a solid coat  CMCS  individuals are merle and show patches of fur with a lighter, mottled effect  CMCM individuals are "double merle" and show patches of fur with much more pronounced lightening.  Another gene, FGF5, also influences coat phenotype and determines whether dogs display long or short coats, with short coats being completely dominant to long coats. Determine the proportion of offspring phenotypes that would result when two merle dogs mate. If both are heterozygous (Ll) for the gene that regulates coat length. Write your answer only as a fraction, for example, 1/2.  double merle with short coat: [dmsh] double merle with long coat: [dmlc] merle with short coat: [msc] merle with long coat: [mlc] solid with short coat: [ssc] solid with long coat: [slc]

36. In the figure, a new beneficial allele, B, arises on a chromosome containing the ordered loci A, B, C, D, and E, depicted in the top panel. After reproduction, those chromosomes possessing the B allele increase in frequency. Over time, recombination breaks up the association of the B allele with the A, C, D, and E alleles. Assuming that the five loci are spaced evenly along the chromosome, the first pair of allele combinations to be broken up will most likely be  _____.

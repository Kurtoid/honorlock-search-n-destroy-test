A student releases a ball from a height of 100 cm above the ground. The ball bounces to a height of 80 cm. The diagram below shows the ball's position at five different times from its starting point to its maximum height after the first bounce. Use the diagram to address the questions below.  A. Explain why the ball has kinetic energy at positions 2 and 4. (1 point) B. As the ball falls from position 1 to position 3, determine the height at which the ball has approximately equal amounts of kinetic energy and potential energy. Include units in your answer. (1 point) C. Why doesn't the ball bounce back to the original position of 100 cm? Where is the energy going? Relate this to the Law of Conservation of Energy. (1 point)

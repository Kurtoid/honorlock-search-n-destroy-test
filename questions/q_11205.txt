On Monday news reached us that the French* had printed a proclamation in Arabic and had sent it around to be read in public, calling upon Egyptians to obey them. A copy of that document came into my possession and I will quote it here: 'In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate. On behalf of the French Republic which is based upon the foundations of liberty and equality, General Bonaparte addresses all Egyptian people: O ye Egyptians, some may tell you that we have come here to abolish your religion, but that is a lie. The real purpose of our campaign is to restore your rights from your oppressors--the Mamluk** rulers of Egypt. Know that all people are equal and that only differences in the degree of reason, virtue, or knowledge may be used to elevate one person above another. But what reason, virtue, or knowledge do the Mamluks have that gives them the right to claim the most fertile land, the most desirable dwellings, and the highest government positions in Egypt? None whatsoever.' In that proclamation, their statement 'In the name of Allah, etc.' suggests that they agree with Islam. But in reality they are opposed to both Christianity and Islam and do not hold fast to any religion. They are materialists who deny the Hereafter and Resurrection, and who reject Prophethood and religious Messengership. In politics, too, they do not have a single ruler, like other countries, who can speak on their behalf. *In 1798 a French army led by Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt in an attempt to threaten Great Britain's access to its colonial empire in India. **the ruling class in Egypt at the time, mostly made up of non-Egyptians --Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti, Egyptian religious scholar and resident of Cairo, eyewitness chronicle of the French occupation of Egypt, 1798-1801 The inspiration for the sentiments expressed by Napoleon had roots in

Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show, That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,-- Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know, Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,-- I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe; Studying inventions fine her wits to entertain, Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburn'd brain. But words came halting forth, wanting invention's stay; Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows; And others' feet still seem'd but strangers in my way. Thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes, Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite, "Fool," said my Muse to me, "look in thy heart, and write.

A woman brings her 16-year-old son to the clinic for evaluation of his behavior. She explains that her son is failing most of his classes despite being smart, and she is worried he will not graduate from high school. He has skipped school regularly since the 5th grade and frequently lies to his mother about his whereabouts. The patient says his teachers are not as smart as he is, and he refuses to do any homework because it is a "waste of time". He has been suspended several times for fighting and was once caught stealing a wallet from the teacher's break room. The patient uses alcohol and marijuana but is not willing to say how often. His mother reports he often stays out past curfew and has come home intoxicated a few times. The patient sits awkwardly and appears annoyed about being brought to the appointment. He argues with his mother throughout the evaluation, and his responses to the physician are short and sarcastic. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient's behavior?

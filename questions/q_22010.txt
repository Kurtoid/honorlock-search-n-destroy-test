A nutrition store in the mall is selling an herbal supplement intended to influence memory. To test the effectiveness (i.e., the influence on memory) of the herbal mixture, a skeptical researcher obtains a sample of n = 49 people and requests that each person take the suggested dosage each day for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4-week period, each individual takes a standardized memory test (large numbers indicate better memory). The scores from the sample produced a mean of M = 33. In the general population, the standardized memory test is known to have a mean of u = 30 and s = 14. Do the sample data support the conclusion that the herbal supplement influenced memory? To answer this question, go through the 7 steps for hypothesis testing and use a = .05 (critical value = +-1.96). SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. 1) IV: [IV] DV: [DV] number of tails: [tails] 2) State Hypotheses: Null: [Null] Alternative: [Alternative] 3) Describe where the critical region(s) would be on a distribution. [critical] 4) Calculate the z-score for the sample mean (if possible bold, underline, or indicate your final answer). Show your work. Numerator for z-score = [Numerator] Denominator for z-score = [Denominator] z-obtained = [z-score] 5) Decision: [Decision] 6) Effect size:  Calculation/work: [Calculation] d = [Effect] 7) Plain English interpretation: [PE] APA statistical information: [APA]

Its value, , can be modeled as a linear function  based on age. (a) What does the independent variable  represent? What does the dependent variable  represent? (b) Write the linear function  modeling the value of the car. (c) Use the function from part (b) to algebraically determine the value after 6 years. Report your answer with appropriate units. (d) Use the function from part (b) to algebraically determine when the car will be worth $15,750. Report your answer with appropriate units. (e) Graph . Select a scale and label your axes so that the value of the machine can be graphed from its original time of purchase until the year when its value becomes zero.

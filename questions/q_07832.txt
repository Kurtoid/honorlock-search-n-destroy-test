A 45-year-old male with a past medical history of Type 2 Diabetes presents for a routine visit. He is currently taking canafaglifozin (Invokana), a SGLT2 inhibitor. Which finding would be expected in this patient and not necessarily indicate an abnormality?    Correct:  glycosuria   Canagliflozin (Invokana) is a SGLT2 inhibitor which workins in the kidney allowing more glucose to leave the  blood and be excreted via the urine. Therefore, glycosuria is an expected finding in patients taking this class of medication.

A 1.00 L buffer solution is 0.250 M in HF and 0.250 M in LiF.  Calculate the pH of the solution after the addition of 0.150 moles of solid LiOH.  Assume no volume change upon the addition of base.  The Ka for HF is 3.5 x 10-4.   Chapter 17 & 18 equations: pH = -log[H3O+] pOH = -log[OH-] pH + pOH = 14.00 Kw = 1 x 10-14 Ka x Kb = Kw = [H3O+][OH-] pKa = -log Ka pH = pKa + log

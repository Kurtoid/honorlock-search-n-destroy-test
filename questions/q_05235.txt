3. The American Rifleman (June 1993) reported on the velocity of ammunition fired from the FEG P9R pistol, a 9mm gun manufactured in Hungary.  Field tests revealed that Winchester bullets fired from the pistol had a mean velocity (at 15 feet) of 936 feet per second and a standard deviation of 10 feet per second.  Tests were also conducted with Uzi and Black Hills ammunition.  Assume that the velocity distributions are mound shaped.  (b) A bullet, brand unknown, is fired from the FEG P9R pistol.  Suppose the velocity (at 15 feet) of the bullet is 1,000 feet per second.  Is this bullet likely to be manufactured by Winchester?  Explain

I promised you a question that was the same as on the sample questions; well, here it is. I used to watch a television show called Restaurant Impossible. The show features a (jerk) chef who visits a failing restaurant and then does his best to save it. On one episode, the chef used the restaurant's Point of Sale (POS) data, which has information about the restaurant's revenues from its sales, to tell the owners that unless they changed something (their menu according to the chef) the restaurant should not be open for lunch. The chef explained that for lunch time the cost of the food plus what the servers were paid exceeded their revenue from the food that was sold. He did not mention the rent the owners paid for their restaurant. Was the chef correct to omit the rent? Explain your answer.

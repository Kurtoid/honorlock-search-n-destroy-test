A rural southern county has a revenue shortfall. A property tax initiative is placed on the ballot. A large independent simple random sample of voters yields the following information:          Let event A be the voter favors the proposed tax,          and event B be that the voter is a property owner. Then Pr (A|B) = .394, Pr (A| Bc) =.943 and Pr (B) = .764, Pr (Bc) = .236   NOTE: Pr (B) + Pr (Bc) = 1 by definition. Given this data and the following formula answer the following question, what is P(A)?   Pr (A) = Pr(A|B) Pr(B) + Pr(A| Bc)Pr(Bc)
Given the following road map as shown in class. Consider a search tree (the root node has depth 0) that illustrates the state-space explored by A* starting from the city Timisoara (T). Answer questions about the search tree below. The nodes are labeled using the first letter of the names of the cities on the map. Remember, nodes that have already been explored should not be explored again.      Use the Straight-line distance in the table shown above for the estimated cost h(n) between node n and the node of the final destination B for Bucharest. Use g(n) as the true cost from the origin to node n. Remember that A* uses f(n) = h(n) + g(n) to estimate the total cost from the origin to the destination. Begin with the following root node T for Timisoara and the immediate two child nodes:    Which of the following nodes are the child nodes of A? Mark all that are child nodes.

Suppose you work at AMD and have a CPU which executes a program consisting of 50% floating point divide with average CPI = 10, 30% floating point multiply with average CPI = 6, and the remaining 20% are from other instructions with average CPI = 2. Your boss wants a new version of the CPU to run 2 times faster. You can make the divide run at most 5 times faster and the multiply run at most 6 times faster. Can you meet our boss's goal by making only one improvement (and which one), or both, or is it not possible? (Hint: the number of instructions for the program will remain the same across the two CPUs)

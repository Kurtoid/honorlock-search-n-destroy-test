A random sample of ozone concentration in parts per billion (ppb) in a region is provided below: 68.7   70.0   78.4   73.1   68.5   78.1   73.4   77.8   68.2   77.9   73.4 a) Compute the sample coefficient of variation. Using the empirical CDF of the sample, compute: b) The sample median. c) The probability that ozone concentration exceeds 70ppb. d) The 85% quantile of ozone concentration in the region. Note: Use the lowest rank to adjust the estimated eCDF values for repeated observations.

How much heat does it take to raise 50.0 g of liquid water to 120 degC if its initial temperature is 50 degC? (Possibly useful values: Cwater = 4.184 J/g[?]degC, Csteam = 1.99 J/g[?]degC, Cice = 2.108 J/g[?]degC, DHfus = 6.01 kJ/mol, DHvap = 40.79 kJ/mol)
During a stretching maneuver, you apply a 30-second stretch of a shortened muscle group just up to the point of tissue resistance. After this maneuver, rather than relaxing with the patient and returning the body segment to a neutral position, you move the body segment into the newly gained range to apply another stretch of the same muscle group and hold the stretch for an additional 30 seconds. What term best describes this type of stretching?

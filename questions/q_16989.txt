OEDIPUS: O Tiresias, who grasp all things,both what can be learned and what is unspeakable, both of heaven and treading the earth,even if you cannot see, you still understandwhat sickness plagues our city, and we find, lord, you alone are our savior and defender.For Phoebus, if you have not heard this alsofrom the messengers, in response to our question said relief from this sickness would only comeif we should discover and punish wellthe murderers of Laius or send them forthas fugitives from this land. Therefore,grudging nothing from the speech of birdsor something known from another sortof divination, save yourself and the city,and save me, and ward off all the pollutionfrom the dead man. We are in your hands,and to help a man from troubles when you have the power is the sweetest of labors. TIRESIAS: Alas, alas! How terrible to know when it does not help the knower; for knowing this well I let it slip--I should not have come here. OEDIPUS: What's this? How dispiritedly you have come! TIRESIAS: Send me home, for you will bear your lot easily and I mine, if you will yield to me. OEDIPUS: You speak neither clearly nor helpfullyto this city, which raised you, if you guard your thoughts. TIRESIAS: For I see that your words come at the wrong time, and since I would not suffer the same thing... OEDIPUS: No, by the gods, don't hold back what you know, when all of us as suppliants bow down before you. TIRESIAS: None of you understand, but I shall never reveal my own troubles, and so I shall not say yours. OEDIPUS: What are you saying? You will not explain what you understand, but rather intend to betray us and destroy the city. TIRESIAS: I cause no pain for you or myself. Why do you vainly seek this? For you can learn nothing from me. OEDIPUS: You worst of wicked men! You would anger a stone! Will you reveal nothing, but instead show yourself unmovable and impractical? TIRESIAS: You have found fault with my anger, but your own, living within you, you did not see, but blamed me. OEDIPUS: Who could hear such words and not grow angry, words with which you dishonor the city? TIRESIAS: It will end the same, though I hide it in silence. OEDIPUS: Why not, then, tell me what will come anyway? TIRESIAS: I should explain no further. At these things, if you wish, rage as much as your heart is able. OEDIPUS: I Indeed, since I am so angry, I'll pass over none of what I understand. Know that I thinkyou, too, had your hand in this deed and did it, even though you did not kill with your own hands. But if you could see, I would think the deed yours alone. TIRESIAS: Really? I say to you: abide by that decree you made earlier, and from this day address neither these men here nor me, since you are the unholy polluter of this land. OEDIPUS: Did you throw out this word so boldly? And where do you think you will escape it? TIRESIAS: I have escaped it, for I hold the potent truth. Who told you to say this? It is no prophecy!You did! For you forced me to speak unwillingly! OEDIPUS: Who told you to say this? It is no prophecy! TIRESIAS: You did! For you forced me to speak unwillingly!

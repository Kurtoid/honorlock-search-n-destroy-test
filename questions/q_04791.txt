At the beginning of the year, Orchid's Co.'s management considers making an offer to buy Lilly Corporation. Lilly's projected operating income (EBIT) for the current year is $100 million. Orchid believes that if the two firms were merged, it could consolidate some operations, reduce Lilly's expenses, and raise Lilly's EBIT to $150 million. Neither company uses any debt; both pay income taxes at a 30% rate. Orchid has a better reputation among investors, who regard it as better managed and also less risky. Orchid's stock has a P/E ratio of 20 versus a P/E of 10 for Lilly. Since Orchid's management will be running the entire enterprise after a merger, investors will value the resulting corporation based on Orchid's P/E. Based on expected market values, how much synergy should the merger create? Note that E(Earnings)=EBIT*(1-Tax).

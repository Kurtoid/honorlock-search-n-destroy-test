When she stopped at a red light, she unbuckled her seat belt in order to take her coat off. A police officer happened to notice that Amanda was not wearing her seat belt and pulled her over. Amanda was very upset when the officer charged her, under section 106(2) of the Highway Traffic Act, for not wearing her seatbelt. The officer assured her that it was a minor offence with no possibility of jail time. When she told the officer that she was terrified about going to court, he told her that she could just pay the fine instead of going to court.    If the officer didn't charge her on that date, what would be the last possible day for service of an offence notice on Amanda?

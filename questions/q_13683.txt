Identify and name the threats to internal and external validity issues as many as you could in the following excerpt from a study discussion. Then, briefly discuss what they are and justify your selections. *Hints are denoted in bold.   "The study sample was restricted to young adults, so results cannot be generalized to other ages. The multisensor wearable device was worn on the upper arm, which may not reflect the effectiveness of more contemporary devices worn on the wrist...... Moreover, the use of wearable technology was not initiated at the onset of the intervention, which may have influenced how the participants adopted and used the technology during their weight loss efforts. The device used was also commercially available, and therefore the investigators did not have control over any additional information that may have been provided through the website available for use with this device. Dietary intake was assessed using self-report, which may have affected the accuracy of this measure and therefore influenced the understanding of how the intervention influenced this aspect of energy balance. Additional investigation is also needed to examine for whom wearable devices and other technologies may be effective within the context of weight loss efforts and how these technologies influence other components of weight loss, namely, eating behavior and dietary intake."

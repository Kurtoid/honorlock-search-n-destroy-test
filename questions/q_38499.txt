You are heavily in debt as a result of betting large sums of money on Greyhound (Dog) Races in Naples, Florida.  A friend of yours reveals that she learned to classify muscle fiber types when she participated in a BIMS 489 research project at TAMU.  She owes you a huge favor, so you ask her to histologically examine biopsies of the hamstring muscles that have been secretly obtained from 5 dogs entered into next week's high stakes race.  She reluctantly agrees and gives you the following report comparing the skeletal muscle cells and vascularization of these muscles:                                   Dog 1 - most extensive capillary network                                 Dog 2 - highest concentration of mitochondria                                 Dog 3 - largest fiber diameter                                 Dog 4 - greatest concentration of myoglobin                                  Dog 5 - highest ratio of low myosin ATPase to high myosin ATPase                   Being a betting person and desperate to get out of debt, you quickly violate all ethical and legal standards and bet on the race.  Recognizing that the upcoming sprint is for an extremely short distance, you should place your bet on:

Please read the following to respond to the remaining three essay questions.  Case Study #5: Servant Leadership in Advertising Sales Brandon managed a district sales office for a national medical magazine published quarterly. His 12 sales reps were experienced, all having more than three years with the company; however, they were just learning how to sell Internet advertising in addition to the traditional print ads. This combination was extending the time needed on appointments, which was increasing the sales cycle. This was not going to be a good meeting, Brandon thought as he spoke to his reps, beginning with the bad news. "People, we have a problem. This next edition goes to press in eight weeks and we have only 60% of our existing accounts handled. This is a big problem because it leaves our artists and printers only a couple of weeks to publish the next issue. It's already created a cash flow shortage of $290,000 short of what was budgeted. Worst-case scenario, if we miss our deadline with the printer, we have to pay $30,000 for every day we go over. "Bottom line, chances are that my boss is going to bring in reps from other offices to help us. That means fewer accounts for you to handle, which means a smaller paycheck for everyone. He's already started calling around to arrange for help, even though I told him we can handle this on our own. I don't mind taking another run at him, but I wanted to discuss it with you all first. "We need to do two things this morning. First, I need to know what the problems are, what's slowing us down. And second, we need to figure out a solution. And we need to do it quickly; otherwise, we're going to see some new faces coming in here to handle our accounts. Tell me, honestly, do we need the help or can we get it done ourselves?" After a brief silence, one rep said, "We have some paperwork logjams and laptop problems that are slowing us down, but we can work around these problems. Look, I can't speak for everyone here but I can get mine handled without any help. And I really don't want someone else coming in and working any of my accounts. What do you guys think?" Someone responded with, "Yeah, I agree. We can do it." "Hold on," said Phil Weston. "We have more problems like administrative clerks who don't want to do their job and a sales funnel that's taking hours to deal with." "Hey, Phil, chill out, man," replied a rep. "Nobody else seems too concerned about those things." Brandon interceded, "Phil's got a right to his opinion. Remember the ground rules? I'm writing down these two additional concerns. Other comments? How about you guys who haven't said anything yet?" "I agree that's there's a lot of things slowing us down," said Lisa Browning. "But we can deal with them. The last thing I want is help from the outside." The room resounded with "I can get it done" and "We can fix it." "Okay," Brandon said. "You're telling me that we can get back on track. I have a list of four roadblocks that we can solve. Is there anyone here who has any doubts? If so, let me know now, because this is my head that's going on the chopping block if I tell my boss we can get it done by ourselves." With everyone agreed, Brandon added, "One more thing, one more very big thing. Despite the deadline pressures, I expect you to do a quality selling job on each account. We have to sell all our products and cross-sell as we normally would. No rushing through your accounts. We will not compromise our standards under any circumstance, and we'll make an honest effort to do the best we can with every customer. I might add, my tracking system will give us a daily look at the quality and quantity of sales. I guarantee you if either quality or quantity is being sacrificed, I will pull the plug immediately and bring in reinforcements. With this in mind, do I still have everyone's commitment?" The reps agreed, and Brandon continued, "Okay, it looks like we have unanimous consensus. So tell me what you're going to do to get it done, how we're going to solve the problem. I can't guarantee that my boss is going to let us finish by ourselves, but when I ask, I want a good solid game plan and I want your commitment." In an hour, the reps outlined a timetable, identified secretarial and database improvements that were needed, and established a weekly account review system that would make sure they were on track to reaching deadline. "Okay," said Brandon. "This plan looks reasonable. You guys put it together; you all are committed to it. And you are accountable for its success. I'll support you in any way I can, but when it comes down to it, each one of you are the only people who will make this work. I'll polish up the plan and take it to the boss. If he agrees to it, I will tell you this--that everyone will be watching. Your results will be tracked daily, and the pressure will be on. So you'll have to give it your best. And you'll have to keep me in the loop if there's even the smallest problem."

Background The depths of the oceans are filled with mystery: although we have mapped the entire Earth's oceans with sonar, much of the deep areas of the oceans themselves is still unexplored. Before 2019, only three people had been to the deepest point of the oceans (Challenger Deep in the Pacific Ocean, nearly 11 kilometers below sea level). In comparison, 12 people have walked on the moon (over 384 000 km away)! Despite the harsh conditions found in the depths of our oceans, human ingenuity has allowed us to explore the deepest depths of the ocean - both for the good of humanity in the form of scientific knowledge, and the detriment of humanity in the form of military exercises. One type of vehicle that can be used to dive deep into the ocean is the submarine.  Two of the most important goals of a submarine are to withstand the extreme pressures of the ocean on the outside, while maintaining the right gases in the right quantities on the inside to sustain human life. (After all, what good is a manned submarine if the people inside can't steer it?) Submarines typically have a central atmosphere control station, where sensors will analyze the atmosphere to ensure that the atmosphere is safe to breathe and make adjustments as necessary for the safety of the crew. The most important gases to control inside a submarine are oxygen and carbon dioxide. This final exam will explore some of the chemistry associated with the proper and safe functioning of submarines.

Hydronium ions come from a natural equilibrium reaction of water to produce hydronium ions (H3O+) and hydroxide ions (OH-).                          2 H2O (l)      H3O+(aq)    +     OH-(aq) Today, the pH of a solution is most conveniently done by using a pH meter which is a sophisticated instrument that uses a probe to measure the amount of hydronium ions present in a solution. However, before the advent of pH meters, chemists would use multiple pH indicators to estimate the pH. These known compounds will dissolve in aqueous solutions and change to unique colors based on the pH of the solution. A series of pH indicators are shown below in the table with the pH of the color change and the colors listed.     Use the colors of each of the indicators to estimate the pH of each of the solutions below.

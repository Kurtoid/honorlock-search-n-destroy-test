10) You are asked to design a short shaft with the factored loads of 14 kips and 120 kip-ft installed in the medium stiff clay shown below.  For the design, you are to use a resistance factor of 0.4 to assess nominal/ultimate lateral resistance.  For the design you have the option of using and either a 36 inch (Mult = 15,500 kip-inch) or 48 inch (Mult = 35,000 kip-inch) diameter shaft.  Besides the diameter, select the total length, L, of the shaft based on Broms short shaft approach.  Does the computed L meet the short shaft assumption?  Show all calculations.  (30 pts)

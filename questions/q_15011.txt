The following text is related to questions based Hands-on Testing Workshop, taught in class.  The below text is applicable to the hands-on questions below. Read the text carefully and make sure you understand the questions asked. If you can't answer one of the questions, provide a reasonable answer so that you can continue answering the questions that follow. Below questions are meant to mimic the Hands-on Testing Workshop and the same ideas, tools (since you don't have the tools, you have to imagine that you have them) and style of state diagram should be used. The model(s) must follow the same conventions we used in the workshop.  Use yed live (see link below) to draw the model. Download the graphml file and upload it as the answer to the applicable questions.  https://www.yworks.com/yed-live/ Assume you are given a simple web-based system, which is the system under test (SUT). You are also given a model generation (MG) tool as well as a test case generation (TG) tool. See comment above about how these tools work.   The SUT can perform the following 6 actions:      Description Short Name   Create customer account (account for short)  CreateAccount   Delete account  DelAccount   Add a very cheap product to the basket  AddCheap   Add a very expensive product to the basket  AddExpensive    Remove a very cheap product from the basket   RemCheap    Remove a very expensive product from the basket   RemExpensive    Note: This is a simplified web system so if there are two very expensive products in the basket the action "remove a very expensive product" will randomly pick one very expensive product and remove it. Thus, you don't need to keep track of individual products in the basket. The SUT can perform the following 7 checks:    Description Short Name   Assert that an  account exists and that the basket is empty AssertAccountBasketIsEmpty   Assert that no  account exists  AssertNoAccount    Assert that there is one very expensive product and nothing else in the basket   AssertOneExpensive    Assert that there is one very cheap product and nothing else in the basket   AssertOneCheap   Assert that there are two very cheap products and nothing else in the basket  AssertTwoCheap    Assert that there are two very expensive products and nothing else in the basket   AssertTwoExpensive    Assert that there is one very expensive product in the basket and one very cheap product in the basket   AssertCheapExpensive    Note: The following example "Assert that there is one very expensive product in the basket" means that the assert will check that only one product is in the basket AND that the product is very expensive. Thus, the assert will fail if there is no product, or if there is one product but it is a very cheap one, or if there are two products in the basket. The SUT and testing of the SUT has the following rules.  No account exists when the first test case starts running At most one account can exist at any time. An account can only have at most two products at any time A product can be added to the basket only if an account exists An account can only be deleted if the basket is empty Each test case must set up (create) and tear down (delete and remove) all necessary structures (account and products) Unless not specifically specified, testing should not violate the rules, e.g. testing should not try to remove a product that's not in the basket or delete an account that doesn't exist etc.  Your general task is to test that  The SUT works for very cheap products as well as for very expensive products and combinations of cheap and expensive products The SUT's behavior should be the same independently of the order of adding to and removing from the basket,  If the SUT doesn't work, your test case should fail near the place where the problem is using an action followed by an assert. Sample steps of an incomplete test case:  Create account  Add a very expensive product to the basket   Assert that a very expensive product is in the basket   To answer the questions, use the short names (e.g. by copying and pasting from tables above) and make the test case look like this (please note that this sample test case is still incomplete):  CreateAccount AddExpensive AssertOneExpensive

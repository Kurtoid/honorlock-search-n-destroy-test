Additional Instructions The quiz consists of 40 short answer and multiple choice questions. Each question is worth 1 point. Since the test includes short answer questions that I must grade by hand, your official test result will not be posted until later in the week. I will send out an announcement at that time. When completing the short answer questions, keep your answers concise and make sure you use course materials in backing up your answers. Let me make one last reminder about what is and is not allowed in this open-book, open-note exam. You may use your notes and your online materials related to this class. You may use Google and other online resources to help jog your memory about a particular topic. You cannot copy or share the test questions with anyone and you cannot discuss the exam with anyone until after 6pm of the exam day when the exam window is closed. Doing any of these things is an academic honor policy violation and will result in a score of 0 on the final and being reported to the University. If you have any technical issues arise during the exam that might prevent you from finishing, document them as best you can and contact me ASAP via email.

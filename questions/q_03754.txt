A roadway construction process uses a machine that pours concrete onto the roadway and measures the thickness of the concrete so the roadway will measure up to the required depth in inches. The concrete thickness needs to be consistent across the road, but the machine isn't perfect and it is costly to operate. Since there's a safety hazard if the roadway is thinner than the minimum 23 inch thickness, the company sets the machine to average 26 inches for the batches of concrete. They believe the thickness level of the machine's concrete output can be described by a Normal model with standard deviation 1.75 inches. [Show work]  a. What percent of the concrete roadway is under the minimum depth?  b. The company's lawyers insist that no more than 3% of the output be under the limit. Because of the expense of operating the machine, they cannot afford to reset the mean to a higher value. Instead they will try to reduce the standard deviation to achieve the "only 3% under" goal. What standard deviation must they attain?

Section C  Question 7 Read the following extract and answer the questions below. Your answers must be in paragraph form.                Making the transition from a learner to a student can be a scary and intimidating change, one which could best be described as a "culture shock". Teachers, parents, friends and family try their best to prepare you for this, but often the focus is more on the academic side of things, while social changes are likely to present equally daunting obstacles. Simply put, you'll go through a number of phases when attempting to acclimate to your new social environment. You may initially feel fascinated and intrigued by observing the new social structure, but romanticising this phase can quickly result in a lot of anxiety and frustration when you struggle to find your place. Then comes adjustment; the more you're exposed to this new environment, the more likely you are to familiarise yourself with the setting, learn what to expect and finally become comfortable in your new environment. You may even open yourself up to new, exciting opportunities. Your actions in this second phase, which is characterised by anxiety, are of great importance in managing your life and finding your "place". Suddenly having more responsibility, but also having more personal freedom than ever before, can be tricky, even for the smartest, most street-savvy student. Mail and Guardian, September 2013

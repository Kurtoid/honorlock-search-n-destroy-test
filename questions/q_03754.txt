A 12 oz ribeye steak (12 oz = 336 g) is to be cooked to medium term (146 degF = 62.8 degC). If the steak has a specific heat capacity of 3.10 J/gdegC and was originally refrigerated at 40.0 degF (4.44 degC), what is the minimum amount of heat required to cook the steak? Must show your work (scratch paper) to receive credit.
XYZ project organization has one workstation that is capable of generating the drawings that their clients study before accepting XYZ's bid. XYZ is currently in the midst of three proposal projects and knows exactly when it will need to use the workstation. All other work to be done, both before and after the workstation is used, is scheduled such that it flows to the workstation and keeps it busy. Resources used after this step are less critical; so while the subsequent work and resources are important, they aren't viewed with the same reverence as the workstation. This is an example of:

A particular professor likes to drink his/her coffee at a precise temperature.  But the professor is usually in a hurry.  So he/she makes a pot of concentrated coffee (95.0oC), and mixes with cold water from a refrigerator (4.0oC).  To fill his/her Thermos of 250.0 mL,  the professor mixes 130.0 mL of the concentrated coffee and 120.0 mL of cold water.  What's the professor's favorite temperature of coffee? Assume 1) the densities of water and coffee at all temperature are 1.000 g/mL. 2) specific heat capacities of concentrated coffee and water are all 4.184 J/g oC, 3) the thermos is a perfect insulator with no loss of heat. Mark your answer next to words "Final answer is". You must follow significant figure rules.  Show your work here to receive any partial credit.

Arrange the following functions so that each function is big-O of the next function (i.e. the first function is big-O of the second function, the second function is big-O of the third function, etc.) a(n) = 3nlog(n) b(n) = n!/5 c(n) = n1/2 d(n) = n10 e(n) = 10n f(n) = (log(n))4

All of the following are advantages of the PERT network EXCEPT
A Pearson product-moment correlation attempts to draw a line of best fit through the data of two variables, and the Pearson correlation coefficient, r, indicates how far away all these data points are to this line of best fit.

A small number of lizards from a mainland population have been deposited on four isolated islands because of the effects of a rare strong storm.     Which of the following best predicts the outcome of these lizards reproducing for many generations on the islands?     A) Courtship rituals specific to each island lizard species prevent the lizards from interbreeding.       B) Speciation results from bottleneck events that happened before the ancestral species reached the islands.       C) The different species that currently exist are the result of hybridization between lizards from different islands.       D) The isolation prevents gene flow; thus, the lizards on different islands experience prezygotic isolation.

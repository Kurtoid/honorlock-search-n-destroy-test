A cart in an amusement park is launched on a rollercoaster by a gigantic spring as shown in the figure above. The spring constant is 800 kN/m, (1kN/m=1000 N/m) and the initial compression of the spring is 120 cm. The mass of the cart together with the passengers is 2000 kg. Point B is at the top of a circular loop of radius 10.0 m. When the cart is reaching the top of the loop, its speed is 11.0 m/s. a) (3p) What is the initial potential energy of the compressed gigantic spring? Show work for a partial credit! b) (4p) What is the mechanical energy of the cart at point B? Show work for a partial credit! c) (4p) What is the work done by non-conservative forces during time interval the cart is moving from point A to point B? Show work for a partial credit! d) (6p) What is the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the track on the cart at point B? You must show work starting with Fnet=ma. e) (8p) If the non-conservative forces do the same amount of work when the cart is moving from point B to point C as when the cart is moving from point A to point B, what is the speed of the cart at point C? You must show work starting with one of the work-energy theorems. Answering all parts of the question, make sure to specify correct units in your final answers. Points will be taken otherwise.

Using an ex vivo cellular model of T-cell receptor (TcR) signaling, you have used CRISPR to generate a series of T-cell lines that contain mutations in the molecules listed below. You have also generated an antigen presenting cell (APC) line, which expresses all the appropriate machinery required for presentation of peptides and is fully capable of binding to and activating all aspects of TcR signaling in the parental (wildtype) version of your T-cell line. Describe the predicted phenotypes of these mutant cell lines with regards to the proximal (e.g. activation of intracellular kinases, recruitment of adapter proteins, etc) and distal TcR signaling modalities (Ca++ handling, IL-2 production, etc). Be specific and provide a rationale for your answer.    A) STIM-1 (point mutation in the Ca++ binding domain that eliminates Ca++ binding) B) Csk (entire gene deletion) C) Calcineurin (point mutation in the phosphatase domain that eliminates phosphatase activity) D) ZAP-70 (entire gene deletion)

Employer-based health insurance  1. As discussed during lecture, in the early 1940s the U.S. faced a severe labor shortage with so many working-age individuals serving in the military . Federal economists at that time feared that businesses would keep raising salaries to compete for workers and that inflation would spiral out of control. To stop this from happening, a decision was made and President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9250, establishing the Office of Economic Stabilization. This action is what led to frozen wages. Businesses quickly figured out that providing benefits was the way to compete for workers and providing generous health care insurance worked.  Then, in 1943, a prominent federal financial agency made a decision about employer-based health insurance.  1. What were this game-changing decision and the federal agency that executed on this decision? After these two decisions were made, and due to the unions applying the collective bargaining process, unions were able to raise the level of benefits received by employees as well as the share of benefits in total compensation. 2. What happened between 1940 and 1960 in terms of employer-sponsored health insurance? Think critically about the effects of this rapidly expanding employer-sponsored health insurance. During the 1950s and late 1960s, the economy was booming, and industry was more than happy to provide health care. The employees might have a concern. 3. Explain a negative effect that was had on employees at that time, either in relation to changing jobs or turning 65.

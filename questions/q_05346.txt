Dispatch: You are called to University Center Club for a patient who is 7.5 months pregnant and thinks she is experiencing contractions.   Background Information: Upon arrival, you ensured the scene was safe and donned the appropriate PPE. You introduced yourself to the female who is laying down on a couch in the lounge area and shares that she thinks she started experiencing contractions during dinner 30 minutes ago. So far, you have gathered the following information about your patient - she is alert, she is breathing at a slightly rapid rate, breaths are of adequate depth and appear to be unlabored, and her pulse is present in her radial artery. You don't observe any apparent trauma to the patient. Additional Information: Let's say you complete your primary assessment and determine that patient is a low priority based on your assessment that there are currently no existing or potential threats to her ABC's. You determine she is a stable medical patient at this time.   Q: Consider some of the questions you would reasonably need to ask this patient to get a better history about her chief complaint. List 4 of those questions below, along with a brief description (1-2 sentences) next to each indicating how the information gathered could affect your overall assessment. For example, if your question was "How high was the tree branch you fell from?", the description could be something like "whether or not the height of the fall was >10 ft for the child would determine if the MOI was significant or not".

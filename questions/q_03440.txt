The CCR5D32 variant at the CCR5 locus is a well-studied example of natural selection acting in humans. It is found principally in Europe and western Asia, with higher frequencies generally in the north. CCR5D32 homozygotes are resistant to HIV-1 infection because the variant prevents functional expression of the CCR5 chemokine receptor normally used by HIV-1 to enter CD4+ T cells. The map depicts the geographic spread of the CCR5D32 allele. Which of the following options best describes the diffusion of this allele across Europe and why the HIV epidemic of sub-Saharan Africa is unlikely to lead to an increase in the CCR5D32 allele over the short term?

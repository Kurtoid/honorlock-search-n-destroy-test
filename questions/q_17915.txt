Write a static method called tallyScores that takes as a parameter a Scanner containing a series of student records and that prints a summary of each student record. A student record will begin with a name followed by a sequence of integer test scores. The name is guaranteed to be one word composed of letters. You may assume that each student has at least one test score. Your method should produce two lines of output for each student: one showing the student's name and test scores and a second line showing the average score. For example, if a Scanner called records contains the following:  John 71 83 94 Sally 94 85 Fred 90 95 82 85 and the following call is made:  tallyScores(records); the following output should be produced:  John: 71 83 94 average = 82.66666666666667 Sally: 94 85 average = 89.5 Fred: 90 95 82 85 average = 88.0 You are to exactly reproduce the format of this output. Notice that line breaks in the input are not meaningful and that the average is not rounded. You may not construct any extra data structures to solve this problem.

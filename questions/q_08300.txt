Methyl bromide (CH3Br) will react with potassium hydroxide to give the corresponding alcohol methanol (CH3OH) and potassium bromide salt.  The kinetics for the reaction are known to be first order with respect to CH3Br.  Data for an initial rates kinetic experiment are below.  The density of the 20% by wt. solution of KOH (MW 56.1g/mol) is 1.185 g/mL.   What is the order with respect to KOH?     CH3Br + KOH --> CH3OH + KBr     Trial   Vol 20% KOH (mL)   Vol final (mL)   initial [CH3Br] (M)   Initial Rate      A   0.5   10   0.0045   -3.12x10-4     B   1.0   10   0.0045   -5.94x10-4

58.  The form of analgesia that is placed on the tissue in preparation for an injection is termed:
(25 points, 25 mins) A cylindrical water heating element consists of an inner rod (k = 5 W/m*K, r = 8 mm) that produces heat, surrounded by a protective sheath of outer radius 11 mm and k = 15 W/m*K. There is no gap between the rod and the sheath. The outer surface temperature of the sheath is 175degC, and the water being heated is at 30degC, with h = 1500 W/m2K.  Calculate: A. The temperature at the inner surface of the sheath (same as the outer temperature of the rod.) B. The temperature at the center of the heat generating rod.

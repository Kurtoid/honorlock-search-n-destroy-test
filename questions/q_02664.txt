OEDIPUSYe pray; 'tis well, but would ye hear my wordsAnd heed them and apply the remedy,Ye might perchance find comfort and relief.Mind you, I speak as one who comes a strangerTo this report, no less than to the crime;For how unaided could I track it farWithout a clue? Which lacking (for too lateWas I enrolled a citizen of Thebes)This proclamation I address to all:--Thebans, if any knows the man by whomLaius, son of Labdacus, was slain,I summon him to make clean shrift to me.And if he shrinks, let him reflect that thusConfessing he shall 'scape the capital charge;For the worst penalty that shall befall himIs banishment--unscathed he shall depart.But if an alien from a foreign landBe known to any as the murderer,Let him who knows speak out, and he shall haveDue recompense from me and thanks to boot.But if ye still keep silence, if through fearFor self or friends ye disregard my hest,Hear what I then resolve; I lay my banOn the assassin whosoe'er he be.Let no man in this land, whereof I holdThe sovereign rule, harbor or speak to him;Give him no part in prayer or sacrificeOr lustral rites, but hound him from your homes.For this is our defilement, so the godHath lately shown to me by oracles.Thus as their champion I maintain the causeBoth of the god and of the murdered King.And on the murderer this curse I lay(On him and all the partners in his guilt):--Wretch, may he pine in utter wretchedness!And for myself, if with my privityHe gain admittance to my hearth, I prayThe curse I laid on others fall on me.See that ye give effect to all my hest,For my sake and the god's and for our land,A desert blasted by the wrath of heaven.For, let alone the god's express command,It were a scandal ye should leave unpurgedThe murder of a great man and your king,Nor track it home. And now that I am lord,Successor to his throne, his bed, his wife,(And had he not been frustrate in the hopeOf issue, common children of one wombHad forced a closer bond twixt him and me,But Fate swooped down upon him), therefore IHis blood-avenger will maintain his causeAs though he were my sire, and leave no stoneUnturned to track the assassin or avengeThe son of Labdacus, of Polydore,Of Cadmus, and Agenor first of the race.And for the disobedient thus I pray:May the gods send them neither timely fruitsOf earth, nor teeming increase of the womb,But may they waste and pine, as now they waste,Aye and worse stricken; but to all of you,My loyal subjects who approve my acts,May Justice, our ally, and all the godsBe gracious and attend you evermore.

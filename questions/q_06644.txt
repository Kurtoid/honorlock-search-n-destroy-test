You calculate the price of the call at each node using the formula callnode = (p*callup + (1-p)*calldown) / (1+r) ..... You are an expert by now. At one of the nodes, you realize that the intrinsic value of the call [MAX(Stock-Strike,0)] is higher than the call price you have estimated before. Given that the option is American, you go ahead and...

A 20 kg object moving on a frictionless surface with an initial velocity of 15.0 m/s in the positive x-direction. The object strikes and sticks to a 30 kg object moving with an initial velocity of 10.0 m/s moving in the same direction on the same surface.    The 20 kg object emits sound at a frequency of 500 Hz. What frequency does the 30 kg object observe just prior to the collision? (Speed of sound is 343 m/s) What is the final velocity of the objects? How much kinetic energy is lost in this collision? The objects cross onto a rough surface with a coefficient of friction of 0.2. How much distance do the objects travel before coming to a complete stop?

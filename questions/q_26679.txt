Fig. 5(a) shows a static logic circuit containing 5 gates (including the inverter). Assume (a) the probability of assigning a logic 1 to each primary input is 0.5, (b) the load capacitances of gates X, Y, Z are C1, C2, C3 respectively, (c) the circuit operates with frequency f, and the power supply is Vdd.      (a) Calculate the dynamic power consumption for output loads (i.e., C1, C2, and C3) of gates X, Y, and Z using Equation 1 shown in Figure 5(b). (b) Calculate the short-circuit power consumption using Equation 2 for gates X, Y, and Z by assuming input slop tau for each gate. (c) Repeat (a) but the input probabilities are changed to P(a=1) = 0.3 and P(b=1) = 0.9. (d) Repeat (b) but the input probabilities are changed to P(a=1) = 0.3 and P(b=1) = 0.9.

Pearl comes from a culture where you are born with exactly one purpose in life, and consequently one acceptable goal you can pursue. In her case, she was born to be a servant to royalty. In her culture, it is absolutely unacceptable to "be yourself" if doing so means stepping outside of your preassigned social role. As such, Pearl cannot express her true emotions or follow her dream of becoming a skilled engineer. Instead, she must act in a way that is appropriate for people of her station. Pearl's culture is ___________.

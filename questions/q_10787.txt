When the following equation is balanced, what is the coefficient for H2O?Ca(OH)2 (aq) + H3PO4 (aq) - Ca3(PO4)2(s) + H2O(l)
The order Hymenoptera includes:
An amino acid can never exist as an uncharged compound, regardless of the pH of the solution. To be uncharged, an amino acid would have to lose a proton from an +NH3 group with a pKa of about 9 before it would lose a proton from a COOH group with a pKa of about 2. Therefore, at physiological pH (7.4), an amino acid exists as a dipolar ion, called a zwitterion. With another acidic or basic functional group, there may be more ions.        Choose the accurate zwitterion form of the amino acid above as it exists at physiological pH (7.4).

10) Are wealthier people happier? A research study made by Northern Illinois University College of Education used an existing data set with 959 participants in the New York City. Simple linear regression analysis is applied to confirm the association between income and happiness. The study shows that there is statistically significant correlation between income and happiness, however, the relationship is really weak. The equation of happiness and income is:  Yhappiness = 3.567 + 0.306 * income + 0.86.   Select the following statements which you believe to be true:

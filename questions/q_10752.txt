The hospital food service tells the dietician that the dinner for today is salmon steak, baked eggs, and acorn squash.

Find the augmented matrix of the corresponding linear system that solves for x (amount of salmon steak), y (amount of baked eggs), and z (amount of acorn squash).

You can use any calculator or there is a scientific calculator in the browser. Note that you cannot print out the periodic table or equation page during the exam. Problems are "locked down" meaning you can only go forward to the next question, not back to the previous one. If you realize you made a mistake on a previous question, you'll have a chance to correct one problem (and only one) in the last question of the exam. So keep notes in your work as to which question number and the change you want to make if you realize you made an error. Be careful and don't second guess your first instincts so you do not change a correct answer to an incorrect one. If you try to make more than one correction, I'll only grade the first one. Calculation type problems are at the end and have higher point values than some of the earlier conceptual type problems. Partial credit is possible on many of these problems. Make sure you have paper and pencil so you can show your work. This will also allow me to give you credit on certain problems if your answer was correct but marked wrong because you used incorrect sig figs, for example. After you finish the exam, you must upload a scan (pdf file) of your work within 15 minutes. Be ready to do this (but no phones, etc. allowed during the exam)! Many of the questions will ask you to show your work on paper to receive full credit. Write your name on every page. You must label the work for each question that requires work using the question number and circle your answer. Don't cram this into a small space - spread it out and make it easily readable for Dr Sue. On your work, don't forget to use correct sig figs and put units on every number and each answer. There will be a penalty up to zero points for these problems if you do not upload of work that supports your answer. Some of the problems require manual grading therefore no score will be shown when you finish! I may decide to curve the results or alter question points if necessary.

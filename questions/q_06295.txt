Directions:  Conjugate the verb in parentheses to make a complete sentence about someone's routines. Make sure to make the reflexive verbs agree (pronoun and ending), and be careful that the words ne pas are correctly placed when they appear. ATTENTION!

If you type nothing, I will assume that there are no accents on your conjugated verb. Richard ______________________ (s'habiller /ne pas) tres rapidement, donc il est en retard.

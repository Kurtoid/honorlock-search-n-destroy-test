Question 11 - 13 refers to the excerpt below. "[W]e must, by means of a rapid and sustained build-up of the political, economic, and military strength of the free world, and by means of an affirmative program intended to wrest the initiative from the Soviet Union, confront it with convincing evidence of the determination and ability of the free world to frustrate the Kremlin design of a world dominated by its will. Such evidence is the only means short of war which eventually may force the Kremlin to abandon its present course of action and to negotiate acceptable agreements on issues of major importance. "The whole success of the proposed program hangs ultimately on recognition by this Government, the American people, and all free peoples, that the cold war is in fact a real war in which the survival of the free world is at stake.... The prosecution of the program will require of us all the ingenuity, sacrifice, and unity demanded by the vital importance of the issue and the tenacity to persevere until our national objectives have been attained." NSC-68: United States Objectives and Programs for National Security, 1950   Question: Which of the following United States actions most directly resulted from the goals expressed in the excerpt?
White-box testing:  Consider the problem of making n cents change with quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies using the least total number of coins. Assume that the supply of each denomination is large enough to satisfy every request for change. Suppose that for a given currency, the array C[0,...,r1] represents the values of the denominations of coins, where C[0] > C[1] > ... > C[r1], and r is the number of types of denominations. For example, for US coins, you have quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, and thus C = [25, 10, 5, 1] Let the array N[0,...,r1] be the output. It represents the number of coins for the corresponding denominations to be dispensed. If you had to make change for n=41, then the array N =[1,1,1,1]. The following code implements a greedy algorithm for making change. 0.    r = 4; 1.    C = {25, 10, 5, 1}; 2.    N = {0, 0, 0, 0}; 3.    read (n); 4a.  for (i = 0;             4b. i= C[i]) { 6.                      N[i] = N[i] + 1; 7.                      n = n - C[i]; 8.         } 9. }     Draw a control-flow graph of the above program. Label the nodes so that it is clear what statement(s) each node represents. Label the edges in a branch with True or False annotations. [15 points]   Consider a test input where n = 0. Identify from the control-flow graph which nodes and edges are executed and list them. [5 points]   Write additional test inputs to cover the remaining nodes and edges. For each test input, list only the new nodes and edges that are covered with each test. If you feel that a certain edge cannot be covered (i.e., the edge is infeasible), please provide an explanation. [5 points]

Suppose the dollar exchange rates of the euro and the yen are equally variable. The Yen, however, tends to depreciate unexpectedly against the dollar when the return on the rest of your wealth is unexpectedly high, while the Euro tends to appreciate unexpectedly in the same circumstances. As a U.S. resident, which currency, the euro or the yen, would you consider riskier? Justify your answer.

Question 1.1: Assume that GM's production possibilities frontier (PPF) is the following:  Suppose that the relative price of components was (PC/PR)^A in the U.S. in the absence of offshoring. Suppose now that GM has the option to offshore some of its production to other countries and that component production is relatively cheaper in the rest of the world so that(PC/PR)^W < (PC/PR)^AWhich of the following options shows correctly how offshoring affects GM's own production of components and R&D?  a)b)  c)d)
A client responds by opening his eyes upon request. The client does not know where he is, but asks appropriate questions. He pushes the examiner's hand away during carotid pulse examination. What range best exemplifies the client's Glasgow Coma Score? Write number only in the answer box.            EYE RESPONSE:* Spontaneous - Open before stimulus (+4) * To Sound - After spoken request (+3)* To Pressure - After fingertip stimulus (+2)* None - No opening at any time, no interfering factor (+1)VERBAL RESPONSE:* Oriented - Correctly gives name, place, and date (+5)* Confused - Not oriented but communicates coherently (+4)* Words - Intelligible single words (+3)* Sounds - Only moan/groans (+2)* None - No audible response - with no interfering factor (+1)MOTOR RESPONSE:* Obeys Commands - two-part request (+6)* Localizing - Brings hand above clavicle to stimulus on head/neck (+5)* Normal Flexion - Bends arm at elbow rapidly but not predominantly abnormal (+4)* Abnormal flexion - Bends arm at elbow, clearly predominantly abnormal (+3)* Extension - Extends arm at elbow, clearly abnormal (+2)* None - No movement in arms/legs, no interfering factor (+1)

Various terms can be used to describe character development in literature. When a character is two-dimensional, that character is known as ________. When a character is three-dimensional, that character is known as ________.
An experiment was done with potatoes.  Some were were at room temperature, some were placed in a warm water bath, and some were placed in a boiling water bath. A substrate was added to each tube that interacted with an enzyme in the potatoes.  The reaction was rated from 0-5, with 5 being the highest. Room temperature had a reaction rated at 3. Warm water bath had a reaction rated at 4. Boiling water bath had a reaction rated at 0. Please explain:  why the amount of reaction increased in warm water why the reaction stopped in boiling water
The following gene interactions are observed in mice. The albino allele (a), when homozygous, eliminates all color (regardless of genotype at other pigment genes).   The agouti allele (b) is recessive to the normal Brown allele (B). The phenotype of a mouse of genotype AaBb will be _______.
Use the factor-label method to solve the following stoichiometry problem.   Given the following equation: 1 C3H8  +  5 O2    3 CO2  +  4 H2O How many molecules of oxygen are required to react with 25.4 grams of C3H8? To receive full credit:  You must use the factor unit method and the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the stoichiometric calculation.  Show your work (conversion factors/and units) by using the equation editor() in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use   to insert conversion factors. Be sure to include proper units and the final answer! Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

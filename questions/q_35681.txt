Suppose there are two types of buyers (i.e., high-type and low-type customers) that differ in their willingness to pay for two different versions of a statistical software (i.e., Full Version and Scaled-Down Version). These customers appear in equal proportions in the population (for simplicity, assume there is one of each). Consumers purchase at most one unit of one of the versions, provided that the price does not exceed the maximum willingness to pay for the good. When making a decision about which of the two versions to buy, they compare consumer surplus from consumption and choose the version that gives greater surplus (any indifference is broken in favor of the Full Version). The following table presents the maximum willingness to pay for different types of goods by customer type:       Full Version Scaled-Down Version   High-Type $70 $45   Low-Type $45 $35      For simplicity assume there are no costs. Please answer below the following three questions: (a) (7 points) Suppose that the firm can identify the type of a customer. Find profits under first degree price discrimination (i.e., personalized pricing). Explain or justify your answer. (b) (6 points) Suppose that the firm cannot identify the type of a customer. What would be the optimal price charged by the firm and the total profit raised by the firm under uniform non-discriminatory pricing selling the Full Version only? Explain or justify your answer. (c) (7 points) Continue to assume that the firm cannot identify the type of a customer. Find profits under an optimal menu (second degree price discrimination). Explain or justify your answer.

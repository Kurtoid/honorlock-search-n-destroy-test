The energy of the hydrogen atom in the ground state (n = l) is 2.18x10-18 J. A particle strikes a hydrogen atom and excites the electron to its 4th energy level (n = 4) with energy of 1.36x10-19 J. If the electron returns to the ground state in one step,  the energy of the photon emitted  is [answer1] x 10[answer2] . [?]E = RH(1/m2  - 1/n2) Both m and n represent different shells. RH = 2.18 x 10-18 J/photon

Some children wet the bed well past the age where they are "potty trained."  Some clinicians and scientists have discovered that in these children, there may be dysregulation of mechanisms regulating urine production during sleep.  For most, urine volume is decreased while we sleep.  So, for children whose bodies don't automatically regulate this well, they create too much volume, which fills their bladder during the night and initiates the micturition reflex.   In these children a nasal spray has been developed to help prevent bed wetting at night (woohoo).  What do you think is in this nasal spray?

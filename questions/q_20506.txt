The primary care pediatric nurse practitioner is counseling the parents of a toddler about appropriate discipline. The parents report that the child is very active and curious, and they are worried about the potential for injury. What will the pediatric nurse practitioner recommend? correct answer: Allow the child to explore and experiment while providing appropriate limits. The child who is securely attached uses the parents as a base from which to safely explore the world. Toddlers learn by doing and need to experiment to gain mastery over the environment. It is important that parents are present for safety, but parents should not be ever-present and controlling. Parents should be close by and should intervene if the child is at risk for injury. Continual criticism and the use of the word "no" can make the toddler feel powerless.

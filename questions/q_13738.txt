It was shown that when an acid chloride is exposed to water it produces a hydrolysis reaction that results in the formation of HCl and a neutral organic product.  a)  True or False.  It was suggested that this hydrolysis reaction is an example of a SN2 reaction.  (Type in T or F only)[TF]   b) Based on the above information and reaction type, what would be an accurate name of the neutral organic product if acetyl chloride (the acid chloride of acetic acid) was exposed to ammonia, instead of water?

Which of the following researcher is correctly matched to their discovery?
Johnny (2021-02-25-SAR-Johnny-final-report-redacted-1.pdf  )   Johnny died in hospital in January 2018. He was 67 years of age. He had complex physical and mental health needs. He was entitled to Section 117 Mental Health Act aftercare having previously been detained under that Act. He had been supported to live as independently as possible in his own property which was situated in a neighbouring local authority area. When these arrangements came under strain he began to be repeatedly admitted to hospital until he agreed to a nursing home placement in the Manchester City Council area a little over a year prior to his death. Johnny never settled in this placement and repeatedly asked to leave. Opportunities to review his placement were not taken and in the months prior to his death, several safeguarding concerns were raised. The then Manchester Safeguarding Adults Board (now Manchester Safeguarding Partnership) decided to undertake a safeguarding adults review (SAR) on the grounds that neglect may have been a contributory factor in Johnny's death and there were concerns that partner agencies could have worked together more effectively to protect Johnny.   Choose and answer TWO of the following questions (please remember to clearly indicate which questions you have chosen):   Evaluate the extent to which the principles of adult safeguarding were applied in Johnny's case.   Analyse and discuss the issues that were raised as a result of Johnny being placed in out of area residential care.  Evaluate the effectiveness of multi-agency working in Johnny's case.  Choose one of the key agencies involved in Johnny's case. What is your analysis of their role in general and within this SAR?

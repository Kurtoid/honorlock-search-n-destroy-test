Obviously, Japan feels that this issue is momentous for the sake of humanity and the peace of the world. Of the non-white countries, Japan has taken the lead in adopting the best parts of European civilization. Japan codified her laws, and reformed her police and judicial systems, her military and naval forces, thus placing herself almost on an equal footing with that of the European countries.

You may assume that the tuples will always contain four strings.  Example output: >>> recipes = [("milk", "mocha syrup", "espresso", "hot"), ("chai", "cinnamon", "almond milk", "hot"),("whipped cream", "espresso", "chocolate", "cold")]>>> preference = "cold">>> print(surpriseMe(recipes, preference))[("whipped cream", "espresso", "chocolate", "cold")]

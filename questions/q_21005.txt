Following a democratic revolution in Ruritania, the new leadership discovered that the former dictator and his family had used the state-owned airline for nefarious smuggling.  The airline would bring illegal drugs into the United States and take out weapons that would be resold to guerrillas operating in Central and South America.  A grand jury investigation is under way in the United States, and there is talk of the U.S. government seizing all airline assets U.S. authorities can reach.  The new government in Ruritania believes that the evidence will show that the former dictator had personal knowledge of the smuggling, but that the crew and employees of the airline knew only that the plane carried specially sealed containers that they were enjoined not to inspect nor ask questions about.

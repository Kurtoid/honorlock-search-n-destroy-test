15. Chapter 5 discusses the most important factors that explain what makes someone -- you, for instance -- attracted to another individual. This question is going to ask which one below relates to Donn Byrne's phantom-other technique? According to Byrne's technique, subjects are asked to inspect a questionnaire supposedly filled out by another person, but the experimenter has filled out the questionnaire, so it will be similar or dissimilar to the subject's own attitudes and beliefs on a variety of issues. When subjects are asked to indicate how much they like the phantom-other, a greater liking is consistently expressed for those who agree with the subject's opinions.  So, which one of the following relates to the phantom-other technique>

Physician who studies and treats tumors
8. Bear gallbladder is used in Chinese medicine to treat inflammation.  Due to the difficulty of obtaining bear gallbladder, Chinese medical researchers are searching for a more readily available source.  A study in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology (June 1995) examined pig gallbladder as an effective substitute for bear gallbladder.  Twenty male mice were divided randomly into two groups:  10 were given a dosage bear bile and 10 were given a dosage of pig bile.  All the mice then received an injection of croton oil in the left ear lobe to induce inflammation.  Four hours later, both the left and right ear lobes were weighed, with the difference (in milligrams) representing the degree of swelling.  Summary statistics are provided below: Bear Bile:       n = 10       sample mean = 9.19       s = 4.17 Pig Bile:       n = 10       sample mean = 9.71       s = 3.33 Assume that the populations of the difference of swelling for bear bile and pig bile ears are normally distributed. Construct and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the population mean degree of swelling of mice treated with bear bile and mice treated with pig bile. (d)  Interpret the 95% confidence interval for the difference between the population mean degree of swelling of mice treated with bear bile and mice treated with pig bile.

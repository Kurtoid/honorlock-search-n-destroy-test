You will use this problem for Questions 10 and 11 and a BONUS question.  Read carefully!   A block slides from rest down a frictionless ramp, where it then encounters a flat rough floor, mk = 0.55, as shown in the diagram below.  Q10: How fast is the block traveling when it reaches point A at the bottom of the ramp? Q11:  How much work is done by friction to bring the block to a stop? (BONUS) How far across the rough floor does it travel before coming to a stop? For this question, enter the answer to Q11.

In a cross of several Mexican hairless dogs with genotypes Hh, where hairless phenotype is dominant (H) and hairy phenotype is recessive, breeders obtain the following offspring: 85 puppies, 45 hairless, 40 hairy. If you apply a chi-square test to determine if the trait is Mendelian or not, What is the expected value for each phenotype?  (value with 2 decimals) expected hairy [hairy] expected hairless [hairless] what would be your CALCULATED chi-square value? (value with 2 decimals) [chivalue]   With a critical chi square value of 3.84 (with one degree of freedom and p=0.05), would you conclude your trait is Mendelian? choose from the following options and paste the answer in the blank Yes, because the observed is significantly different from the expected. No, because the observed is significantly different from the expected. Yes,  because the observed is not significantly different from the expected. No, because the observed is not significantly different from the expected. [mendelian]

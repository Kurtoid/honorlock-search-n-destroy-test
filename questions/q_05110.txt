9) Danny is the head coach for a high school rowing team (8 rowers on a boat). At the end of every practice, the team has to row a set distance, from one dock to another.  Danny always tells the team to try as hard as they can. Usually, it takes the team 1 minute to row this set distance from dock to dock. Danny would like his team to row faster.  He buys a device that can automatically measure the force that is being applied by each of the 8 rowers individually. He tells the team members that he'll be keeping track of each of them individually and if anyone isn't rowing as hard as they can, they'll be penalized.  That day the team finishes the set distance in a new record, 50 seconds.The fact that the team rowed faster once Danny could measure each rower's effort individually is consistent with what phenomenon?

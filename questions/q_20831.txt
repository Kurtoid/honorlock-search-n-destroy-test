A college entrance exam company determined that a score of 21 on the mathematics portion of the exam suggests that a student is ready for  college-level mathematics. To achieve this  goal, the company recommends that students take a core curriculum of math courses in high school. Suppose a random sample of 200 students who completed this core set of courses results in a mean math score of 21.4 on the college entrance exam with a standard deviation of 4.2. Using a 0.05 level of significance, do these results suggest that students who complete the core curriculum are ready for  college-level mathematics? That  is, are they scoring above 21 on the math portion of the  exam?  List the hypotheses, the critical value(s), the test value (test statistic) and briefly (1-2 sentences) explain why the results do or do not suggest that students who complete the core curriculum are ready for college-level mathematics.

Police obtained a warrant to arrest Rolen and two co-conspirators for illegal weapons sales at his workplace, Ron"s Convenience Store. A team of four officers observed the store long enough to see two people enter the store and two other people exit the store. The officers then stepped through the front door into the store, and found Rolen inside, along with one other person. Two officers placed handcuffs on Rolen, who was standing behind the sales counter at the front. Two other officers went down a set of stairs at the back of the store. There was no door at the top or bottom of the stairs. The officers entered a basement area at the bottom of the stairs and crossed the room. They saw nobody in the basement, but noticed some crates sitting against the far wall of the basement, about twenty feet away. They walked across the room and saw illegal weapons sitting on the crates, behind some cans of paint. Can the government introduce those weapons into evidence at Rolen"s trial?

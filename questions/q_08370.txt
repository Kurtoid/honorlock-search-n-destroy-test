A second year doctoral student is performing her rotation in a muscle physiology laboratory. She is very talented in biochemistry and biophysics techniques. Thus, she decides to test the role of specific sarcomeric/myofibrillar proteins on muscle contractile properties. In experiment #1, she performs a troponin exchange experiment. She isolates a type II (fast twitch) muscle fiber and tests the force-calcium relationship and force-velocity relationship. Then, she uses a protocol to replace troponin C in the fast fiber with a troponin C found in type I (slow isoform) and repeats the tests. In experiment #2, she creates a 'mutant' type I fiber that contains a 'fast twitch' type of myosin regulatory light chain to compare with native (normal) type I fiber. She then performs tests of force-calcium and force-velocity relationship in the mutant and native fibers. Based on what you have read and learned in class, what are reasonable expectations for the results of these two experiments?

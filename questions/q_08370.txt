QUESTION 6     A force of 140 N is applied to pull a box with a mass of 40kg, to the right across a floor, as illustrated in the diagram below. The force makes an angle of 47deg to the horizontal. The box experiences a constant frictional force.     Right click on the blue button, to open the diagrams in a new tab.                  6.1   Calculate the acceleration of the box if friction is ignored.   (4)     6.2   Now calculate the acceleration of the box if it experiences a frictional force of 28 N.   (4)              [8]

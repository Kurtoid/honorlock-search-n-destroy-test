A block of 10 kg rests on the (horizontal) floor. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the floor is 0.1. You push horizontally on the block with a force F = 20 N. a) What is the work done on the block by the force F after the block has moved a distance d = 2 m (in the same direction of the force on the floor). [parta] b) What is the increase of the kinetic energy of the box after it has traveled a distance d = 2m?  [partb] c) Suppose F is still 20 N but is now angled at 15 deg downward. Is the work done by F in moving the block through a distance d = 2 m (on the floor) smaller or larger than the work done when F is horizontal? [partc]

Boning Up Against Breast Cancer: How It Can Alter Its Structure to Help It Spread Karla Lant, the Science Times A team of scientists from the University of Sheffield and University of Copenhagen have discovered an enzyme which helps breast cancer spread, and in the process, have found a possible way to prevent the spread of breast cancer-secondary or metastatic cancer-in patients. Bones are the most common routes breast cancer takes as it spreads, involved in about 85 percent of secondary breast cancer cases. The work took place in London at the Institute of Cancer Research. The team discovered the primary tumor releases the enzyme LysYl Oxidase (LOX) which causes holes in bone. This is how the cancer prepares for more cancer cells, creating a home for them in the holey bones. According to team leader Dr. Alison Gartland of the Department of Human Metabolism at the University of Sheffield, "This is important progress in the fight against breast cancer metastasis and these findings could lead to new treatments to stop secondary breast tumors growing in the bone, increasing the chances of survival for thousands of patients." The researchers believe that early detection of LOX in estrogen receptor negative (ER negative) patients will allow doctors to block its action, preventing damage to the bones and metastasis. The team also proved that treatment with an existing class of osteoporosis drug, bisphosphonate, can prevent the changes. This treatment prevented breast cancer from spreading in mice. Dr. Gartland believes this important research may provide cancer patients with a better prognosis over the long term. "We are really excited about our results that show breast cancer tumors send out signals to destroy the bone before cancer cells get there in order to prepare the bone for the cancer cells' arrival. The next step is to find out exactly how the tumor secreted LOX interacts with bone cells to be able to develop new drugs to stop the formation of the bone lesions and cancer metastasis. This could also have implications for how we treat other bone diseases too." Study co-leader Dr. Janine Erler of the Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC) at the University of Copenhagen, said, "Once cancer spreads to the bone it is very difficult to treat. Our research has shed light on the way breast cancer cells prime the bone so it is ready for their arrival. If we were able to block this process and translate our work to the clinic, we could stop breast cancer in its tracks thereby extending patients' lives." Senior Research Communications Manager Katherine Woods of Breast Cancer Campaign and Breakthrough Breast Cancer said, "By unveiling the role that the protein LOX is playing, these results open up a whole new avenue for research and treatments that could stop breast cancer spreading to the bone. The research also adds weight to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of bisphosphonates in stopping secondary breast cancer in its tracks. The reality of living with secondary breast cancer in the bone is a stark one, which leaves many women with bone pain and fractures that need extensive surgery just when they need to be making the most of the time they have left with friends and family." The research was published this week in the journal Nature.        The diagram above suggests that the enzyme LOX may causes holes in bone tissue through X cells. What could be the X cells?

You run a business that will supply natural gas to customers in Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, and Pensacola from distribution centers (DCs). You have three candidate DC locations to choose from (Gainesville, Lake City, and Tallahassee). Each DC has a capacity restriction that limits the number of units of gas it can supply. Each customer city has a demand that should be satisfied. Develop a single integer linear programming formulation that (when solved) will determine which DC locations to open and allocate DC capacity to the customers so as to minimize total distribution costs plus the fixed cost of the facilities that are opened. The per unit cost of distributing one unit of natural gas from each DC to each customer is shown in the table below, along with the demand and capacity levels. The fixed costs of operating DC's (if opened) in Gainesville, Lake City, and Tallahassee are $3000, $4500, and $4000, respectively. [Do not solve the problem. Just provide the formulation without any attempt to reduce complexity by solving (or partially solving) the problem.].

SCENARIO 6:                         A patient, Ms. Stokes, arrives to the radiology department from the emergency room with injuries to the base of her vertebral column that radiates toward the left side. A 3-view sacrum and coccyx examination and an anterior view of the sacroiliac joints are ordered comprised of AP Axial Sacrum, AP Axial Coccyx, Left Lateral Sacrum and Coccyx views as well as an AP Axial Sacroiliac joints view.

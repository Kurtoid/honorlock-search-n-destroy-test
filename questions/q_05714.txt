Consider the following C code.  Assume that x, y, and any array you declare are aligned on a 32 byte boundary.  Note 128 is an integer multiple of 8.  Use AVX intrinsics to transform the code to improve performance while still producing the same results.  You may find the AVX prototypes in the table useful for this problem. float sum, x[128], y[128];sum = 0.0;for (i = 0; i < 128; i++)   sum += x[i] * 2.0 + y[i];    Prototype Explanation   __m256 _mm256_load_ps(float *p); Loads 8 FP values from the p address and returns the 4 values as one __m256 value.   void _mm256_store_ps(float *p, __m256 v); Stores the __m256 value in v at the address specified in p.   __m256 _m256_add_ps(__m256 a, __m256 b); Returns the sum of __m256 values in a and b.   __m256 _m256_mul_ps(__m256 a, __m256 b); Returns the product of __m256 values in a and b.   __m256 _mm256_set_ps(float v1, ..., float v8); Takes eight scalar values as input and constructs and returns one __m256 value.

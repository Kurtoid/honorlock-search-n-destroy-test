Finding the Longest Palindrome Subsequence  Implement a function longestPalindromeSubseq function that returns a string that is the longest palindromic subsequence in a give input string s. [14 points]  The longestPalindromeSubseq has the following one parameter;   s: non-empty input string   The return value of the longestPalindromeSubseq;  the longest palindromic subsequence  If there are multiple subsequences of the equal length, then return the subsequence which is the smallest in lexicographic order           Explain the run-time and run-space complexity of the algorithm that you used for the implementation. [6 points]  Description Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence in s. When there are multiple subsequences which have the same length, return the subsequence which is the smallest in lexicographic order. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.  Sample Input  s : "bbbab"  Expected output for the sample input above  "bbbb"

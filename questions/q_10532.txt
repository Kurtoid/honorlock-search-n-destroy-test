"The Australian nation is another case of a great civilization supplanting a lower race unable to make full use of the land and its resources. The struggle means suffering, intense suffering, while it is in progress; but that struggle and that suffering have been the stages by which the White man has reached his present stage of development, and they account for the fact that he no longer lives in caves and feeds on roots and nuts. This dependence of progress on the survival of the fitter race, terribly harsh as it may seem to some of you, gives the struggle for existence its redeeming features; it is the fiery crucible out of which comes the finer metal."

An electronics store and a manufacturer of gaming computers entered into a written contract whereby the manufacturer would sell to the electronics store 25 of its top-of-the-line gaming computers for $1,000 each. When the delivery arrived several days early, on July 15, the electronics store noticed that the computers did not have all of the features as the top-of-the-line model that was ordered. The electronics store notified the manufacturer that it was rejecting the computers that were delivered and expected the manufacturer to send 25 top-of-the-line models immediately. The manufacturer replied that because of a backlog of orders that had not yet been filled, the top-of-the- line models could not be delivered until October 15. Because the electronics store had contracted with a local college to deliver 10 top-of-the-line models for use by the college's varsity esports program by July 31, the electronics store delivered 10 of the nonconforming gaming computers to the college along with a promise to replace them with 10 top-of-the-line models in mid-October. The electronics store returned the 15 remaining gaming computers to the manufacturer. How much could the electronics store recover from the manufacturer for the 10 gaming computers that it delivered to the college?

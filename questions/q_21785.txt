At the beginning of the experiment the volumes in both arms are the same, and the level of the liquid is therefore at the same height. The membrane is permeable to water and to sodium and chloride ions, but not to glucose. The apparatus is allowed to stand for three days.      The net movement of water molecules will be from Side X to Side Y because water molecules will move from the solution with the lower osmotic potential to the solution with the higher osmotic potential when the two are separated by a selectively permeable membrane.

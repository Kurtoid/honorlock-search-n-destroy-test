As you know, our bodies depend on food for the nutrients it needs to survive. This week's simulations refer to the chemical and physical properties of the biological macromolecules found in the variety of foods that we need to have a healthy life.  There are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids); each is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions. Based on your experience with any or both of the two available simulations for this week answer in your own words the following questions: 1. How are the molecules included in the simulation(s) formed?  2. What functions do they serve?  3.What kind of tests were used to identify its presence or absence in different food groups? 4. Depending on the simulation chosen, can you answer one or both of the following two questions? a)  Are you be able to use your carbohydrates knowledge to figure out which foods will cause a spike in the blood glucose levels?, b) Can you use your macromolecule knowledge to convince your friend to change her diet to a healthier one?

An auger-hole test uses a 20 cm diameter hole, which is 1.5 m deep. The underlying impermeable layer is at a depth of 3.5 m below the soil surface. The stable water table in the soil is 50 cm below the soil surface. During the test, the water level rises from 135 cm below the soil surface to 115 cm below the soil surface in 389 seconds (which is well within the constraint hn ~ 0.75 ho). Find the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil.

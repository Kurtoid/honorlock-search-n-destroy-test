Answer one of the following prompts in approximately 200 words.   The Sirens can be seen as examples of femme fatales-- mysterious, sexually unbridled women who weaponized their feminine charms. Femme Fatales, though typically villainous, can also be seen as protofeminist warriors--women who successfully navigate male dominated societies using their powers of seduction.   I would like you to recast one or all of the the femme fatales of The Odyssey (Circe, Calypso, the Sirens, etal.) in a positive light, while arguing that they are seen as villains because they are women.  The poem Beowulf can be described as a nexus of Christianity, Germanic and Scandinavian mythologies. Discuss how the monster Grendel figures as mixture of these cultures. Hints: Cain, wanderer, troll.  Contrast Beowulf's (from Beowulf) journey with that of Dante's (from Inferno). Beowulf uses (and breaks) a number of swords while committing heroic quests. Discuss the phallic nature of Beowulf's swords. In other words, how are Beowulf's swords an extension of his manhood? How is Beowulf's hero status tied to his masculinity? Hints: In the selection we read for this class, there are three swords of note: the sword "that was both precious object and token of honor" that Hrothgar gives Beowulf for killing Grendel (1023); Hrunting, the sword that Unferth lends to Beowulf to fight Grendel's mother (1458) and which fails to do any damage to the monster; and finally, the "giant's sword" Beowulf grabs from Grendel's mother's horde of treasure (1557). Beowulf decapitates Grendel's mother with the Giant's sword, but the blade melts when it touches her poisonous blood.  How does vengeance play into Dante's sense of justice? What are the implications of basing a justice system on retribution, rather than one based on rehabilitation? Dante places a number of historical and mythological personages in hisInferno. In other words, Dante provides us with a distinctly Christian version of hell, but populates his hell-scape with well-known monsters and heroes from classic Greek and Roman mythology. Does Dante's use of characters from the Greco-Roman canon legitimize his vision concept of hell? Why or why not? Give an account of how one of Machiavelli's "Princely Virtues" can be implemented in the modern world. Apply the term "Machiavellian" to modern strategies dealing with business management, economics, parenting, or politics.   Point out at least one of the logical fallacies in Socrates' argument (as described by Plato inThe Apology of Socrates). Explain how the fallacy is committed and discuss whether or not it damages the persuasiveness of Socrates' argument.

The data from a random sample of 100 students was used to fit a least squares regression line relating test scores to the number of hours spent playing Borderlands 3 each week. The explanatory variable (hours spent playing Borderlands 3) had a range of 0 - 18 and the response variable (test score) ranged from 39 - 99%. The resulting prediction equation is y = 39 + 3.3x. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient is 0.65. Determine if the following statements are TRUE or FALSE. a. The association between hours playing Borderlands 3 and test score is strong. [association] b. The regression equation predicts that as hours spent playing Borderlands 3 decreases, test score decreases. [relationship]

You can use MATLAB either through UF Apps or if you have student license downloaded version of it. Here is the link for UF Apps: https://info.apps.ufl.edu/Links to an external site. The compound interest equation shows how much a given amount of 'money' will be worth after t years (t is a positive integer) based on the interest rate r (r is in decimals) :   [in case image above is not visible, here is the formula:                                        future_value = money*(   (1 + r/12)^12t  )  ] First ask the user for How much Money: and Interest Rate (percent):  Write a program to display how many years it will take to make their 'money' at least x*times of the given 'money' (x is positive integer greater than 1 given by the user).  (Note: the user will give r in %age but you need to divide it by 100 and then use it in the formula) money = input('How much Money: ');r = input('Interest rate (percent): ');x = input('How many times do you want to make your money?

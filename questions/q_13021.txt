A company makes 4 juice products using orange, grapefruit, and pineapple juice. The 4 products are sold in quart containers: (1) Orange juice sells for $1.00 per quart, (2) grapefruit juice sells for $0.90 per quart, (3) pineapple juice sells for $0.80 per quart, and (4) all-in-one juice sells for $1.10 per quart. The all in-one product must consist of at least 20% orange juice and at least 20% grapefruit juice. The all-in-one product may consist of no more than 40% pineapple juice. On hand, there are 400 gallons of orange juice, 300 gallons of grapefruit juice, and 200 gallons of pineapple juice. The cost per gallon is $2.00 for orange juice, $1.60 for grapefruit juice, and $1.40 for pineapple juice. [Note: There are four quarts in a gallon]. The manager wants the ratio of the number of quarts of orange juice to the number of quarts of all-in-one juice to be at least 7 to 5. She also wants the ratio of the number of quarts of pineapple juice to the number of quarts of grapefruit juice to be at least 7 to 5. Prepare a linear programming formulation of this problem that will determine how many quart containers of each product to produce so as to maximize total profit. (Just provide the formulation -- do not attempt to solve or partially-solve the problem in any way).

This following problem is linear regression and correlation. A random sample of 10 of test scores and and number of hours spent studying for a test are as follows.     Number of hours x 17    24    21    12    34    26    32    24    11    19   Test Scores y 69    81    79    93    77    75    94    88    60    70      A) Find the linear correlation value for the test statistic r=[rvalue1] Round to 3 decimal places. B)  Using a 0.05 significance level, what is the critical value from the table? r=[rvalue2] Round to 3 decimal places. C) There A is / B is not  a significant linear correlation.  [letter1] Just type the letter. D) Determine the regression equation. y=[yint]+[slope]x Round each answer to 3 decimal places. E) Can you use the regression equation to make a prediction? A Yes B No [letter2] Just type the letter. F) If the number of hours studied is 15, what is the prediction of of test score? [pred] Round to 1 decimal place.

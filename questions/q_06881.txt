Delta Airlines is seeking to purchase a major piece of equipment for $1.5 million.  The equipment will result in annual cost savings of $600,000 over the next 3 years.  The asset will be fully depreciated on a straight-line basis over the next 3 years.  Delta then intends to sell the asset at the end of 3 years for $300,000.  The equipment purchase is part of a project in which Delta will invest 10% of the equipment's value in net working capital which will be recovered at the end of 3 years.  Delta intends to finance the purchase of equipment by issuing 100,000 common stocks which are currently priced at $9.75 per share.  The company's common stock has a beta of 1.5.  The risk-free rate is 4% and the expected return on the market is 11.5%.  The remaining financing will be obtained from the issue of 25-year semiannual 8% $1,000 par value bonds that would sell at 105%.  The company falls within the 20% tax bracket.  Use NPV to advise Delta whether it should acquire the equipment.  Your supporting evidence should identify the computations/calculator inputs for:  Year 0, Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 cash flows Required rate of return (cost of financing) of the equipment NPV

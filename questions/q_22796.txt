QUESTION 2     Two blocks with masses of 20 kg and 5 kg respectively are connected by a light, unstretched string, P. A second light, unstretched string, Q, attached to the 5 kg block, runs over a light, frictionless pulley. A constant, horizontal force of 250 N pulls the second string as shown in the attached diagram. The magnitudes of the tension in P and Q are T1 and T2 respectively. Ignore the effects of air friction.   Right click on the following blue button to open the diagram in a new tab.       2.1   Define Newton's Second Law of Motion in words.   (3)     2.2   Draw a labeled free force diagram showing ALL the forces acting on the 5 kg block.   (3)     2.3   Calculate the magnitude of the tension T1 in string P.   (6)     2.4   When the 250 N force is replaced with a sharp pick on the string, one of the two strings break. Which ONE of the two strings, P or Q, will break?   (1)             [13]
Do you watch television via cable or satellite or can you access the content you want online?  In a recent Pew Research Center survey of a random sample of 583 U.S. adults who do not subscribe to cable or satellite TV at home, 414 of them said that they can access the content they want online.  You are going to construct a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of U.S. adults who do not subscribe to cable or satellite TV that access the content they want online.    a. Which of the necessary assumptions are met? I. A SRS was taken. II. The population is normally distributed. III. The sample size is at least 15. IV. The sample size is at least 30. V. Successes and failures are both at least 15. For credit, you must choose all of the assumptions that apply. [1]   b. What is the margin of error? [2]   c. Calculate the 95% confidence interval. [3]   d. Given the following two statements: I. The symbol for the point estimate is

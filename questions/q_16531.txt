The Florida panther is an endangered subspecies of puma and was once widely distributed across the southeastern United States.  In the past, it was legal to kill these large cats because they were considered a threat to humans as well as livestock.  By the 1980s, there were only 20 - 30 Florida panthers left and for this reason they were placed on the endangered species list. Because of inbreeding, abnormalities such as low sperm quality, heart defects, and kinked tails were observed in this population.  Due to concerns about the effects of inbreeding, 8 female Texas pumas were released into the Florida panther population in 1995.  Since the introduction of these Texas pumas, the Florida panther population has increased.  Currently there are approximately 350 panthers (excluding kittens) in Florida.    (Source: Hostetler, et.al. Oecologia 168; 2012)   1. The decrease in the Florida panther population is due to [Q1]. 2. The increase in abnormalities in the panther population is best described as [Q2]. 3. Introduction of the Texas pumas into the Florida panther population is an example of [Q3].

QUESTION 5     A wooden block, mass 1.59 kg, rests on the side of a table that is 1.2 m above the ground. A bullet, weighing 0.01 kg, moving horizontally at an unknown velocity, hits the wooden block on the table. After impact, the bullet hits the block, which then falls to the ground and hits the ground at a velocity of 5 m.s-1.   Right click on the following blue button to open ALL THE IMAGES for QUESTION 5, in a new tab.         5.1   Use the principle of conservation of mechanical energy to calculate the magnitude of the velocity at which the block leaves the table.   (5)     5.2   If friction between the block and the table top is taken into account, how will it affect the final velocity of the block-bullet system? Write only INCREASE, DECREASE or STAY THE SAME.   (1)         A crate with a mass of 40 kg must be loaded on a truck by sliding it upwards over an inflexible steel beam from point X (on the ground) to point Y (at the level of the truck). The warehouse foreman uses the principle of conserving mechanical energy to solve the problem without thinking about the frictional force. He calculates that he can get the crate against the steel beam to point Y (which is 0.8 m above the ground) by pushing it at X at an initial speed of 4 m.s-1 and then releasing it.   Please make use of Diagram 2, Question 5 to assist in answering the following questions.         5.3   Point Y is 0.8 m above the ground. Use the principle of conservation of mechanical energy to calculate the kinetic energy of the crate should friction not cause any energy to be lost.   (5)     5.4   Draw a free force diagram, with labels, showing all the forces acting on the crate between point X and point Z.   (3)     5.5   Calculate the magnitude of the frictional force on the crate as it moves upwards .   (6)             [20]

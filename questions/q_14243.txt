Implement a Linked List ADT using a struct and seven functions. A list is a resizing collection that we can use to store elements. Although a list is an OOP concept, we can still implement it in C with a clever design. We will even aim to implement it such that any datatype may be stored in it. The struct should contain variables to represent an internal data structure, and the size of the collection. Create seven functions: list_create, list_destroy, list_add, list_get, list_set, list_indexOf, and list_size. Descriptions of each are shown on the next page. Your ADT will be structured with three files: main.c, LinkedList.h, and LinkedList.c. The first file (main.c) is provided below, while you will need to implement LinkedList.h/c. The main.c file contains testing code that uses the list you will be implementing - it indirectly shows the syntax for the functions. main.c #include  #include "LinkedList.h" int main() { list* lst; lst = list_create(); list_add(lst, 10); list_add(lst, 15); list_add(lst, 20); printf("@1: %dn", list_get(lst, 1)); printf("Size: %dn", list_size(lst)); list_set(lst, 1, 99); printf("@1: %dn", list_get(lst, 1)); list_set(lst, 10, 72); printf("72 is @: %dn", list_indexOf(lst, 72)); printf("Size: %dn", list_size(lst)); list_destroy(&lst); return 0; }   Output: @1: 15Size: 3@2: 9972 is @: 10Size: 11 For LinkedList.h, see below: ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// //Include Files #include  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// //Type Definitions typedef struct list list; ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// //Function Declarations //borrowed from docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html //purpose: creates a new list and returns it. //return: error value (zero for success, non-zero for error) list* list_create(); //purpose: destroys a list. //return: n/a void list_destroy(list** lst); //purpose: appends the specified element to the end of this list. //return: n/a void list_add(list* lst, void* element); //purpose: Returns the element at the specified position in this list. //return: element void* list_get(list* lst, int idx); //purpose: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the element, or -1 // if this list does not contain the element. //return: index or -1 if not found int list_indexOf(list* lst, void* ele); //purpose: replaces the element at the specified position in this // list with the specified element. //return value: n/a void list_set(list* lst, int idx, void* element); //purpose: returns the size of the list. //return: number of elements in the list int list_size(list* lst);   [Acuna] For LinkedList.c, select the necessary headers, define the needed structs, and write the seven collection functions: (a) For LinkedList.c, write code to bring in the proper header files: ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// //Include Files//TODO: IMPLEMENT THIS

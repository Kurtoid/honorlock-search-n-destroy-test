The following data is the quantification of bacterial survivors following 24 hours exposure to a series of experimental antimicrobial compounds.  Prior to viable counting the total volume of the initial sample was 10 mL. From this initial sample, a series of 1:10 dilutions were performed. A volume of 250 mL of diluted bacterial suspension was set into molten agar.  Using the data provided complete the following paragraph. CFU values that would normally be represented as 1x106 will be shown as 1x10^6 in the possible answers   The results from this experiment suggest that [COMPOUND1] was the most effective antimicrobial agent with a total of [NUMBER1] CFU surviving treatment, while [COMPOUND2] was the least effective antimicrobial agent with [NUMBER2] CFU/mL surviving treatment. The concentration of bacteria present in the untreated control was [NUMBER3] CFU/mL.

You can use MATLAB either through UF Apps or if you have student license downloaded version of it. Here is the link for UF Apps: https://info.apps.ufl.edu A word is a palindrome if it reads the same backwards as it does forward (ex. racecar, rotator, abccba). Write a program to determine whether or not the characters in a given string can be rearranged into a palindrome.  For example, the letters in 'cabcba' can be rearranged into 'abccba', which is a palindrome.  The user will always input letters in lowercase, with no spaces or punctuation. Display 'Yes!' if the letters of a given string can be arranged into a palindrome, otherwise display 'No!'. Note: You do not have to rearrange the letters, simply determine whether or not it is possible to create a palindrome out of the given string. Test Case 1: Enter a string of characters: raacrecYes! Test Case 2: Enter a string of characters: abcNo! Test Case 3: Enter a string of characters: ycycychNo! Test Case 4: Enter a string of characters: ssaaippakiviikauuppYes! Test Case 5: Enter a string of characters: abcddabcdaNo!

Title of essay: "Letter from Birmingham Jail"Author: Martin Luther King, Jr.  I would agree with St. Augustine that "an unjust law is no law at all." . . . How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? . . . An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas [a thirteenth-century Christian theologian]: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and changes the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an "I-it" relationship for an "I-thou" relationship and ends relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically, and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation and existential expression of man's tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right, and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.In the above excerpt from "Letter from Birmingham Jail," the use of a set of ellipsis points (. . .) indicates that

According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 7000 to 8000 people each year in the United States are bitten by a venomous snake, and about 20% of those bites are fatal.  Suppose we select a random sample of 240 people who have been bitten by a venomous snake this year in the US, and consider the proportion that did not survive.  The Central Limit Theorem can be applied to this situation.  Describe the shape, center and spread of the sampling distribution model for the proportion of victims that would die in a random sample of 240 people bitten by venomous snakes in the US.    Shape:   [1]       center:   [2]      spread:   [3]

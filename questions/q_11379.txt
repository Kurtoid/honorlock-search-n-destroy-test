A colleague is struggling with an emergency case and seeks your opinion. A 6-year-old male neutered DSH cat presented an hour ago with acute dyspnoea. The cat was reluctant to stand at the time and was mouth breathing and vocalising. The heart rate was around 140. Harsh lung sounds were audible on auscultation. The cat was distressed but your colleague was able to obtain the following radiographs.               The cat has been treated with 2mg/kg furosemide iv and 0.2mg/kg dexamethasone to cover possible causes of dyspnoea. The cat has been maintained in an oxygen rich environment in an incubator for an hour but is still mouth breathing, distressed and restless. On a brief physical examination you note paresis in the right hind and the quadriceps region seems firm and painful. Despite concerns about overheating in the incubator, rectal temperature is 37.8C.   A: What is the most likely primary diagnosis and the sequelae in this cat. Explain your reasoning. (4 marks)

PREDATION  Question 4. Department of Natural Resource managers, biologists, and foresters in many states work together to successfully manage game populations by determining the number of deer, bear or other animals that can be harvested each year. Harvest numbers can fluctuate based on climatic factors and natural events that affect plant production. For example, squirrels have been documented to have additional litters in "masting" years. Masting of seeds is when plants produce seeds in synchrony (all at once and together). Additionally, in the years following oak tree mastings, the number deer and squirrels that can be harvested tends to increase. Explain why mastings can influence deer and squirrel populations and also benefit the oak tree.

Here are steps of muscle contraction, in jumbled order. A. Calcium ions are released into the sarcoplasm.   B. Calcium ions combine with troponin, pulling away the tropomyosin, allowing the myosin heads to bind to the actin. The myosin head has an ATP molecule attached to it already, which undergoes hydrolysis.   C. A nerve impulse travels along the sarcolemma, down the T-tubules, and reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum   D. As the crossbridge forms, ADP and a phosphate group are released from the myosin head, resulting in the power stroke   E. After the nerve impulse ceases, calcium is returned to its storage location by active transport.

Use the multi-cycle datapath diagram for the following question.  For a single cycle processor X assume the following: 200 ps for memory operations100 ps for ALU operations50 ps for register file access (disregard the delay for all other datapath components such as multiplexors and control unit) If both a single cycle datapath X and the multi-cycle datapath Y (as shown above) are running the same benchmark consisting of the following instruction mix: 20% ld, 13% sd, 11% branch, 56% ALU instr Calculate the clock cycle time for the single cycle datapath X in ps.

Please use the Heparin Protocol to answer the questions. WEIGHT ADJUSTED HEPARIN PROTOCOLLab Orders:  STAT: PT, INR, PTT, CBC  STAT: PTT 6 hours after any Heparin BOLUS or rate adjustment.  PTT every 6 hours until two (2) consecutive PTTs are therapeutic (46 to 70). Then change PTT to every 24 hours.  Stop Heparin infusion if platelet count is less than 100,000 or platelet count drops by 50% pre-Heparin level, and notify healthcare provider.   STEPS IN CALCULATING HEPARIN DOSAGE (INITIAL DOSAGE)  Change weight in pounds to kilograms.  Calculate IV Bolus Heparin at 80 units/kg (80 units per kg).   On hand: Heparin 5000 units/1 ml   Calculate IV Heparin continuous infusion at 18 units/kg/hr (18 units per kg per hr).   On hand: Heparin continuous infusion 25,000 units in 250 ml D5W.  Adjust Heparin infusion rate based on the sliding scale below (after the initial dosing and based upon subsequent PTTs):       PTT   UNITS OF HEPARIN      90    STOP Heparin for 1 hour, Then reduce Heparin infusion by 3 units/kg/hr.        The healthcare provider writes an order to initiate the weight based Heparin protocol. You are starting an infusion of heparin on a {x} pound patient. The PTT is 30. The initial infusion rate will be _____________ ml/hr. Record your answer using 1 decimal place(s). Enter only a number in the blank.

Find the mean, median, and mode of the following data set. Round any decimals to two decimal places. 12.4, 15.2, 18.7, 13.5, 16.4, 13.5, 17.1 mean = [blank1] median = [blank2] mode = [blank3]
Write a method divisors(int n) that returns the number of divisors of a positive integer n that is passed into the method. A divisor of an integer n, also called a factor of n, is an integer which divides n without leaving a number. For example, the number 200 has 12 divisors (1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 200). Therefore divisors(200) should return 12. It is easy to test whether a number is a divisor or another number by the modulus operation. For example, 25 is a divisor of 200 because 200 % 25 is equal to 0; 6 is not a divisor of 200 because 200 mod 6 is equal to 2.    Note: You do not need to write a main method.

The inner surface of a plane wall with 1 m2 surface area is maintained at 300degC. The conduction heat transfer resistance for the wall is 0.4 K/W. The outer surface of the wall is convectively cooled by air at 25degC. Determine the convective heat transfer coefficient if the temperature at the outer wall surface is 50degC.

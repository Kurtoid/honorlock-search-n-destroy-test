Read the following Introduction paragraph and body paragraph, and choose the correct answer to the following question: are all of the in-text citations documented correctly in the following excerpt?                          Introduction: 1.Imagine how many families in America include a family member who regularly consumes alcohol. 2.Several recent studies prove that the numbers are large, but many people do not understand the effect that alcohol use has on the family (Jost 56). 3.Susie Smith, author of the book Families in Crisis and a professor of Sociology at Yale University, argues that alcohol use leads to broken homes. 4.In her article, "Alcohol Abuse-Does Alcohol Use By a Parent Negatively Impact His or Her Family: Pro," she defends her position on the dangers of alcohol abuse. 5.On the other hand, James Johnson, a law professor at Stanford, condemns the use of alcohol, but he does not believe it ultimately hurts families; he validates his position in his article, "Alcohol Abuse-Does Alcohol Use By a Parent Negatively Impact His or Her Family: Con." 6.Smith uses outside sources and appeals to logic, while Johnson focuses on statistics and appeals to emotion, as these elements help him support his position.             First Rhetorical Tool body paragraph: 7.Rhetorical tools are used throughout Smith's article. 8.She uses outside sources to defend her argument. 9.Smith cites a 2010 report published in the Journal of Family Law and written by James McKey indicating that alcohol abuse is the second leading cause of marital break-ups in the United States (Smith, par. 5). 10.The rate of divorce due to alcohol use is even higher when children are involved (par. 5). 11.Studies show, unfortunately, that the "[p]ainful effects of their parents' breakups can stay with children for years" (par. 7). 12.Smith quotes Edward W. Barth, a psychiatrist and author of the new book Adult Children of Divorce, who observes that "children of single mothers get involved in substance abuse . . . more than kids with fathers at home" (par. 6). 13.Smith continuously places blame on the party who abuses alcohol, whether it is the wife or husband. 14.It is so imperative that you do not use alcohol because it may lead to divorce, which then may hurt the children. 15.Susie Smith cites outside authorities to note the painful effects of divorce that can result when a parent abuses alcohol.

Case study #6 Clostridium botulinum is the causative agent of botulism. This Gram-positive, anaerobic bacillus is commonly found on plants, in soil and water, and in the intestinal tract of some animals. The main virulence factor of C. botulinum is botulism toxin, which is a protein neurotoxin that causes muscle paralysis. Death results from paralysis of respiratory muscles. Genetic analysis has led to the understanding that C. botulinum has acquired its toxin genes from lysogenic bacteriophages. Adults who ingest C. botulinum spores alone generally do not become ill. However, adult botulism will result after ingestion of food containing botulinum toxin. Boiling and common chemical treatments used for water denatures botulism toxin. Infantile botulism, rather, results after children under the age of one ingest foods, such as honey, which contains C. botulinum spores but no botulinum toxin. Once inside the infant gut, these spores germinate and botulism toxin is produced after colonization. Treatment for botulism requires injections of botulinum antitoxin, pre-made antibodies that are administered to the patient as quickly as possible.   What environmental pressure keeps  botulinum spores that are in honey from germinating inside the honey bottle?

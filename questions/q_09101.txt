Lecture Test 3, Question 20 The series of diagrams below illustrates the outcome of potential competition between two species of birds relative to two components of their niche: feeding position on a tree limb and ripeness of fruit.  The illustration in the upper left shows the boundaries for these two niche components in the absence of competition for one species (blue).  The illustration in the upper right show the boundaries for these two niche components in the absence of competition for the other species (red).  The illustration in the lower left plots the niche component boundaries together (overlaid) assuming no competition.  The illustration in the lower right shows niche component boundaries under competition.         a.  Why is the zone of actual competition (lower right illustration) less than the zone of potential competiton (lower left illustration)?       b.  Is the "blue" species expressing a fundamental niche or a realized niche?  Explain or defend your response.

LECTURA Planes para viajar: Isabel writes to her pen pal in the United States about her vacation plans. Read the email message and answer the questions below in complete sentences. (10 pts) Querida Kelly: ?Que tal? ?Como estas? Ahora no tomo mas clases, entonces (so) tengo mucho tiempo libre. Me gusta practicar muchos deportes, como el tenis, la natacion, el ciclismo y el baloncesto. Pero cuando llueve, veo videos o miro la television en casa.En una semana voy a visitar a mi amiga Ana en Santa Marta. Santa Marta esta al pie de (at the base of) las montanas de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. !Es un lugar muy bonito! Hay muchos lugares interesantes alli con oportunidades para descansar, practicar deportes o hacer turismo arqueologico, ecologico y de aventura. Despues vamos a ir a El Rodadero en la costa (coast), el principal centro turistico en el area. Es un lugar ideal porque tiene playas blancas y aguas azules. Sabes que me gusta muchisimo la musica y en El Rodadero vamos a escuchar conciertos de musica del Caribe al aire libre. Bueno, en cinco minutos voy a salir con mis padres. Vamos al cine para ver una pelicula. Espero recibir tu mensaje pronto. Isabel    ?Por que tiene Isabel mucho tiempo libre? [1notomaclases] ?Que le gusta hacer cuando hace mal tiempo? [2legustavervideosymirarlatele] ?Por que desea Isabel ir a Santa Marta?  [3asuamigaAna] El Rodadero es un lugar de... [4silasmontanasylacosta] ?A que tipo de concierto va Isabel?

A paper presented a novel design of a low-cost and high-throughput thermoplastic PMMA Lab-on-a-Chip device for conducting microscale biochemical reactions.  The miniaturized plastic device was fabricated as shown below by utilizing PMMA substrates modified with a poly(dimethylsiloxane) interfacial coating.  Surface characterizations were carried out and bond strength was measured.        Fig. 1  Schematic showing the bonding mechanism of two PMMA substrates through a PDMS interfacial coating. (A) Plasma treatment of PMMA and attachment of APTES. (B) Subsequent coating of epoxy-PDMS on APTES-coated PMMA.  The APTES and epoxy-PDMS were linked via amine-epoxy bond formation. (C) Surface oxidation and subsequent contact of two epoxy-PDMS-coated PMMA substrates. (D) Bonding of two epoxy-PDMS-coated PMMA substrates by embossing at 80degC for 20 minutes under 0.1 MPa to form a siloxane bond (Si-O-Si) linkage.    (PMMA, poly(methylmethacrylate); PDMS, poly(dimethylsiloxane); APTES, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane)      Fig. 2 shows the results of the water contact angle measurements performed on the surfaces of PDMS (pristine) and PMMA (pristine, oxygen plasma-treated, APTES-coated, and epoxy-PDMS-coated) substrates. PMMA was used as the model substrate and pristine PDMS as a reference.  The PDMS is more (hydrophilic / hydrophobic) [1] than the pristine (pure) PMMA.  The plasma-treatment of PMMA caused the contact angle to exhibit more (spreading / de-wetting / advancing / receding) [2] behavior, indicating that the surface became more (hydrophilic / hydrophobic) [3].  This suggests the plasma-treated surface had become oxidized as needed for the reaction in Step A in Fig. 1.  The contact angle then changed again after the treatment steps with aminosilane (APTES) and then the epoxy-terminated PDMS.  After the treatments of PMMA substrate were completed to form a monolayer of PDMS, the water contact angle increased to a value almost equivalent to that of the pristine PDMS, suggesting that the PDMS monolayer was successfully grafted onto the PMMA surface.  - This was a nice quick test of their reaction steps, but if they wanted to be more rigorous, which method would be best suited for determining the actual chemical composition of the aminosilane modified surface (Step A)?  (ATR-FTIR / ESCA / AFM / EDS) [4] - Which tool might be best for doing a compositional depth profile to determine the thickness of the PDMS polymeric layer that was created in Step C? (ATR-FTIR / ESCA / AFM / EDS) [5]

One of the things we talked about in Storytelling was the "Story Purpose and Characteristics."  We discussed about 8 different types in class.  They include 1) Spark Action, 2) Communicate about you, 3) Transmit values, 4) Communicate about the firm, 5) Foster collaboration, 6) Tame rumors, 7) Share knowledge, 8) Lead into the future.  None of those were specifically about the purpose of Communicating Quantitative Results. As we went through those in the lecture, I tried to describe how the characteristics of those might be similar to the characteristics of Communicating Quantitative Results.  Discuss what these characteristics are.

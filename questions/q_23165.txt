. A woman's husband died in an operating room and the woman visited a medical malpractice lawyer to determine whether she should sue the doctors and the hospital.  The husband was in his 80s when this happened.  The lawyer said he would look into the potential liability of the hospital and doctors.  Unfortunately, the lawyer became busy with other cases and he did not have time to examine the records the woman had given him.  The lawyer also did not hire an expert to review the medical file.  Instead, he told the woman that given her husband's age, she should probably not sue the hospital or the doctors.  The lawyer said, "your husband enjoyed a good life."  Two years later, after the statute of limitations had run in the medical malpractice case, the woman saw one of the doctors who had operated on her husband and the doctor remarked how he was surprised she had not filed a suit because they had clearly committed malpractice in the care of her husband. If the woman sues the lawyer, is the lawyer likely to be liable in tort to the woman (assuming that she had a case against the doctors and the hospital)?

Source D:     So, it came about that the king of Mali enclosed (established) a large part of Western Sudan within a single system of law and order. He did this so successfully that the Moroccan writer IbnBatuta, traveling through Mali about twelve years after Musa's death, found 'complete and general safety in the land.

VRAAG 3     'n Warmlugballon styg vertikaal teen 'n konstante snelheid. Wanneer die warmlugballon punt A 'n paar meter bo die grond bereik, laat 'n man in die warmlugballon 'n bal val wat die grond tref en bons. Ignoreer die effekte van wrywing. Die snelheid-tyd-grafiek aangeheg stel die beweging van die bal voor van die oomblik wat dit laat val word tot nadat dit vir die eerste keer bons. Die tydinterval tussen die verskillende kere wat dit bons, word geignoreer. DIE OPWAARTSE RIGTING WORD AS POSITIEF GENEEM. GEBRUIK INLIGTING UIT DIE GRAFIEK EN BEANTWOORD DIE VRAE WAT VOLG.   Regterklik op die onderstaande blou blokkie om die diagram in 'n nuwe venster oop te maak.         3.1   Wat beteken die term vryval.

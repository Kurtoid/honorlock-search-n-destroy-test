CASE 5:  A 7-year-old boy is taken to the emergency room by his mother after she finds him unresponsive in his bed. She states that her son was sent home from school 3 days earlier after showing flu-like symptoms. He awoke the next morning with body aches, a cough, a sore throat, and a runny nose. After 2 days of taking over-the-counter children's cold medicine, he had not improved. Upon arriving at the hospital, he is dehydrated, pale, and shaky. The physician notes that he is wheezing and has slight difficulty breathing. A chest X-ray indicates pneumonia of the right lung, which is subsequently determined to be viral.  Additional examination of the virus reveals that its genome consists of the nucleotides Adenine, Guanine, Thymine, and Cytosine. Further analysis reveals that the amount of Adenine is equal to the amount of Thymine, and the amount of Guanine is equal to the amount of Cytosine. Given what you know about nucleic acids, you can reasonably conclude that the genome of this virus is _____.

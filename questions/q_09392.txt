Callahan Auto, a manufacturing company, has two service (i.e., support) departments and two production (i.e., operating) departments.  The service/support departments are Maintenance and Grounds.  The two production departments are Fabricating and Assembly.  Callahan management has decided to allocate Maintenance costs on the basis of machine hours used by the departments and Grounds costs on the basis of square feet occupied by the departments.  The following data appear in the company's records.     Support Dept. Support Dept. Prod. Dept. Prod. Dept.    Maintenance Dept. Grounds Dept. Fabricating Assembly   Budgeted manufacturing overhead/indirect costs $18,000 $14,000 $45,000 $25,000   Machine hours used 0 2,000 12,000 6,000   Square feet occupied 2,800 0 16,000 21,200      If Callahan uses the reciprocal method to allocate support department costs, what would be the Fabricating department's total indirect costs after both the Maintenance and the Grounds departments' costs have been allocated to the production departments?  Round percentages to two decimal places (e.g., 15.445% would be 15.45% or .1545) and round dollar amounts to the nearest whole dollar (e.g., $30,145))

6. Each year seasoned mountaineers as well as many novice climbers looking for a once in a lifetime experience attempt the hardest endurance climb in the lower 48 states.  The glaciated peek of Mt. Rainier, located outside of Seattle Washington, stands at 14,411 feet.  From one of the more popular high camps, Camp Muir at 10,100', climbers start their 8-12 hour push for the summit in the early morning hours (between 1am and 4am), climbing in the darkness by the light of their headlamps.  A study was conducted to see if the length of time to run 5 miles at sea level could be used to predict the length of time to reach the summit.  A random sample of 16 mountaineers was selected and data on the length of time (in minutes) to run 5 miles (x) and the length of time (in hours) to reach the summit (y) was used to fit a straight-line model.  The results of the simple linear regression are provided below.

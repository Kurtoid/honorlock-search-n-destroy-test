Background For this exam, you will be predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task!  Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.  The data consists of a data frame with 4177 observations on the following 8 variables: 1. Sex: M, F, and I (infant) (categorical)2. Length: Longest shell measurement in mm (continuous)3. Diameter: Perpendicular to length in mm (continuous)4. Height: Height with meat in shell in mm (continuous)5. Whole: Weight of whole abalone in grams (continuous)6. Viscera: Gut weight (after bleeding) in grams (continuous)7. Shell: Shell weight after being dried in grams (continuous)8. Rings: Number of rings of the abalone -- corresponds with the age (discrete) Read the data Read the data and answer the questions below using the supplied R Markdown / Jupyter notebook file.  # Load relevant libraries (add here if needed)library(car)library(aod)# Read the data setabaloneFull = read.csv("abalone.csv",head=T)row.cnt = nrow(abaloneFull)# Split the data into training and testing setsabaloneTest = abaloneFull[(row.cnt-9):row.cnt,]abalone = abaloneFull[1:(row.cnt-10),] Note: Use abalone as your dataset for the following questions unless otherwise stated.

CASE 2: Mrs. Smith, a 62-year-old housewife, is admitted to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps that have become severe. Mrs. Smith's daughter states that her mother was complaining of blurred vision and difficulty swallowing when they were having lunch. Upon assessment, the nurse observes drooping of the patientes eyelids and facial muscles on both sides of her face. Vital signs are stable with blood pressure at 126/84, pulse at 82, and temperature 98.3degF. However, her respirations are 10 (normal is 18-20). The physician on-call performs a neurological test that shows deficits on both sides of the body. The doctor orders blood work and asks the daughter what Mrs. Smith had eaten in the last few days. The daughter advises the doctor that Mrs. Smith cans her own vegetables and had eaten from one of the jars. Mrs. Smith begins to have weakness in her arms and legs. Paralysis starts developing in her upper extremities, and soon after she stops breathing. She is placed on a ventilator. Microscopic examination reveals Gram (+) rods. The blood work comes back positive for botulism toxin.  The physician decides to prescribe CIPRO (a broad spectrum antibiotic) to help the patient fight off the infection. CIPRO inhibits the bacterial enzyme DNA Gyrase, which is required for _____.

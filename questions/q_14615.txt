Exam 2: TVM, Mortgage Refi & Capital Budgeting *Open the "Exam 1 Student Answer File.xlsx " workbook and complete all work in this file. The password to the file is 60167918249.  For each of the questions, do your work in the appropriate worksheet in the area under the problem number (Problem 1, Problem 2, etc.). Be sure that your answer to each question appears in the light blue cell (labeled "Answer:") just under the problem number. If you do not put your answer in the "Answer:" cell, you will be penalized.  In the worksheet named "P1-P5" answer questions 1-5, using built in Excel functions and setting up the models so that the answer automatically changes with a change with any input (i.e., be sure to reference cells in your calculations rather than typing numbers into the functions/formulas). Also, ensure that each of your inputs (rate, PV, FV, etc.) are clearly labeled.  What is the present value of $23,400 to be received in 11 years if the discount rate is 5.7% APR, and the discount period is daily (i.e., we have daily compounding)? (5 points)     If you deposit $1,450 at the end of each of the next 9 years into an account paying 2.81% interest, how much money will you have in the account in 18 years? Assume that you make no other deposits to or withdrawals from the account after 9 years. (5 points)     Suppose you start with $3,150. How many years will it take to triple in value assuming an APR of 3.75%, compounded monthly? (5 points)     Assume that you can deposit $318.62 at the end of each year for the next 12 years, but you need $5,200 immediately after the last payment at the end of year 12. What APR with annual compounding must you earn to achieve this goal? (5 points)     Suppose that you purchased a home 120 months ago and took out a 30-year mortgage with an APR of 4.27% for $140,000 to finance the home. How much would you still owe on the loan after 120 months? (5 points)    Complete question 6 in the worksheet labeled "P6."  You plan to purchase a house for $210,000 and pay a 20% down payment. The bank charges closing costs of 3% of the loan amount. You will roll the closing costs into the amount you finance. Assume that you will finance the house over 25 years with monthly payments and that the bank charges a 5.79% APR on the loan. Develop an amortization table for the loan. (10 points)  Clearly, there is no "Answer" cell for this question because the entire amortization table is your answer. Create the table beginning in cell F2 (use the space in the first few columns to do any necessary calculations), and make sure that you label the columns of the table appropriately.      Complete the following questions in the worksheet labeled "P7-P9." Suppose that Smith's Bakery is considering the addition of a new line of cakes to its product offerings. It is expected that each cake will sell for $11 and that the cost per cake will be $7. Total fixed operating costs are expected to be $9,000. Smith's faces a tax rate of 30%, will have interest expense of $1,950 and expects to sell about 2,100 cakes in the first year. Assume that the number of cakes sold is expected to increase by 12% from year 1 to year 2 (assume that the fixed costs, tax rate and interest expense will be unchanged in year 2).  Complete the model that has already been set up in the P7-P9 worksheet, entering the inputs from the information given above under Assumptions and estimating everything from the firm's Revenues down to its Profit Margin (=net income/revenues) for years 1 and 2. All of the forecasted numbers (Revenues, costs, etc.) should be formatted in the Currency number format (zero decimal places) except profit margin, which should be formatted in Percentage number format (to two decimal places). (5 points) Complete the two-input data table that begins in cell F5, demonstrating what happens to Year 1 Profit Margin when Unit Sales and Price/Unit vary as follows. Be sure to format the resulting output in Percentage form (two decimal places) and hide the reference to the Profit Margin cell in the model. (5 points)  Unit Sales: 1800, 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200, 2300 Price per Unit: $9, $10, $11, $12, $13   In worksheet P7-P9: Set up two scenarios in the Scenario Manager to help Smith's do some risk analysis on the new cake line. The scenarios should be named "Best Case" and "Worst Case" with the following assumptions: (5 points)  Best Case: Price per Unit = $13, Unit Sales = 2500, Cost per Unit = $6 and Unit Sales Growth in Year 2 = 15%. Worst Case: Price per Unit = $9, Unit Sales = 1700, Cost per Unit = $8 and Unit Sales Growth in Year 2 = 9%.  Generate the scenario Summary Table. The table should show results for Year 1 and Year 2 Revenues and Profit Margin. Be sure that the resulting table shows the initial assumptions for unit sales, price per unit, etc. under "Current Values." Also, ensure that you change the labels in the resulting scenario table from the cell references to the variable names to correctly identify the "Changing Cells" and the "Result Cells."(5 points)      Complete the following in the "P10" worksheet. 10. Darby's fine furniture makes three models of luxury couches: A, B and C. Each couch requires different amounts of time for framing, cushioning and covering, given in the table below (also provided within the P11 worksheet). In addition, the profit per couch is provided. Use the data in the table below and Excel's Solver tool to determine the number of each model Darby's should make to maximize their total profit. (10 points)    Complete the following in the "P11" worksheet. 11. Rising Crust Pizza is analyzing the prospect of purchasing an additional fire brick oven. The oven costs $50,000 and would require an additional $1,500 installation. It would be depreciated (straight-line) to a book value of $0 in 10 years. The extra oven would increase annual revenues by $15,000 and annual operating expenses by $8,600.  Rising Crust's marginal tax rate is 30%. Assume that the oven can be sold for a salvage value of $20,000 at the end of 10 years and that the firm's WACC is 8%.    a. What would be the initial (year 0) cash flow associated with purchasing the additional oven? (5 points) b. What are the yearly operating cash flows? (10 points) c. What is the terminal cash flow generated by the new oven? (5 points) d. What is the payback period for the additional oven? Round your answer to two decimal places. (5 points) e. What is the NPV of the additional oven? Round your answer to two decimal places. (5 points) f. What is the IRR of the additional oven? Round your answer to two decimal places and format in Percentage form. (5 points)      Bonus Do the following computation in the "Bonus" worksheet (although obviously the user-defined function must be written in the Visual Basic Editor).  Write a user-defined function for the following equation and name it "MYFV." Then use it to compute the future value at the end of 10 years of $600 assuming an interest rate of 5% compounded monthly. (5 points)   where r is the same thing as "RATE" in built-in Excel functions and t is the same thing as "NPER" in built-in functions. If you complete the bonus question, you MUST save your file as a Macro-Enabled workbook. If you do not, I will not be able to see the user-defined function you wrote, and you won't receive the bonus points. Once you have completed your exam, upload your completed Excel file to this question. Please rename the Excel file using the initial of your first name, your last name and "Exam1." For example, Jane Doe would rename her quiz file "JDoeExam1." After you have uploaded your file, you may submit your exam which will automatically close you out of Honorlock.

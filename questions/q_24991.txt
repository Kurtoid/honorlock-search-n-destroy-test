I.  A robust economy in 1888--at least for a few people--came from an fairly unregulated economy with virtually no labor laws, or Environmental Protection Agency, so we should have something similar in 2021. People lived for centuries without understanding the germ theory of infection, which was discovered in 1844 but not fully applied in medicine until at least 1900. Why should I wash my hands? The culture of dueling with knives has been a means of testing one's honor and dexterity for two hundred years.

Assume there is a 5-stage pipeline that has no structural hazards and supports data forwarding from the EX/MEM buffers and MEM/WB buffers to the inputs of the ALU muxes in the EX stage. Branch behavior is known at the end of the EX stage of the pipeline. For a given workload, comprised of 30% branches, 20% loads, 10% stores, and 40% ALU instructions, what is the average CPI if:   10% of the branches are miss-predicted and 40% of instructions have a data dependence on the instruction immediately prior to them (e.g., ADD R1, R2, R3 is followed by SUB R4, R1, R1, which is data dependent on the ADD).

QUESTION 3         3.1   This question involves information provided from a medical source, as well as a graph that needs to be analysed and studied.  The graph related to the information from a medical source, is linked to the blue button below:         One of the functions of the kidneys is to regulate the pH balance in the body.  This involves regulating the H-ion concentration in the body fluids.  When the H-ion concentration is too high, the body fluids become acidic, and this is referred to acidosis.  When the H-ion concentration in the body fluids is too low (too alkali), the patient is said to have alkalosis.  These two conditions are regulated by the movement (or not) of water to the tubules. When a person drinks a large amount of water, a condition called diuresis occurs, where large amounts of water are excreted.   The graph attached is illustrating a patient's urine output.  The patient drank 1L of water and 30 minutes later, his urine output increased. The delay in the onset of water diuresis is mainly due to the time it takes the ADH that has already been secreted, to now be inhibited.    Adapted from an American Journal of Physiology

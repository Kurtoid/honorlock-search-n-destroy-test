Copy and paste this table into the answer field and then enter your responses.    Monthly Mild Production            Z-score -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3      B) Copy and paste the chart provided below into the answer field below. Refer to the your results in part A) to complete the chart. Insert the milk production values that are boundaries for the indicated classes based on the z-scores. Complete the frequency column by referring to the milk production values given at the start of the Case Study.    Class Boundaries Class Z-scores Frequency      -  to -3     -3 to -2     -2 to -1     -1 to 0     0 to 1     1 to 2     2 to 3     3 to       C) Copy and paste the provided chart into the answer field below.

Q1 of 4: Use this information for this question and the next three questions:A geneticist is mapping the chromosomes of a newly identified species, with the common name gremlins. An individual called Stripe has been captured and is being bred in order to understand gremlin genetics. Stripe is heterozygous for three linked genes with alleles Ee, Hh, and Bb, that determine if gremlins are evil (E), have hair (H), and biting teeth (B). In order to determine if the three genes are linked, a standard testcross was done to another captive gremlin that is homozygous recessive for alleles at all three genes. One thousand offspring were collected and found to have the following genotypes:    48 ee Hh bb       36 ee hh Bb       400 ee Hh Bb       4 Ee Hh Bb       426 Ee hh bb       46 Ee hh Bb       38 Ee Hh bb       2 ee hh bb    Disregarding the gene order, which may or may not be correct as shown, which of the below best represents the arrangement (configuration) of the alleles on Stripes' chromosomes?

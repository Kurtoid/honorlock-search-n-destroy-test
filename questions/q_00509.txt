A study was carried out to investigate whether there is a relationship between the percent of hearing loss and the volume at which people typically listen to music. Ten high school students agreed to participate in a study. Each was given a music player with headphones and was asked to listen to music for 10 minutes. The students were told to adjust the volume to a comfortable setting. After 10 minutes, the volume setting, which ranges from 1 to 10, was observed for each student. Each student then took a hearing test, and a measure of hearing loss (in percent) was recorded. The data are shown in the table below. Use technology to calculate the correlation coefficient, and explain what you can infer about this relationship from the correlation coefficient.  Specifically interpret the strength and direction of trend for this data.     Volume Setting (x)   Hearing Loss (y)    8 23   10 24   1 11   4 9   5 15   8 19   3 14   1 5   2 7   8 15

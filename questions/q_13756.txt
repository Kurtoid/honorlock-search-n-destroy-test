Suppose a researcher is planning a step-by-step smoking cessation program aimed at youth aged 16-18 years old that have been smoking for over a year. After 1 month, the program is intended to get people down below 1 pack of cigarettes (20 cigarettes) a week.  Suppose after 1 month, a group of 62 smokers in this age range are smoking an average of 11.6 cigarettes a week with a standard deviation of 2.7. Is there sufficient evidence that the cessation program is working? First,  though, set up your hypotheses and interpret your p-value correctly using the alpha level of 0.05. This means that a) you must give me the null and the alternative hypothesis. Then, (b) you must calculate z to be able to conclude whether the cessation program works. This means, give me the p-value (estimate if you must). If you don't do all of this, you will not get full credit.

CASE 2: Mrs. Smith, a 62-year-old housewife, is admitted to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps that have become severe. Mrs. Smith's daughter states that her mother was complaining of blurred vision and difficulty swallowing when they were having lunch. Upon assessment, the nurse observes drooping of the patientes eyelids and facial muscles on both sides of her face. Vital signs are stable with blood pressure at 126/84, pulse at 82, and temperature 98.3degF. However, her respirations are 10 (normal is 18-20). The physician on-call performs a neurological test that shows deficits on both sides of the body. The doctor orders blood work and asks the daughter what Mrs. Smith had eaten in the last few days. The daughter advises the doctor that Mrs. Smith cans her own vegetables and had eaten from one of the jars. Mrs. Smith begins to have weakness in her arms and legs. Paralysis starts developing in her upper extremities, and soon after she stops breathing. She is placed on a ventilator. Microscopic examination reveals Gram (+) rods. The blood work comes back positive for botulism toxin.  The physician decides to prescribe CIPRO (a broad spectrum antibiotic) to help the patient fight off the infection. CIPRO inhibits the bacterial enzyme DNA Gyrase, which is required for _____.
Davilo Co. had the following inventory activity during April:             Unit         Units   Cost     Beginning inventory   100    $ 8      Purchase (April 3)   60   12     Sale (April 10)   80         Purchase (April 18)   50   15     Purchase (April 23)   80   18     Sale (April 28)   100             Assuming Davilo uses a periodic LIFO cost flow assumption, ending inventory at April 30 would be [1]. Assuming Davilo uses a perpetual LIFO cost flow assumption, ending inventory at April 30 would be [2]. Assuming Davilo uses a periodic weighted average cost flow assumption, the weighted average cost per unit in April would be [3].

AS is a 54-year-old business man who has a family history of lung cancer. AS started smoking at 15; years later, he got what he thought was a very bad cold that lasted for a week, started experiencing pain in his tongue, and was given ibuprofen for pain. He then noticed white sores that were getting bigger in his oral cavity near the tongue. He started feeling generally lousy and was unable to eat because of severe pain; he lost 30 lbs in a month. AS went to the clinic, where they did a biopsy that revealed squamous cell cancer of the tongue. AS has undergone radiation therapy (RT) and surgery to remove the cancer and a restorative surgery was scheduled. Because of the RT, AS has developed mucositis and xerostomia in his oral cavity. All his nodes that were sent to the laboratory tested negative for metastasis, and no further RT was needed. The surgeons felt confident that they had removed all the cancer.   HT: 5'11" UBW: 165 lbs WT: 135 lbs   Meds: Corticosteroids and antineoplastic (dexamethasone) to reduce inflammation, K depletion, Na retention; and morphine for pain. What values would be used to estimate AS's caloric requirements?

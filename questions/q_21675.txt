3.2   Lees die volgende uittreksel en beantwoord die vrae wat volg: Skielike onverwagse babadood (SOBD) word gedefinieer as die onverwagse en aanvanklik onverklaarbare dood van babas jonger as 'n jaar oud. In 2015 is 'n studie gedoen om die teenwoordigheid van mutasies in hartverwante gene in 51 gevalle van SOBD te ondersoek. Volgens beskikbare literatuur is dit baie waarskynlik dat hierdie gene die struktuur en die funksie van die ioon-kanale in hartselle beinvloed, wat lei tot aritmiee (abnormale hartklop of ritme). Die studie het bevind dat 34% van die gevalle, een of meer mutasies in hartverwante gene gehad het. Die tabel hieronder toon die ouderdomme van die SOBD-gevalle wat by die studie betrokke was:       Ouderdom (maande)   Gevalle (hoeveelheid)     0-2   35     2-4   8     4-6   6     6-8   1     8-10   1     Aangepas vanuit: Hertz, C.

T's book basis in the patent is $120,000 and T's tax basis in the patent is zero. After the acquisition, P and T file a consolidated tax return. In 20Y1 and 20Y2, the P-T group's only book-tax difference is the $20,000 book amortization expense on the patent. On December 31, 20Y3, management determines that the patent is impaired and that its remaining book value of $60,000 should be written down to zero. In 20Y3, the P-T consolidated group reports $400,000 of pre-tax book income, and the group's only book-tax differences are the $20,000 book amortization expense and the $60,000 book impairment charge with respect to the patent. What is the P-T group's book effective tax rate in 20Y3? Round to two decimal points and do not enter a percent sign (e.g., 12.34).

In some cases, Bass Pro Shops leases space to vendors to sell their products rather than purchasing the products from the vendors and then reselling them at a higher price in order to make a profit.  The amount vendors pay for the space is based on the square footage (i.e., the area) of the selling floor that is utilized to display the vendors' products. While driving home from teaching class one day, I received a call from a friend who was an assistant manager at Bass Pro Shops with a "math question."  He told me that a vendor had complained to the corporate office that they were being overcharged for the amount of floor space they were using at his store, and he wanted to know how to calculate the area of the space being used by this vendor.  The space was a triangle with side lengths of 16 feet, 13.5 feet, and 12 feet.  Bass Pro Shops charges vendors $42 per square foot to lease floor space each month. Once the overall charge is calculated, it is rounded to the nearest $10. This particular vendor was being charged $2,860 per month to display its products.

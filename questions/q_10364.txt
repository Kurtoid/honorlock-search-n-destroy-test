You are watching your friend's dog, Lucy, for a couple of weeks. Lucy is a friendly animal but barks incessantly. You decide to develop a treatment for Lucy's barking while your friend is out of town. Answer the following questions about your proposed treatment plan(s): a) You first decide to set up a DRO procedure to reinforce "quiet behavior" with dog treats and head rubs. You take some baseline data, which indicate that Lucy barks, on average, once every 2 minutes. Describe how you would determine the initial DRO schedule and the contingencies of this procedure. (Hint: What would a DRO procedure "look like" in this situation?) (2 pts) b) You try the DRO procedure for a few days, but find it challenging. You decide to try a noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) procedure instead. Describe what NCR in this situation would entail and why it might be "easier" than DRO. (2 pts) c) You eventually hire a dog trainer, who conducts a functional analysis (FA) with Lucy and tells you that her barking is maintained by social positive reinforcement in the form of attention from humans. Describe how you could use this information to design a DRA procedure (with extinction) to treat barking. (2 pts)

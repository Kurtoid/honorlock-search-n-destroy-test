In chickens, comb shape is determined by alleles at two loci (R, r and P, p). A walnut comb is produced when at least one dominant allele R is present at one locus and at least one dominant allele P is present at a second locus (genotype R_ P_). A rose comb is produced when at least one dominant allele is present at the first locus and two recessive alleles are present at the second locus (genotype R_ pp). A pea comb is produced when two recessive alleles are present at the first locus and at least one dominant allele is present at the second (genotype rr P_). If two recessive alleles are present at the first and at the second locus (rr pp), a single comb is produced.  If a cross between Rr Pp  x  rr PP occurs what is the probability of the offspring having a single comb? Comb shape: (a) walnut; (b) rose; (c) pea

Two tuning forks were found in a box. One of them has a stamp on it that says "659 E". That stamp indicates that it will vibrate back and forth 659 times per second when struck. The second tuning fork has no stamp on it. A musician takes a slow motion video of the second tuning fork after striking it, and counts the number of times it moves back and forth across 2 seconds of video. She counts 1318 repeated back and forth motions of the tuning fork arms during these 2 seconds.  What evidence supports your claim for your answer for question 9? (Discuss any calculations you made and explain what these tell you.)

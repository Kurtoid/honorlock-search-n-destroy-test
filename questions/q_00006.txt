Assume that the yield per acre for the new variety of yellow corn follows a Normal distribution with an unknown mean of m and a standard deviation of s = 10 bushels per acre.  If the average yield for these 25 plots is x-bar  = 150 bushels per acre, what is a 90% confidence interval for m?

In land snails, a single locus with two alleles determines what direction a snail's shell coils. The allele for coiling to the left (L) is completely dominant to the allele l for coiling to the right. In a population of 100 these snails, you find that 25 have shells that coil to the right. From this you that the frequency of the recessive l allele is [blank1]. the following evidence would support the conclusion that the population is in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium [blank2]

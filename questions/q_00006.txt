A healthy young mother decides not to vaccinate her new born daughter.  She never met anyone who had measles, polio, or other vaccine preventable diseases, so it didn't seem necessary.  She thought the pharmaceutical companies were all about profit and vaccines didn't seem entirely safe.  She worried about side effects and toxins in the vaccines. Six months later the mother developed a cold.  "Good thing I'm breastfeeding" she thought surely that would protect the baby.   A few days later the baby developed symptoms of coughing, sneezing, and runny nose. After one week, the cough increased and developed into a continuous cough where she could not catch her breath.

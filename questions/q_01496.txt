Scenario:  Mr. Roberts 67 M had a R total knee replacement 12 weeks ago. His knee is fully healed and pt. was progressed from a walker to a large based quad cane. The patient is referred to PT to progress to a straight cane and work on stretching and strengthening. The pt.'s goal is to return to community ambulation (curbs), use a single point cane, and work in yard. He comes in the clinic taking very short steps with the LLE. The patient is observed to have a flat back posture. When you look at him from a posterior view, his weight is shifted to the left at the hips and pelvis but the trunk is held erect. The RLE almost appears to be in a valgus position.   He states that initially he performed some simple quad sets, heel slides, and SLR, but for the past 4 weeks has become disinterested and has not done any exercise. You note that when getting him on and off the mat, he is unable to lift the R leg onto the mat independently.  He crosses his LLE under the RLE to assist the right onto the mat. You are limited in time and will only perform five (5) tests to include goniometry, inclinometry, muscle length, and/or MMT. (no balance/gait measures) Based on the scenario above, Select and justify  the five (5) tests and measures that would measure what you believe are his current GREATEST impairments given that his goal is to walk with straight cane.  Justify your selection/give sound rationale in 300 words or less.       Test   Rationale for selection

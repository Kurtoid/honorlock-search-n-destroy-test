Compose your answer as though you were preparing a presentation for junior high students regarding the world's history from 1400 - 1800, and you were only allowed to talk about three people, places, events, or ideas.  The talk is entitled, "Movers and Shakers: Three People, Places, Events, and Ideas that Changed the Early Modern World."  Choose your three and compose a paragraph for each in which you both define/describe AND explain the significance of your chosen person, place, event, or idea.  Think about a theme that unites them together, such as: women, technology, disease, warfare, politics, religion, etc.  Explain your unifying theme (what they have in common and why you chose them) in your introduction, and in your conclusion tell us what lessons we could learn from them. You will not be able to use any book or notes - the essay is part of the timed test, so be prepared to answer in about twenty minutes. OR THIS ONE (You have a choice) II.

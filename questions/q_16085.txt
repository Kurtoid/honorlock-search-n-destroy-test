At that time, he developed a cough, which was worse in the a.m. and improved throughout the day. He notes that the coff has worsened in recent days, in which he brings up occasional yellow-green sputum. He notes pain and tightness on inspiration, which can cause a bout of coughing. He denies fever, chills, or night sweats. He also denies any recent travel outside of the area and has lived here his entire life. The patient also notes a 40 pack-year history of smoking [one pack a day for 40 years], though he has not smoked in the past 5 years. He also notes that he spent some time working as a steamfitter in environments where he was exposed to chemicals that were aerosolized, as well as possibly exposed to asbestos.

The findings are consistent with diffuse bilateral interstitial pneumonia or interstitial fibrosis. The lungs are hyperinflated [inflated beyond normal limits], and there are emfysematous  changes in both upper lobes, more prominent on the right. Impression: COPD .

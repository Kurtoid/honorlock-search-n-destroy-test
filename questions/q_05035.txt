When the test scores of 500 students were analyzed, a mean score of 82 was obtained with a standard deviation of 8.  Assuming that the scores were normally distributed, how many students had scores between 66 and 98?

A wheel is shaped like a hoop, with all of the mass on the outer edge (like a bicycle wheel).  The spokes that hold the wheel to the axis at the center and the wheel hub have negligible mass.  The mass of the outer edge is m = 30 kg, and the radius is r = 5.0 m.  A cord is attached to a hub that is rhub = 2.0 m from the axis.  Force F = 700 N pulls on the wheel at the hub as shown.  The axis is fixed so that it rotates, but does not translate.  Assume no friction.  a)  Find the angular acceleration of the wheel. b)  Find the magnitude of the tangential acceleration of a point on the outer edge of the wheel.  REMEMBER to show work to camera immediately before submitting test.
The word stereotyping was first used in the Christian Bible to describe judgments made about other groups.

Please leave the "essay space" blank. While 9 pts are assigned for this question, you will use your scratch paper to answer all parts of this multi-part question. Using the bottom-most cubic frame provided on your printed scratch/worksheet of paper, schematically draw the following: Draw the location of one octahedral interstitial atom in a BCC unit cell. Use a small, dark filled-in circle as the symbol to represent the octahedral interstitial atom. Write down the coordinates of the octahedral interstitial atom you have drawn in the cube on your worksheet. (3 pts) Using small open circle symbols, now add all the nearest neighbor atoms that also serve as lattice points.  Do NOT include any lattice points in the BCC unit cell that do NOT serve as nearest neighbor atoms for your chosen octahedral interstitial atom. Now, derive the (theoretical) maximum ratio of radii between an octahedral interstitial atom and an atom positioned at a lattice point in a BCC unit cell. Show all work including neat, clear schematics to illustrate any relevant geometry relationships. (6 pts)

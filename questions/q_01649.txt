Please use the Heparin Protocol to answer the questions. WEIGHT ADJUSTED HEPARIN PROTOCOLLab Orders:  STAT: PT, INR, PTT, CBC  STAT: PTT 6 hours after any Heparin BOLUS or rate adjustment.  PTT every 6 hours until two (2) consecutive PTTs are therapeutic (46 to 70). Then change PTT to every 24 hours.

A high lactate level in blood means that the disease or condition a person has is causing lactate to accumulate. When associated with lack of oxygen, an increase in lactate can indicate that organs are not functioning properly. It is important that the athletes do an active recovery after their competitions, to avoid any organ damage due to lactate accumulation. Blood lactate levels were determined during an amateur wrestling championship. The data was collected after each match from 22 contestants (14 male and 8 female). The table presented here, reports the blood lactate level in mg/100 ml of blood for all the subjects. The data distribution is not NORMAL. Also, we can assume that the samples are independent from each other. We want to know if the median of the blood lactate levels is significantly different in male and female athletes. What type of test do you run on their data, after your analysis, what will be your interpretation?

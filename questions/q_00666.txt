Joseph Priestley conducted a series of experiments in 1771 to understand how plants grow. He first placed an unlit candle inside a sealed bell jar and lit the wick with a converging lens.  After a few minutes, the flame went out and could not be relit, even when left in the sun for 2 days.  In his next experiment, Priestley changed just one variable in the original experiment by adding a sprig of mint into the bell jar along with the candle.  He again lit the candle using the converging lens, and the candle burned out after a few minutes.  Two days later he was able to relight the candle without lifting the jar.  What did the result demonstrate?

You are trying to calculate the volume of a regularly shaped rectangular solid.  The height and width of the rectangular solid are provided in centimeters (cm).  The length measurement has been provided in feet.  If the length is given in feet as 0.250 ft, what would the length of the object be in centimeters (cm)?  Use this Metric to English Conversion:  1 meter (m) = 3.3 feet (ft) Show work for partial credit (as best you can) Report answer to proper number of significant figures.

A freight train consists of engines (mengine=100,000 kg) and cars (mcar=50,000 kg). Each engine is capable of exerting 5.00 x 105 N force on the track to accelerate the train forward. For the questions below, show in detail how you get to the solution of the problems. a) Assuming that the train is composed of 2 engines and 50 cars, what is the force of kinetic friction acting on the train? Ignore the force of drag. b) For the same train from part (a), what is the acceleration of the train? Consider that the train is already moving. Ignore the force of drag. c) Considering the drag force acting on the train, what is the terminal velocity of the train from part (a)? Do NOT ignore friction. d) If the train from part (a) is making a curve with 2.00 km of diameter at 72km/h, what is the centripetal acceleration of the train? Express the results in m/s2. e) If the train is now composed of 80 cars, what is the minimal number of engines necessary to make the train start moving? Suggestion: assume that the train is stopped, then use the static friction force of the cars to estimate the number of engines. Do NOT forget that the engines also have friction forces acting on them. Ignore the force of drag.   Useful information: The static friction coefficient between the train and the tracks is

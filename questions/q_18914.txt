5. Determine the location/orientation of the image (using ray tracing method) of an inverted object located to the left and outside the focal length of a DCV.                                         6. An isosceles prism with an apex angle of 16.10 has an index of refraction of 2.5. Determine the minimum angle of deviation for this prism.                                       7. An object is located 210-cm to the left of a DCV with a 57-cm focal length. Determine: a) Image distance; b) Magnification c) Describe the image.                                       8. A PCV lens has a focal length of 52 cm and an index of 1.893. The lens is submerged in water (1.33). Determine the values for R1 and R2. Note: The concave surface is the 1st surface.                                         9. Determine the relative aperture for a 2.5" diameter lens, knowing that the focal length is 21.5 cm. What is the effect on the focal length if the relative aperture is increase for the same diameter lens?                                         10. You are handed a CX with a radius of curvature of 46 cm and an object is placed 40 cm in front of the mirror. a) What is the focal length? b) Where is the image located (determine q)? c) Is the image found in part b) real? Explain. d) Is the image larger or smaller than the object?  What is the magnification? e) Make a ray-trace diagram to locate the position and size of the image formed.                                         11. A two-lens system is made up of a diverging lens followed by a converging lens, each of focal length 250 mm. The system is used to form an image of an object 95 mm high, standing erect, 720 mm from the first lens. The two lenses are separated by a distance of 80 cm. Describe the image formed by this system.

Last month, Lloyd's Systems analyzed the project whose cash flows are shown below. However, before the decision to accept or reject the project, the Federal Reserve took actions that changed interest rates and therefore the firm's WACC. The Fed's action did not affect the forecasted cash flows. By how much did the change in the WACC affect the project's forecasted NPV? Note that a project's projected NPV can be negative, in which case it should be rejected.      Old WACC:   10.00%     New WACC:   9.50%     Year   0       1     2     3       Cash flows   -$1,000   $410   $410   $410

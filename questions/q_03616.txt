[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).] Two boxes are sliding toward each other on a frictionless surface.  Box A has a mass of 5.00 kg and is moving to the right at 3.00 m/s prior to the collision.  Box B has a mass of 4.00 kg.  After the collision, Box A is moving to the left at 2.00 m/s and Box B is moving to the left at 0.500 m/s.  The force of Box A on Box B is determined to be 250 N.   a) Draw a diagram of the initial state and another diagram of the final state and determine the initial velocity of Box B.  [Enter this velocity below.  You will scan and submit the diagrams and your work after the quiz] b) Briefly describe how you could determine, numerically, whether the above collision was elastic or inelastic. [enter your description below] c) Determine the impulse on Box A (caused by Box B).  [enter the numerical answer below; submit work after quiz] d) Using impulse/momentum principles, determine how long the collision lasts.  [enter the numerical answer below; submit work after quiz] You will scan your work for parts a, c, and d of this problem and submit it immediately following the quiz.

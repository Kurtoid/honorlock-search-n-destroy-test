BONUS - 15 points The amount of ascorbic acid (FM 176.12) in a sample can be determined by iodometric titration. A 10.00-mL aliquot of a solution with an unknown ascorbic acid concentration was first pipetted into an Erlenmeyer flask, along with 5 mL of 5% KI solution and 1.5 mL of 6 M H2SO4. The mixture was then titrated rapidly with 1.897 mM KIO3 solution while swirling the flask between additions, until the yellow color of the  complex almost persisted. Then four drops of starch indicator were added and the titration continued until the blue color of the starch-iodine complex persisted. The total amount of KIO3 solution used was 38.72 mL.  Report the ascorbic acid concentration in mg ascorbic acid/100 mL solution. IO3- + 8I- + 6H+  3I3- + 3H2O Ascorbic acid + I3- + H2O  dehydroascorbate + 3I- + 2H+

A child has clarithromycin ordered for an infection caused by Haemophilus Influenzaecomplex. The order is for 7.5 mg/kg/dose PO twice daily (BID). The child weighs 74 pounds. How many milligrams should the nurse administer for one dose?  Record your answer to the hundredth place. The nurse has an oral suspension of 125 mg/5 mL of clarithromycin. How many milliliters would the nurse give per dose?  Record the answer to the tenth place. The child is being discharged with the remaining doses to be given at home.  The child's mom asks how many teaspoons she should give with each dose.  How many teaspoons per dose would you tell the parent if the medication is dosed 125mg/5 mL?  Record your answer as a whole number.  Give only one answer. Give the answer to the last question.
What is the name of the floor plan below?

Some superficial mycoses are called ________.
Which of the following statements is true of pan-Indianism?
Part 3: Short Answer (4 questions, 5 points each) For each short answer question, please be sure to make clear and direct references to concepts, terms, and paradigms from the textbook and class. Each of your responses should include specific references to the course material. Short answer question responses have no word minimum or maximum, and will be graded based upon the completeness of the response and the accurate explanation and application of specific terms and concepts covered in the course.

7. What is the loss caused by core-diameter mismatch when going from a single-mode step-index fiber with 9 um core to a graded-index multimode fiber with 50-um core?                                         8. A network transmits data through a 50/125-um fiber that is connected into an 8/125-um fiber of a second network. Determine the loss caused by the mismatch in the fibers.                                                 9. A 1X12 coupler has output signals of -26.99 dBm at every port. If the input signal is 0.3 mW what is its excess loss?                                         10. A bidirectional coupler (see figure below), has a CR of 11.47 dB. If P1 = 2.3 mW and P2 = 0.5 mW, and P3 = 0.145 mW. Calculate the values for P4, DL, EL, and IL.                                           11. The end reflection loss depends on the difference between the refractive indexes of the material in the gap and the glass (n = 1.47). If you have water with refractive index of 1.33 in the gap, what is the Fresnel (reflection) loss for this fiber-to-fiber connection?                                         12. A coupler splits an input signal between two ports with a 70/30 ratio. If the input signal is -0.075 dBu and the coupler has no excess loss, what is the output (in dBu) at the port receiving the larges signal?                                         13. You are transferring light from a fiber 52.5/125-um graded-index with NA=0.29 to a fiber 40/150-um step-index fiber with NA=0.36. Determine the total loss for this fiber-to-fiber connection.                                         14. The space between two pieces of fiber (60/140-um) was filled with epoxy (n = 1.545). Knowing that the space was 10 um long and the fiber's NA = 0.34, determine the loss.

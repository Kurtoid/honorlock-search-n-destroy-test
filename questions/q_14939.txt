Problem No. 1 A built-up shape is made by welding plates to make a I-shape shown below.. The dimensions are b=12-in, h1= 20-in, t=0.5-in and h=21.5-in. The allowable flexural stress sigma_allowable =30 ksi and allowable shear stress tau_allowable = 18 ksi. Based on this information answer the following question: Question 1.6: If the allowable shear force  Vmax =170-kip, what will be the required total weld strength per length between the web and the flange? [Enter value in kips and in as appropriate: HINT consider shear flow].

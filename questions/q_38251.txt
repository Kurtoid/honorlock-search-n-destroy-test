A block of mass m kg is held against a spring with a constant of k1 N/m. The spring has been compressed by a distance d1 meters. Some distance in front of it, along a rough surface, is another spring with a spring constant of k2 N/m. The block is released and it slides into the second spring, compressing it. If W Joules of energy is lost to friction while the block slides toward the second spring, by how much is the second spring compressed? Answer in meters.

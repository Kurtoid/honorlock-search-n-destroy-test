The value of the DHdeg for the decomposition reaction of liquid methanol (molar mass: 32.04 g/mol) to carbon monoxide gas (molar mass: 28.01 g/mol) and hydrogen gas (molar mass: 2.02 g/mol) is +128.1 kJ.  The balanced chemical reaction is: CH3OH (l) - CO (g) + 2H2 (g). Determine the absolute value of heat (in kJ) that will be released/absorbed by the reaction when 5.10 g of hydrogen gas is formed.

Imagine that you are studying a very large population of moths that is isolated from gene flow. A single gene controls wing color. Half of the moths have white-spotted wings (genotype WW or Ww), and half of the moths have plain brown wings (ww). There are no new mutations, individuals mate randomly, and there is no natural selection on wing color. How will p, the frequency of the dominant allele, change over time?

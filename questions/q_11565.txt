Sequence Diagram Exercise (10 points): Develop Sequence Diagram for the following scenario. When a borrower requests for checkout of media, the librarian begins the checkout process by entering the borrower's identification information in the library system. The borrower is located and verified to be valid. For each of the media copy, the librarian then enters media copy information in the library system. Once the media copy is located, the library system then processes that item (i.e., media copy). This process is repeated at the library system for each media copy. During this process, if the number of items exceeds the limit for that borrower, the library system informs the librarian of the same. The librarian checks out only the allowed number of copies to the borrower. If the limit is not exceeded, the library system informs the librarian of the same, and all the requested copies are checked out to the borrower.

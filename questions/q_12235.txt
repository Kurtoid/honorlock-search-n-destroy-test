Module 06 - Emotion Regulation: Question: Cyntrice's consultant is implementing a ______ strategy during post-performance contexts. Cyntrice's Affect Regulation Back Story: Cyntrice, the Bantamweight Mixed Martial Artist (MMA) and her coach recently hired a Sport Psychology Consultant to help her achieve an optimal affective state during pre-performance, active performance, and post-performance contexts. The Sport Psychology Consultant proposed the following interventions:  Pre-performance: During multiple sessions in an office and in the gym, Cyntrice's consultant instructs her to think of her upcoming performance as opportunities to demonstrate her elite skill set, her focused anger, and opportunistic power. Instead of Cyntrice thinking of her anger as a source of unlimited power and energy, her consultant wants her to think of her anger as only being effective when it is directed towards a focused cause. Active-performance: Over several weeks, Cyntrice's consultant has her coach increase the similarity of training sessions to an actual competitive bout. Importantly, the consultant wants these sessions to increase Cyntrice's exposure to a higher volume and higher intensity of anger inducing stimuli.  Post-performance: Cyntrice's consultant sets up equipment that will measure Cyntrice's heart-rate, respiration rate, and cortisol levels. The consultant provides the data to Cyntrice and wants her to use this information to work on actively controlling her arousal level; calming herself down in the moments immediately following a performance and throughout her recovery period.

After reading the poem below, answer the following question: Where does Tom Dacre dream the various chimney sweepers are kept? The Chimney Sweeper    By William Blake     When my mother died I was very young, And my father sold me while yet my tongue Could scarcely cry " 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!" So your chimneys I sweep & in soot I sleep. There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved, so I said, "Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare, You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair." And so he was quiet, & that very night, As Tom was a-sleeping he had such a sight! That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, & Jack, Were all of them locked up in coffins of black; And by came an Angel who had a bright key, And he opened the coffins & set them all free; Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing they run, And wash in a river and shine in the Sun. Then naked & white, all their bags left behind, They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind. And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy, He'd have God for his father & never want joy. And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark And got with our bags & our brushes to work. Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm; So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.

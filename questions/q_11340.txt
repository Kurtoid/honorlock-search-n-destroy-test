Orders can be received over phone, fax, mail, or email. When an order is received, it is reviewed for availability of items against in-stock inventory. If items are unavailable, the customer is contacted. The order may then be revised (i.e., the customer modifies the order to what is available) or cancelled (i.e., the customer decides to cancel). Upon cancellation, the sales representative purges the order. The orders with all items available and the revised orders are sent to the warehouse. The content of each order is verified at the warehouse. Orders are then packaged at the warehouse. Simultaneously, a packaging slip is prepared for that order. The order is shipped when it's packaged and the packaging slip is prepared. The accounting department receives a copy of the packaging slip, which it uses to prepare an invoice. This invoice is then sent to the customer. Once the customer pays the invoice amount, the accounting department closes the order.

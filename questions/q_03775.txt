Use this copy of the HONORLOCK ROOM SCAN INSTRUCTIONS to answer the below questions Room Scan Instructions for Honorlock Proctoring The purpose of the room scan is to insure that the same testing environment requirements for an on-campus Test or Exam are being met at the student testing location.   The room must be well lit, the speed of the camera movement must be slow enough, and the video quality must be high enough so that the instructor can clearly identify what is in the room and what is on or under the desk or table at which the test will be taken on The scan must show the entire room as well as the entire desk or table at which the test or exam will be taken  Students are advised to view the How to Conduct a Proper Room Scan video from Honorlock for a visual explanation of a proper room scan. Students will have an opportunity to practice this and receive instructor feedback during the Orientation and Honorlock Quiz (O&HL Quiz). When the instructor reviews a student's room scan for a proctoring session they must be able to confirm that:  No other persons are in the room No notes or other course related materials are on the walls or within reaching distance of the desk or table at which the test or exam will be taken The desk or table on which the Test or Exam will be taken is free of prohibited items specified in the Honorlock Standard Testing Guidelines.

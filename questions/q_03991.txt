From Beowulf The hero observed that swamp-thing from hell, The tarn-hag in all her terrible strength, Then heaved his war-sword and swung his arm:            1520 The decorated blade came down ringing And singing on her head.  But he soon found His battle-torch extinguished: the shinning blade Refused to bite.  It spared her and failed The man in his need.  It had gone through many Hand-to-hand fights, had hewed the armor And helmets of the doomed, but here at last The fabulous powers of that heirloom failed. Hygelac's  kinsman  kept  thinking  about His name and fame: he never lost heart.                 1530 Then, in fury, he flung his sword away. The keen, inlaid, worm-looped-patterned steel Was hurled to the ground: he would have to rely On the might of his arm.  So must a man do Who intends to gain enduring glory In a combat.  Life  doesn't  cost  him   thought. Then the prince of War-Geats, warming to his fight   With  Grendel's  mother, gripped her shoulder And laid about him in a battle frenzy: He pitched his killer opponent to the floor                     1540 But she rose quickly and retaliated, Grappled him tightly in her grim embrace. The sure-footed fight fell daunted, The strongest of warriors stumbled and fell. So she pounced upon him and pulled out A broad, whetted knife: now she could avenge Her only child.  But the mesh of chain-mail On  Beowulf's  shoulder  shielded  his  life, Turned the edge and tip of the blade. The son of Ecgtheow would surely have perished          1550 And the Geats lost their warrior under the wide earth Had the strong links and locks of his war-gear Not helped to save him: Holy God Decided the victory.  It was easy for the Lord, The Ruler of Heaven, to redress the balance Once Beowulf got back up on his feet.     From Lanval  The king had been hunting in the wood; He'd had a fine day, his mood was good, But when he came inside the door Of his wife's rooms, she fell on the floor At his feet and vehemently cried For justice. She claimed Lanval had tried To win her to his heart's desire, And being rejected, in his ire Insulted her, boasted he had won The love of such a peerless one, So fine and proud that he'd consider The least of the women serving her To surpass the queen in quality. The king was so enraged that he On his most solemn oath then swore That Lanval would appear before The court, and if he couldn't deny The accusation, he would die Hanged or at the stake. The king Rushed from the room, and summoning Three of his barons, sent them for   Lanval, who had no need of more Misfortune, as he mourned the cost Of his betrayal: he had lost The happiness that he had known. He stayed in a room, all alone, Calling and calling to his dear Love, but she did not appear, No matter how many times he tried; It's a wonder he did not decide To kill himself. She was pitiless. Sometimes he lost all consciousness But came sighing back to life again, Weeping bitterly, and then He would plead for mercy, cry aloud In anguish, begging to be allowed To hear her speak. When nothing reversed His harsh punishment, Lanval cursed Himself, cursed his mouth, which had spoken Thoughtlessly; the promise broken By no means would she forgive, And then, alas, how could he live?     From "The Miller's Tale" Whan that the firste cok hathe crowe, anonUp rist this joly lovere Absolon,And hym arraieth gay, at poynt-devys.But first he cheweth greyn and lycorys,To smellen sweete, er he hadde kembd his heer.Under his tonge a trewe-love he beer,For therby wende he to ben gracious.He rometh to the carpenteres hous,And stille he stant under the shot-wyndowe -Unto his brest it raughte, it was so lowe -And softe he cougheth with a semy soun:  "What do ye, hony-comb, sweete Alisoun,My faire bryd, my sweete cynamome?Awaketh, lemman myn, and speketh to me!Wel lithel thynken ye upon me wo,That for youre love I swete ther I go.No wonder is thogh that I swelte and swete;I moorne as dooth a lamb after the tete.Ywis, lemman, I have swich love-longynge,That lik a turtel trewe is my moornynge.I may nat ete na moore than a mayde."    From Othello OTHELLO Yes, presently:Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;For to deny each article with oathCannot remove nor choke the strong conceptionThat I do groan withal. Thou art to die. DESDEMONA Then Lord have mercy on me! OTHELLO I say, amen. DESDEMONA And have you mercy too! I never didOffend you in my life; never loved CassioBut with such general warranty of heavenAs I might love: I never gave him token. OTHELLO By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,And makest me call what I intend to doA murder, which I thought a sacrifice:I saw the handkerchief. DESDEMONA He found it then;I never gave it him: send for him hither;Let him confess a truth. OTHELLO He hath confess'd. DESDEMONA What, my lord? OTHELLO That he hath used thee. DESDEMONA How? unlawfully?   OTHELLO Ay. DESDEMONA He will not say so. OTHELLO No, his mouth is stopp'd;Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't. DESDEMONA O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead? OTHELLO Had all his hairs been lives, my great revengeHad stomach for them all. DESDEMONA Alas! he is betray'd and I undone. OTHELLO Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face? DESDEMONA O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not! OTHELLO Down, strumpet! DESDEMONA Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night! OTHELLO Nay, if you strive-- DESDEMONA But half an hour! OTHELLO Being done, there is no pause. DESDEMONA But while I say one prayer! OTHELLO It is too late. He stifles her

The new welder will be much more efficient, however, and this enhanced efficiency will increase earnings before depreciation from $25,000 to $66,500 per year. The new machine will be depreciated over its 5-year MACRS recovery period, so the applicable depreciation rates are 20.00%, 32.00%, 19.20%, 11.52%, 11.52%, and 5.76%.

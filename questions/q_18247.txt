Op-amp U1 & U2  Use myDAQ's oscilloscope to capture the input waveform Vin (on Channel 0) and the final output waveform Vout2 (on Channel 1) superimposed. Set the amplitude scale of the oscilloscope for Channel 0 to 500 mV/Div, and for Channel 1 to 2 V/Div.  Set the time scale of the oscilloscope to 500 us/Div      Take a screenshot of the oscilloscope (both waveform in the same picture) and embed the screenshot as the answer for this question.  Report the value of Vin(p-p) and Vout2(p-p) observed from the oscilloscope.  Calculate the experimemtal Gaintotal=?

Problem 1: Model 1 In the following regression models, data provided by Road & Track Sports & GT Cars were used to relate CurbWeight - curb weight (lb.), engine type, transmission type, ZeroTo60 - time to go from 0 to 60 mph (seconds), TopSpeed-highestspeed (mph), and HorsePower -horse power to speed at  1/4  mile (mph) for 29 sports and GT cars. To incorporate engine type and transmission type into the regression model, the following dummy variables were defined:  In the first model, CurbWeight, EngineType, TransmissionType, and TopSpeed were used as independent variables with speed at  1/4  mile being the dependent variable. The following table shows the Excel output for this model (refer to this output as model 1).  Referring to the information given above, answer the following question Write the regression equation based on the given results.

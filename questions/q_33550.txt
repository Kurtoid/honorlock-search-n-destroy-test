Questions 18-26 refer to the following passage from a longer article.     Title of Article: "Too Many Colleges Are Still in Denial about Alcohol Abuse"   Authors: Henry Wechsler, Charles Deutsch, and George Dowdall     Title of Periodical: Chronicle of Higher Education   Volume/Issue: Volume 41, Issue 31     Date of Publication: April 14, 1995   Page numbers: Bl- B2     Database: Academic Search Complete   Access Date: August 17, 2013     URL: http://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/ioanna.panos/engl1301-165- 166/unit-3b-binge-drinking-college/too-many-colleges-are-still-in- denial-about-alcohol-abuse-wechsler-et-al/view             Colleges have a serious problem with alcohol abuse among students, and it's not getting any better. Binge drinking - defined as the heavy, episodic use of alcohol - has persisted on campuses despite both a general decrease in alcohol consumption among Americans and an increase in the number of abstainers. Some people (including the author of a recent front-page article in the New York Times) have assumed that the latter two trends have translated into more moderate drinking on the campuses. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our recent research, which received support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was the only largescale study to date of the extent and consequences of binge drinking at a representative sample of American colleges and universities. Our detailed findings from surveys of 17,592 students at 140 randomly selected four-year colleges were published in the December 7, 1994, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association . . . . Our study found that 44 percent of all students in the sample were binge drinkers - 50 percent of the men and 39 percent of the women. Which of the following sentences is correctly documented and avoids plagiarism?

Division S of ABC Company makes a part that it sells to other companies. Data on that part appear below:       Selling price on the intermediate market   $30 per unit     Variable costs per unit   $22 per unit     Fixed costs per unit (based on capacity)   $7 per unit     Capacity in units   50,000 units     Division B, another division of ABC Company, presently is purchasing 10,000 units of a similar product each period from an outside supplier for $28 per unit, but would like to begin purchasing from Division S. Suppose that Division S has ample idle capacity to handle all of Division B's needs without any increase in fixed costs or cutting into sales to outside customers. If Division S refuses to accept a transfer price of $28 or less and Division B continues to buy from the outside supplier, the company as a whole will:

For the function f(x)=x2-12x+36{"version":"1.1","math":"f(x)=x2-12x+36"} , use the Second Derivative Test (and no other method) to determine if the function has a relative maximum or relative minimum at its critical number, x = 6.    Since the way you work the problem is the MOST important thing for this problem, you must make sure to upload your work for this problem to the Dropbox folder "Work for Test #3".   Answer:  The function has  _______________________   at its critical number x = 6. Write "a relative maximum" or "a relative minimum"; if the Second Derivative Test is inconclusive, instead write "inconclusive" (even though that doesn't work the way the sentence is structured).

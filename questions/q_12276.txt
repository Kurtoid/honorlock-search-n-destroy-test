A constant-time implementation computes an RSA signature as s=xd mod m, where the attacker knows the message x, the modulus m (which is part of the public key), and the correct value of the signature s for this message. The program code for this modular exponentiation is as follows: 1   s=BN_one();                                        // s=1;2   for(b=bits-1;b

Repeated for your convenience:Pique Corporation wants to purchase a new machine for $400,000. Management predicts that the machine can produce additional incremental cash sales of $300,000 each year for the next 5 years. The relevant incremental cash expenses are expected to include direct materials, direct labor, and factory overhead (excluding depreciation) totaling $150,000 per year. The firm uses straight-line depreciation with no residual value for all depreciable assets. Pique's combined marginal income tax rate is 30%.Management requires a minimum after-tax rate of return (i.e., discount rate) of 10% on all investments.Q5: What is the net present value (NPV) of the investment? (The PV annuity factor for 5 years, 10% is 3.791.) Assume that the cash inflows occur at year-end.

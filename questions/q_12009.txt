Long Answer: Write 6-8 sentences (one-two small paragraphs). This prompt has multiple questions in order to help you quickly brainstorm and address the issue from different angles. Answering each one will help you arrive at a complete answer quickly; however, some of the questions flow into each other, so focus on the complete idea as you write.   Compare the two young women of "Goblin Market" (Lizzie and Laura) to the woman in the "Lady of Shalott." (You can refer to her as Elaine or Lady Elaine since that is the name of her character in the Arthurian legends.) How do Christina Rossetti's and Alfred, Lord Tennyson's characters' behavior reinforce OR subvert Victorian ideals? Use the Woman Question and the Angel of the House as the reference point here for defining the Victorian ideals for women.   To fully answer this question, you should decide if Lizzie and Laura's actions reinforce OR subvert Victorian ideals. Then, you should decide if Lady Elaine's actions reinforce OR subvert Victorian ideals. Then, compare (or contrast) each.  Reference minor plot points as evidence to support your answer. You may want to consider both initial actions from the beginning or middle of the poems, but you may also was to consider the endings for each poem too.    This is probably the hardest question on the test, so I'd recommend reading through the prompt again. Please note, there isn't a "correct answer" for whether the characters reinforce or subvert Victorian ideals. Many scholars have successfully argued both sides of this question. What I'm looking for from you is that you are making a claim based on your reading and analysis of the poem.

What I Remember About the Weekend President Kennedy Was Assassinated.   It was a sunny and beautiful day, November 22, 1963. The air was chilled with a slight breeze, but there wasn't a cloud in the sky. For almost everyone on the earth there was no anxiety or fear of an unexpected tragedy. It was a normal Friday and everyone went about their business as usual, but the day was brought to an abrupt standstill.   Our class was in math our sixth period class. We were in the middle of the test when a neighboring teacher came in and handed our math teacher a note. A sudden expression of horror filled her face. She followed the other teacher into the hall, leaving us unattended. I began to feel uneasy and quite nervous when the teacher returned. She had a look of utter disbelief and shock on her face. At once the thought of another World War came into my head. I got very fidgety and was distracted from my work on the test. For the next five minutes or so she just sat staring into space. Then she stood up and kind of moped around the classroom watching us. Almost immediately after she stood up the test was discontinued. There was a piercing silence in the room as we passed forward our papers. I think we all knew something was wrong. Then she told us the horrible and tragedy filled event. "The President had been killed." I was standing almost frozen stiff with shock and disbelief. Presently I began to move again and I found my seat. The school was dismissed very shortly. We all moved in silence back to our homeroom where we gathered our books and coats. The halls in school were never so quiet. We went home and tried to console ourselves but it was too much. Most of us cried. I shed one tear I couldn't allow myself to cry although I certainly felt like it.   That whole weekend you were glued to the television. It showed from the tragic moment until his casket was lowered into the ground. I never felt so empty in all my life. I felt as if he was one of the family. Never could such a thing happen I said to myself. It's just impossible.   I'm Catholic so Monday night our church had a Mass said for him. When I walked into church and saw the imposter casket sitting in the middle of the aisle I almost died. I sunk to my knees.   From that Black day to this day I still can't bring myself to really believe deeply inside my heart what had happened that day President Kennedy was assassinated.          * In most funeral masses the casket holding the body of the dead person remains in front of the congregation during the service. Here an empty casket symbolized Kennedy's death.

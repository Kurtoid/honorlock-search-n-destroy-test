Click on the blue button to open the image              When the Romans came to Britain, they brought their way of life with them. The Romans built towns that were often protected by walls and there was everything a citizen of Roman Britain would need inside - houses, shops, meeting spaces, workshops, temples and bathhouses.                 They also built grand country houses called 'villas'. These had many rooms, some with beautifully painted walls, mosaic floors and even central heating. Houses           Click on the blue button to open the image             Most of Roman Britain was a wild place, with forests and mountains where few people lived.   People mainly lived in small villages of wooden houses with thatched roofs, much as they had before the Romans arrived.   However, some wealthy Romans lived in villas and palaces. Villas were large farms with a big house for the owners. They had lots of servants and farmworkers to help run the villa.

Another palace was beside the sea, at Fishbourne (near Chichester in West Sussex).                 Families Men oversaw the family in Roman Britain. Mothers were thought to be less important than fathers. Women were expected to run the home, cook meals and raise children.                  Slaves often did this work, too.                 Many girls were married at the age of 14. Marriages were often arranged between families.  Many women died young (in their 30s) because childbirth could be dangerous, and diseases were common.

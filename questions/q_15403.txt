Residents of Spain and most Latin American countries usually have two last names (dos apellidos): the first one is inherited from the father, and the second one from the mother. The first of these names, the paternal family name, is considered primary, and is the one passed on to future generations. For example, when we look at the name of Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal we know that Garcia is his father's family name (that is, inherited from his father), and Bernal is his mother's family name (that is, inherited from his mother). When Gael Garcia Bernal and Argentine actress Dolores Fonzi (with only one family name, from her father, because her family is Italian) had a son, they named him Lazaro Garcia Fonzi. Their daughter is Libertad Garcia Fonzi. PASO 2:  Match the phrases [the mother (madre) or father (padre) of a particular person] with [that parent's FULL NAME].  The parents have all been labelled as a mom or a dad so you don't have to guess at genders.

I understand the following rules:   My work needs to lead me to the answer that was recorded on the quiz. If it doesn't I will lose all credit and could be questioned about cheating since this is suspicious behavior.   I know I am not allowed to use outside resources on this (or any) quiz, other than desmos. My instructor was nice enough to allow desmos, so I should not abuse his trust. I understand that if I do use online resources, this could result in a grade of (0), a report filed with the college, and/or possibly being told to withdraw from the course with a grade of F due to academic honesty.  When I submit my work pages after completing the quiz, they are to be in ONE FILE in PDF format. I realize that this was clearly communicated with me since the beginning of the quarter and if I do not adhere to this rule, my work pages may not be counted.

Given a phrase of any length, write a program to shift the alphabet (ASCII) value of only the last letter of every word by -5 (5 letter backwards).  For example: if the phrase = 'aaaF  Bbb  cxwY  Yabd  EPWZ', then new phrase should shift only the last letter of every word by 5 numbers backwards. So the new phrase is 'aaaA Bbw cxwT Yaby EPWU'. The last letter 'F' in phrase is changed to 'A' and similarly other last letters of all the words in the phrase are also changed.  Test Case 1:Input:  'aaaF Bbb cxwY Yabd EPWZ'Output: 'aaaA Bbw cxwT Yaby EPWU' Test Case 2:Input:  'Apples are very sweet!'Output: 'Applen arz vert sweeo!' Note: The letters can be in uppercase or in lowercase or both.  phrase = input('Enter the phrase:  ', 's');

Enterprises are increasingly relying on Cloud services (e.g., Amazon AWS) for a variety of reasons. In this question, we want to explore storage and processing of data that may have mandatory access control requirements. Assume authentication and authorization is correctly implemented in a public cloud environment where resources are shared among multiple applications that could belong to different tenants who compete with each other (e.g., two banks). Answer the following questions for this system.  The Cloud service shares and dynamically allocates its processing and storage resources across all tenants. A covert channel can be established in this system by an application belonging to one tenant to send proprietary data to an application of another tenant. Give an example of how such a channel could be established. (5 pts.)  Is this a timing or storage covert channel? Explain your answer. (5 pts.)  Will the covert channel be noisy? Explain your answer. (2 pts.)  (a) If a covert channel is a concern in such a system, how can operators of the Cloud service mitigate the problem and reduce the risk of the covert channel? (5 pts)(b) Could the pump be used for such mitigation? Explain your answer. (3 pts.)  Are covert channels a concern in SELinux? Explain your answer. (5 pts.)  The security context of a process P in SELinux has the following label for its multi-level security (MLS) part of the context: s0..s15, c0..c1023. True or false: If discretionary access control and type enforcement permissions are granted, P can read any file in the system. You must either explain why a read will be allowed or give reasons why access may be denied. (5 pts.)

IQ is normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.   Suppose one individual is randomly chosen.   Let X = IQ of an individual. Fill in the blanks: X ~ [n]([m],[s]) Find the probability that the person has an IQ between 110 and 120. Round to 4 decimal places. [p] Find the 80th percentile. Round to 1 decimal place. [t]

A battery is connected to the capacitor circuit shown below providing a potential difference of 215 V. The capacitor values are all in microfarads.    a) Find the equivalent capacitance for the capacitor circuit. b) How much energy is provided by the battery for the capacitors in this circuit? c) Calculate the charge on the 222 mF capacitor. d) What is the potential difference across the 57 mF cap? e) Calculate the energy stored by the 107 mF capacitor. part a) What is the equivalent capacitance for       10. The figure above shows the circuit simplified with the equivalent values for the original circuit. Simplify the circuit one stage further and enter the values for each letter shown  in the figure below. Round each capacitance to 3 decimal places and do not include units. Be sure to use the values given above.    H= ?

A client is diagnosed with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following administration of nephrotoxic drugs.  The nurse understands the client has developed which type of acute kidney injury?
A state transition relationship is called symmetric if it takes the same (or comparable) time to transition between two states (i.e., the transition time between state A and state B is the same as the transition time between B and A). In the context of dynamic power management for StrongARM processor with three states (RUN, IDLE and SLEEP), identify one symmetric relationship and one asymmetric relationship.

(4.0 pts)(NWR) Four traveling waves are described by the following equations, where all quantities are measured in SI units and y represents the displacement. I: y = 0.12 cos(3x - 21t) II: y = 0.15 sin(6x + 42t) III: y = 0.13 cos(6x + 21t) IV: y = -0.27 sin(3x - 42t)Which of these waves have the same period?

Re-read the following article and answer the questions that follow. By studying stars of different ages, we have learned that the early universe contained only the simplest chemical elements hydrogen and helium (and a trace amount of lithium). We and the Earth are made primarily of "other" elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and iron. Where did these other elements come from? Astronomers have discovered that all of these elements were manufactured by massive stars. . . In summary, most of the material from which we and our planet are made was created inside stars that died before the birth of our Sun. We are intimately connected to the stars because we are products of stars. In the words of astronomer Carl Sagan, we are "star stuff." (Adapted from Bennett, Donahue, Schneider, and Voit, The Cosmic Perspective, pp. 6, 8) What is the topic of this selection?

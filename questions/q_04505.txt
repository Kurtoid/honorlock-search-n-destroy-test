In this problem you are to assume that you are the designer of a 3 phase induction motor and therefore have the ability to change or specify the equivalent circuit parameters, Rs, Rr', (Xls+ Xlr'), and Xm, of a given machine.  For each of the modifications below, state only one (the most important) parameter you would change to achieve the desired effect.  You must justify your answer and state whether you would make the value higher or lower.  Note that (Xls + Xlr') is to be considered as a single parameter.           You should use any of the approximations we discussed in class.    To increase the efficiency. To decrease the starting current. To increase the speed range of the constant kVA region of the capability curve. To increase the speed range for a drive which operates only with variable stator voltage control. To decrease the no load current.

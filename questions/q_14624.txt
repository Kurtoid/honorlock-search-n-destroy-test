HR process efficiency focuses on how well HR departments accomplish critical HRM processes that support organizational effectiveness.
If everyone acted as free riders, there would be more interest groups and problems would be solved more quickly.
A patient was admitted to the 7th floor of ORMC hospital suffering from an unknown bacterial infection.    The samples collected from the patient were sent to a hospital laboratory, located on the 2nd floor, equipped to grow and isolate bacteria, like Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella, associated with human diseases that can be treated or for which a vaccine exists.   After subculturing the samples, the original culture was discarded in the sink. Staining and biochemical tests were done to identify the bacteria. Within a week of initial sample collection, several patients located on the 1st and 2nd floors displayed signs and symptoms like the first patient.     Based on the information, determine the probable cause of the outbreak.[option1] Determine the biosafety level of the hospital's microbiology lab. [option2]

Consider the concentric spherical conductors arranged as shown in the figure below. Each of the dimensions for the conductors are given in terms of the length a. Assume the cavity between the conductors is initially a vacuum. Clearly justify all of your answers to the following questions.    a) Calculate the capacitance for the arrangement of conductors shown in the figure. Your answer should be written in terms of a number and a. b) For the rest of this problem use a = 0.0022 m. Calculate the capacitance of the spherical conductors for a = 0.0022 m. c) A 28 V battery is connected between the inner and outer conductors. How much charge develops on each of the conductor surfaces? While the battery is connected to the capacitor, the vacuum seal starts to leak filling the cavity with a gas that increases the permittivity to 2.08x10-10 C2/Nm2.  Answer the following questions concerning the effect of the dielectric. d) How much energy is stored by the capacitor with a dielectric? e) What is the new charge on the conductors? f) Now the battery is disconnected from the capacitor. If the dielectric gas is removed from in between the conductors, then calculate how much energy is now stored by the capacitor? part a) E = 8.992 x109 4. Now calculate the potential difference between the inner and outer conductors. Your answer should be a number times Q/a, so just put the number in scientific notation and type in  the coefficient, rounding to 3 decimal places. Take the absolute value so you have a positive number.

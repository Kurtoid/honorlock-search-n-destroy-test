1. Country H and Country J are both members of the WTO. Country H's domestic law currently provides for a uniform tariff of 4 percent for most imports. Country H's trade concessions negotiated in the last round of the WTO trade negotiations contain tariff schedules that substantially exceed 4 percent for certain products. As a result, H is permitted under the WTO ceilings to impose tariffs that are higher than the 4 percent tariff that H would normally apply under its domestic law to imports. Country H has recently decided to raise the tariff rate on imports to the maximum allowed under its WTO ceilings. This means that with respect to many products exported by Country J to Country H, the tariff rate will suddenly be raised, in some cases substantially. Does Country J have a legitimate claim of a "benefit?" If so, is there a "nullification or impairment?" Lastly, is this an example of a "violation" or "non-violation" case?

Part 1 (Semi-Join and Anti-Join in SQL) [10 points] SQL has native operators (keywords) for the Relational Algebra operators  (join) and [?] (outer join). For instance, given the table schemas (data types omitted) Employee(Name, EmpId, DeptName)Department(DeptName, Manager) we can, for example, write the queries SELECT * FROM Employee e JOIN Department d ON e.DeptName = d.DeptName;SELECT * FROM Employee NATURAL JOIN Department;SELECT * FROM Employee e FULL OUTER JOIN Department d ON e.DeptName = d.DeptName;SELECT * FROM Employee NATURAL FULL OUTER JOIN Department; Unfortunately, there are no operators (keywords) in SQL for the Relational Algebra operators [?] ((left) semi-join) and > ((left) anti-join). Taking the two table schemas and the queries from above as an example, provide two different simulations or "implementations" of each of these two operators in SQL (4 SQL queries in total). In other words, write two different SQL queries to simulate each of the two non-existing semi-join and anti-join operators in SELECT * FROM Employee e SEMI JOIN Department d ON e.DeptName = d.DeptName;SELECT * FROM Employee NATURAL SEMI JOIN Department;SELECT * FROM Employee e ANTI JOIN Department d ON e.DeptName = d.DeptName;SELECT * FROM Employee NATURAL ANTI JOIN Department;

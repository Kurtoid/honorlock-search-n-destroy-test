A MT processor that allows instruction from 2 threads to be run concurrently,  has two functional units, only instructions from a single thread can be issued to run on any cycle. Assume we have two threads X and Y to run on these CPUs that include the following operations:     Thread X   Thread Y     A1 - take 3 cycles to execute A2 - Depends on the results of A1 A3 - no dependences takes 3 cycles to execute A4 - conflicts for a functional unit with A1   B1 - takes 4 cycles to execute B2 - conflicts for a functional unit with B1 B3 -no dependences and takes 2 cycles to execute  B4 - Depends on the result of B2     Assume all instructions take a single cycle to execute unless noted otherwise or they encounter a hazard.  Assume you have one MT CPU, how many cycle it takes to execute these two threads? How many issue slots are wasted due to hazards?

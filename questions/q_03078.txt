Provided that the absorptivity of NADH at 340 nm is 6440 L mol-1 cm-1, the absorbance will be observed when light at 340nm passes through a 1 cm cuvette containing 10 mM NADH and 10 mM NAD is ............ where NAD does not absorb at 340 nm.

Problem 1: Model 1 In the following regression models, data provided by Road & Track Sports & GT Cars were used to relate CurbWeight - curb weight (lb.), engine type, transmission type, ZeroTo60 - time to go from 0 to 60 mph (seconds), TopSpeed-highestspeed (mph), and HorsePower -horse power to speed at  1/4  mile (mph) for 29 sports and GT cars. To incorporate engine type and transmission type into the regression model, the following dummy variables were defined:  In the first model, CurbWeight, EngineType, TransmissionType, and TopSpeed were used as independent variables with speed at  1/4  mile being the dependent variable. The following table shows the Excel output for this model (refer to this output as model 1).  Referring to the information given above, answer the following question Are the individual variables "TransmissionType" and  "TopSpeed (mph)" significant (Use a=0.05)? Why or why not?

Given the following information for trait X: breeding value variance = 25; mean = 500; repeatability = 0.6, and heritability = 0.25. In this population, 10% of the males and 90% of the females are kept. Calculate the response to selection (genetic change) per year for the following program. Females are selected based on their own record (one record) and males are selected based on performance of 10 half-sib progeny.         Lf = 3, Lm = 5

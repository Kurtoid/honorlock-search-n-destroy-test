Please read the following excerpts from the New York Times and then use what you have learned from class to answer questions 23-25: For Helping Immigrants, Chobani's Founder Draws ThreatsBy DAVID GELLES   OCT. 31, 2016   New York TimesBy many measures, Chobani embodies the classic American immigrant success story.Its founder, Hamdi Ulukaya, is a Turkish immigrant of Kurdish descent. He bought a defunct yogurt factory in upstate New York, added a facility in Twin Falls, Idaho, and now employs about 2,000 people making Greek yogurt.But in this contentious election season, the extreme right has a problem with Chobani: In its view, too many of those employees are refugees.As Mr. Ulukaya has stepped up his advocacy -- employing more than 300 refugees in his factories, starting a foundation to help migrants, and traveling to the Greek island of Lesbos to witness the crisis firsthand -- he and his company have been targeted with racist attacks on social media and conspiratorial articles on websites including Breitbart News....Mr. Ulukaya arrived in upstate New York in the 1990s to attend school. By 2002, he was making and selling feta cheese inspired by a family recipe. A few years later, he learned that a local yogurt and cheese factory that had closed was for sale. He received a loan of $800,000 from the Small Business Administration to purchase the factory, and started selling Chobani yogurt in 2007.As the business grew, Mr. Ulukaya needed more help. When he learned there was a refugee resettlement center in a nearby town, he asked if any of the newcomers wanted jobs at Chobani. Mr. Ulukaya provided transportation for the new hires, and he brought in translators to assist them. He paid the refugee workers salaries above the minimum wage, as he did other workers at the factory.When Chobani opened its factory in Twin Falls, Mr. Ulukaya once again turned to a local resettlement center. The company now employs resettled refugees from Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey, among other countries."The minute a refugee has a job, that's the minute they stop being a refugee," Mr. Ulukaya said in a talk he gave this year....Chobani and the other companies working with refugees are not exploiting them, said Jennifer Patterson, project director for the Partnership for Refugees, a federal program."It's the exact opposite," Ms. Patterson said. "These companies are looking to provide resettled refuges with the ability to live happy and productive lives."Chobani's work with refugees went largely unnoticed until this January, when Mr. Ulukaya spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. His message -- that corporations needed to do more to assist refugees -- broke through the high-minded rhetoric."He was quite a sensation there," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who attended the event. "Here was someone who went beyond the well-meaning chatter of Davos and was walking the walk."Cisco, IBM, Salesforce and more joined others in pledging assistance to refugees. Those companies and others began working with the Tent Foundation, which Mr. Ulukaya founded last year. Chobani has pledged to help other companies learn how to effectively integrate refugees into a work force.But while an alliance of well-known companies was now working together on the issue, the online critics zeroed in on Chobani. Shortly after Mr. Ulukaya spoke in Davos, the far-right website WND published a story originally titled "American Yogurt Tycoon Vows to Choke U.S. With Muslims."...Mr. Roth of Human Rights Watch attributed some of the xenophobia directed at Chobani to the election season."Some people are feeling left behind, and some people are concerned about terrorists," he said. "But Trump has given a voice to these sentiments."Mr. Barigar, a Democrat, concurred. "Donald Trump really fueled a sentiment about immigration that is shared by a very small part of our community," he said. "We are an agricultural center. We've depended on immigrants for a half-century or more."Mr. Ulukaya appears undeterred. In September, he participated in a round-table discussion with President Obama and business leaders on how corporations could do more to help refugees....

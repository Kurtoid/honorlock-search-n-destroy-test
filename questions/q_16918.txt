Scenario 2 (continued): A species of tropical fish inhabits coral reefs.  Researchers wants to understand the selective pressure on body size for these fish.  They mark 300 fish of sizes ranging from 1 to 12 inches.  They released these fish into an enclosure with their main predator, their main food source, and plenty of hiding spots.  Two years later the researchers returned and measured the surviving fish.    Researchers suspect that it is not just body size that matters for survival, but also coloration (how brightly colored the fish is). They measure coloration and body size on another 300 fish and come back in another two years to document survival.  They find this adaptive landscape:     Given this adaptive landscape, how would you predict the population will change over time (assuming body size and coloration are heritable)?

**Note: you will use this same artificial cell scenario for the next four questions. Imagine an artificial cell that is composed of a selectively permeable membrane.  The interior of the cell contains an aqueous solution (meaning water is the solvent) consisting of 4M galactose, 1M carbonate, and 0.00001M hydrogen ions.   This 'artificial cell' is immersed in a beaker containing a different solution. The solution in the beaker consists of 2 M galactose + 0.001M hydrogen ions (and again, water is the solvent).  The membrane is permeable to water and to small molecules such as galactose and hydrogen ions, but it is not permeable to larger ions such as carbonate.

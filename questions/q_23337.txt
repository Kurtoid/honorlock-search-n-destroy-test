Consider the following table that represents part of the memory of a 16-bit address space that has an addressability of 2 bytes (like LC-3):    ADDRESS CONTENTS   ... ...   0x0C10 0101 0010 0111 1011   0x0C0F 0000 1000 1100 1101   0x0C0E 0001 1011 0000 0011   0x0C0D 0110 1010 0001 1111   0x0C0C 0011 0100 0101 0011   0x0C0B 0000 1100 0000 1111   ... ...    The table above shows the addresses in hex (base 16) and the contents at the corresponding address in binary (base 2). A.) Interpret the contents at address 0x0C0C as two ASCII characters. [ascii] B.) Interpret the contents at the same address as A.) above as an unsigned integer. [unsigned] C.) Interpret the contents at address 0x0C0E as an LC-3 instruction to determine the operation.(Enter either ADD, JMP, LDR, or OTHER if it is not one of the first 3) [instr1] Recall that a "pointer" is a memory location that stores an address. We call it a pointer since the address it stores "points" to another memory location. D.) Interpret the contents at address 0x0C0B as a pointer.(Enter hex like the following example: 0x2A3F) [ptrvalue] E.) What are the contents of the memory location that the pointer above is pointing to?(Enter hex like the following example: 0x2A3F) [ptevalue]   REFERENCE: Partial Table of Hex to ASCII Characters:  20 sp 30 0 40 @ 50 P 60 ` 70 p 21 ! 31 1 41 A 51 Q 61 a 71 q 22 " 32 2 42 B 52 R 62 b 72 r 23 # 33 3 43 C 53 S 63 c 73 s 24 $ 34 4 44 D 54 T 64 d 74 t Table of LC-3 Opcodes in Hex:  ADD 0x1 JMP 0xC LDR 0x6

Determine the limiting reactant (LR) and the mass (in g) of nitrogen that can be formed from 55.0 g N2O4 and 50.0 g N2H4.  Some possibly useful molar masses are as follows:  N2O4 = 92.02 g/mol, N2H4 = 32.05 g/mol.             N2O4(l) + 2 N2H4(l)  -  3 N2(g) + 4 H2O(g)
BMED 2110 - Spring 2021 -  Quiz 6 - Section A01 This quiz is closed book/closed notes. In addition to the calculator provided within Honorlock you may use a scientific or graphing calculator.  As a biomedical engineer you are part of a study investigating the growth of plants in air containing high amounts of CO2. For this purpose you need to prepare a container with air at a given CO2 content.  You use the following procedure:   You add exactly 12.3 g of dry ice (frozen, solid CO2, density: 1.7 g/cm3) into an open steel container with a volume of 2.0 gallons; the container contains (CO2-free) air. The initial temperature within the container is 25.0 C. The atmospheric pressure in the laboratory is 1.00 atm.   The steel container is immediately sealed and the solid CO2 is vaporized to CO2    (CO2free) air is pumped into the container. The capacity of the pump at 25C is 500 ml/min.   The temperature in the container is equilibrated to 25 C and the pressure in the container is measured.  The final CO2 content in the container should be 10.%.     Questions:  Provide an outline of your solution strategy for B. and C. What is the final gauge pressure in the container in psi ?  How long does the pump have to run?     Pls carefully document your solution and briefly explain all steps.

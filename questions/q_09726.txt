Endocrine and Sex Hormone Hybrids: In order to release the thyroid hormones first the [26](26: gland) must release [27](27: hormone) which causes the[28](28: gland) to release [29](29: hormone) which stimulates the thyroid to release T3and T4.   In order to release cortisol first the [30](30: gland) must release a hormone which causes the [32](32: gland) to release [33](33: hormone) which stimulates the adrenal gland to release cortisol.   In the menstrual cycle ovulation occurs on day [34] (34: put the number in), in this phase [35](35: hormone) levels being released from the follicle get so high that they cause [36](36: Y or Z) feedback to the anterior pituitary gland for the release of [37](37: hormone), this hormone leads to rupture of the follicle and release of the egg.

Tank A contains 50 gallons of water in which 2 pounds of salt has been dissolved. Tank B contains 30 gallons of water in which 3 pounds of salt has been dissolved. A brine mixture with a concentration of 0.8 pounds of salt per gallon of water is pumped into tank A at the rate of 3 gallons per minute. The well-mixed solution is then pumped from tank A to tank B at the rate of 4 gallons per minute. The solution from tank B is also pumped through another pipe into tank A at the rate of 1 gallon per minute, and the solution from tank B is also pumped out of the system at the rate of 3 gallons per minute.  Find the correct differential equations with initial conditions for the amounts, x(t) and y(t), of salt in tanks A and B, respectively, at time t.

Supler Company produces a part used in the manufacture of one of its products. The unit product cost is $18, computed as follows:     direct materials   8     direct labor   4     variable manufacturing overhead   1     fixed manufacturing overhead   5     unit product cost   18     An outsie supplier has offered to provide the annual requirement of 4,000 of the parts for only $14 each. It is estimated that 60 percent of the fixed overhead cost above could be eliminated if the parts are purchased from the outside supplier. Based on these data, the per-unit dollar advantage or disadvantage of purchasing from the outside supplier would be:

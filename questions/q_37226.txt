In Exercise 4, you learned about a reaction that amylase catalyzes. Below, is an example of another enzyme-catalyzed reaction.    Lactase, is an enzyme found in the human body, which is responsible for breaking down lactose molecules. Lactose molecules are found in milk products. Many people are deficient in lactase, which makes them unable to effectively break down milk products. There is a specialized test that can be done to test for lactose deficiency, using blood glucose levels as the indicator. A scientist set up an experiment to test the effect of time on lactose breakdown through this enzyme-catalyzed reaction. In this experiment, the subjects consumed 1 cup of milk, and had their blood drawn every 15 minutes to test their blood glucose level. Give an example of a variable that must be held constant in this experiment.

Consumer Products International (IPI) is a health foods company which recently discovered that increased soy isoflavones (at least 500 mg every 2 days) in a person's diet has been able to extend a person's life span by at least 20 years.  The company developed a new product called "Soy for Life" which is a tasty breakfast bar that contains 500 mg of soy isoflavones in each bar.  Cost of research and development for the product was $3,000,000.  The breakfast bar market size is currently measured at 100 million units of which CPI serves 60%. Initial taste tests concluded that consumers are unable to make any taste distinctions between a regular breakfast bar and one that contains 500 mg of isoflavones. CPI plans to launch this new breakfast bar initially across the United States using its current distribution channel of supermarket chains and health food stores which have 5,000 locations combined.  The company then plans to expand the product market area to include South America, Europe and Asia and also intends to setup manufacturing plants in these expanded market areas.  Consumer Product International's fixed cost is currently at $1,200,000 per year with the total cost to produce each breakfast bar at $1.45.  The finding of several research studies has determined that consumers would be willing to pay $10.25 for "Soy for Life" breakfast at which the retail selling price would be targeted.  The retailer's margin is 40%, the wholesaler's margin is 15%. (Round partial units upward.  Round percentages to one decimal point.  Round currency to dollars and cents.) (a) What is the company's selling price of one "Soy for Life" breakfast bar to its wholesalers? (Note: the selling price is NOT $10.25)(b) What is the product's contribution margin as a percentage?  (c) What is the product's contribution per unit in dollars?  (Please state your answers clearly).

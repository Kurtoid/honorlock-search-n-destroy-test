(Q001) Eight states have legalized the recreational use of marijuana. In Texas, however, possession of less than two ounces of marijuana is a class B misdemeanor, and possession of two to four ounces is a class A misdemeanor. The maximum punishment for a class B is 180 days in the county jail and a $2,000 fine, and for a class A it is one year in jail and a $4,000 fine. Such punishments are unlikely--far more likely is a substantial fine and probation. However, until 2007 a person arrested with less than four ounces of marijuana would be taken to jail and booked and then likely spend hours in jail until he or she could post bond (and far longer in jail awaiting trial if unable to post bond). To ease jail crowding and to free police officers to deal with more egregious offenses, in 2007 the Texas legislature gave police the option to cite and then release a person arrested for possession of less than four ounces of marijuana. The citation would be much like a traffic ticket. The person would have to appear in court and would be subject to criminal punishment but would not be arrested, booked, or put in jail until bail was paid. The theory behind this change was that jail space would not be taken up by minor offenders, police resources would be saved (police in Dallas make 100 to 120 arrests per month for small amounts of marijuana), and counties would save money (on average it costs taxpayers $120 to arrest and book someone in an urban Texas county, and it costs taxpayers about $53 a day to keep a prisoner in jail). Despite these benefits, most counties proved unwilling to use the cite and release option. By 2017, however, some counties such as Hays, Williamson, Travis, Harris, and Bexar counties were frequently using it.Counties such as Collin have rejected "cite and release." District attorney Greg Davis said his county did not adopt the policy because "it may . . . lead some people to believe that drug use is not more serious than double parking." Prosecutors also claimed they lacked a system for dealing with misdemeanor tickets. Another concern was that without a booking process where all ten fingerprints are taken, police would have difficulty establishing a person's identity, and it would be easier for an offender to avoid showing up for trial. In response, supporters of cite and release point out that the offender is still subject to criminal punishment. Additionally, they point to a study of Hays County, where 95 percent of those cited and released did show up for trial.Other police departments, such as in the city of Denton, are looking into beginning cite and release primarily as a way of keeping police on patrol rather than having them tied up with booking persons on minor drug charges. City police officers in Denton, Texas, for example, made 224 marijuana possession arrests in 2016 and 261 in 2015. Each arrest and booking in Denton takes police two to three hours when they could be patrolling and answering other calls. The city of Dallas is in the early stages of implementing a cite and release program. Why is there sudden interest in cite and release, which has been allowed since 2007?

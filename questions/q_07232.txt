A 44-year-old male staying in a homeless shelter is alert and complaining of shortness of breath. He has a two-week history of cough with hemoptysis, fever, chills, and night sweats. Physical examination reveals skin to be warm and moist and lung sounds decreased in the right upper lobe with rhonchi. HR = 100, BP = 142/100, RR = 20, SaO2 = 95%. You should assume this patient has a high likelihood of having:
The shown beam cross-section has f'c = 4,000 psi and fy = 60,000 psi. Based on the strain (et) value developed in the steel at the ultimate moment stage, is the cross-section acceptable per the ACI code (i.e. can this section be used safely)

Case Study #3: ST was admitted to the hospital 48 hours ago, at which time he was diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis based on his symptoms, lab values and diagnostic tests. Prior to this admission, he had no other medical conditions and his nutritional status was adequate. He is currently NPO.  The medical team has ordered a nutrition consult. Suppose it is now 6 days since the onset of ST's severe acute pancreatitis. He now has small intestinal ileus and ischemia. Which of the following actions would be most appropriate?

In the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), fragments of DNA are incubated with a protein of interest or protein extract containing many proteins and then analyzed on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide or agarose gel. The DNA used in the experiment is visualized either by staining with a dye or by covalently attaching a radioactive phosphate group at one end. Free DNA fragments migrate more quickly through the gel than DNA bound by protein.  Thus, a shift in migration of DNA from fast to slow in the presence of protein indicates a direct binding interaction between a protein(s) and DNA. You are interested in determining which of four proteins, A, B, C, and D, may compete with cAMP-CRP for binding to the lac operon CRP-binding site using EMSA.  You mix radiolabeled DNA fragments containing the CRP-binding site sequence with each of the four proteins and perform nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.  The results are shown in Figure 1.      Question I)   Which protein(s), A, B, C, and/or D, appear to bind to the CRP-binding site? [one] Question II) Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the band pattern seen in lane 6? [two]

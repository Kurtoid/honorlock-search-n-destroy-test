A study by Farnsworth was conducted to determine the effect of a latex "teat sealer" on the effect of mammary gland infections in dairy cattle. Basically, the 2 teats (2 quarters) on the right side of the udder of each cow were "dipped" (immersed) in a latex material after milking, and the 2 teats on the left side were not dipped in the latex sealer and served as the "control". The sealer was easily removed at the next milking prior to milker unit attachment, and following milking the same teats received the same treatment (teat sealer or not). Cows were treated like this at each milking and followed for 1 year.  Milk samples for culture were obtained from all quarters at monthly intervals to detect new Staphylococcal intra-mammary infection (nIMI). The following table was created from the report      # with new Staphylococcus IMI (nIMI +)  # without new Staphylococcus IMI (nIMI-) Row total    Latex Dip + 51 1007 1058   Latex Dip - 74 984 1058   Column total 125 1991 2116     The relative risk of IMI in dipped vs not dipped quarters is:

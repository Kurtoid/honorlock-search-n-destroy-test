Short answer questions, answer on blank paper.  (6 points) Draw the amino acids Asn and His and show the most prevalent interaction that would occur between the R-groups at pH 5. To show the interaction, use a dotted line between the atoms that are interacting and label the interaction. You can draw the two amino acids as separate molecules or as part of a peptide. Whatever you do, you must have the proper charges on all functional groups. Label the interaction!    2. (5 points) Draw the dipeptide Glu-Cys as it would occur at pH 9. Make sure to show proper orientation of R-groups.    Immediately before exiting Honorlock, you must show your short answer section to your camera. We need to be able to clearly see your work so hold it about 18 inches away from your camera and slowly move your paper to capture the entire page. If you have multiple pages, make sure to show all pages.

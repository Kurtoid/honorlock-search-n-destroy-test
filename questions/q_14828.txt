A sample of salt was to be analyzed for chloride content using Fajan's method. For this method, chloride in a sample is titrated with a standard silver solution to form a silver chloride precipitate:   A 1.1034 g sample of the salt was weighed into an Erlenmeyer flask and 50 mL of water, 0.1 g of dextrin, and 5 drops of dichlorofluorescein indicator was added to the flask. It took 39.44 mL of 0.5042 M AgNO3 to reach the endpoint of the titration.   Calculate the mass of chloride in the sample. [R1] g   Report your answer with 3 decimal places.

A survey crew has set offset stakes for construction of the 8" sewer shown in the design plan below. When the existing 12"sewer line is uncovered for the construction of Maintenance Hole (MH) 1, it is found that the actual flow line elevation is 1,228.69' rather than the design elevation of 1,228.47'. The gradient must be revised, holding the flow line elevation of 1,229.27' at MH 2. If the elevation of the grade stake is 1,235.06, the cut (feet) to the flow line that you would mark on the stake at Station 1+25 is most nearly:

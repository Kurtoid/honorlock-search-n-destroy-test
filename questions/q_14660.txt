Case Study 1 Juanita, a 33-year-old who identifies as a woman, is seeking therapy from you for treatment of depressed mood, chronic suicidal thoughts, social isolation, and poor personal hygiene. She spent the past 6 months isolated in her apartment, lying bed, eating junk food, watching television, and doing more online shopping than she can afford. Multiple past treatments yielded little effect. Juanita is currently single and unemployed. She is the middle of three children in an upper-middle-class immigrant family in which the father reportedly values professional achievement over all else. She felt isolated throughout her school years and experienced recurrent periods of depressed mood. Within her family, she reports being known for angry outbursts. She did well academically in high school but dropped out of college because of frustrations with a roommate and a professor. She attempted a series of internships and entry-level jobs with the expectation that she would return to college, but she kept quitting because "bosses are idiots. They come across as great and they all turn out to be twisted." These "traumas" always left her feeling terrible about herself ("I can't even succeed as a clerk?") and angry at her bosses ("I could run the place and probably will"). She reports dating when she was younger but that she never let anyone get close physically because she became too anxious when any intimacy began to develop. Juanita's history includes cutting herself superficially on a number of occasions, along with persistent thoughts that she would be better off dead. She said that she was generally "down and depressed" but that she had had dozens of 1- to 2-day "manias" in which she was energized and edgy and pulled all-nighters. She tends to "crash" the next day and sleep for 12 hours. She has been in psychiatric treatment since age 17 and had been psychiatrically hospitalized three times after overdoses. Treatments had consisted primarily of medication: mood stabilizers, low dose neuroleptics, and antidepressants that had been prescribed in various combinations in the context of supportive psychotherapy. During your mental status examination, she was casually groomed and somewhat unkempt. She was cooperative, coherent, and goal directed. She was generally dysphoric with a constricted affect but did smile appropriately several times. She described shame at her poor performance but also believed she was "on Earth to do something great." She described her father as a spectacular success, but he was also a "power hungry control freak who was always trying to manipulate people." She described quitting jobs because people were disrespectful. For example, she said that when she worked as a clerk at a department store, people would often be rude or unappreciative ("and I was there only in preparation to become a buyer; it was ridiculous"). Toward the end of your first session, she became angry with you after you quickly glanced at the clock ("Are you bored already?").

Case Study #2a Scenario Madison is a 14-year-old girl who spends her summers at the community pool with her friends. Bugs are always a problem there, and wearing bug spray to prevent bites is not a real priority. After an evening pool party, many people complained about the mosquitoes and most went home with itchy bites. Maddie was a scratcher and a picker, and she opened the skin around several of her bites.    Signs and Symptoms A week or so after the party, Maddie woke her mom up and said she didn't feel well, that her body hurt and she felt feverish. Her mom gave her aspirin and helped her take a warm bath before sending her back to bed.  The next morning, Maddie had a high fever and alternated between acting alert and acting disoriented. Alarmed, her mom took her to the hospital. At the time she was seen in the ER, Maddie's temperature was 103degF and she appeared disoriented. Her heart rate and respiratory rate were both elevated. Several blood tests were ordered, along with a blood culture, which was sent to the microbiology lab and plated on several types of selective and differential media, including mannitol salt agar and blood agar. Shortly after being admitted to the hospital, Maddie went into respiratory distress and had to be intubated. Rocephin, a cephalosporin antibiotic, was started as an IV.   Testing Colonies of salt-tolerant, mannitol-fermenting bacteria grew from Maddie's blood on the mannitol salt agar (MSA) plate.       Question What is the bacteriological interpretation of the blood agar plate (BAP) results shown above?

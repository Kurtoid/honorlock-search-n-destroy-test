Concerned about the amount of pollution in local creeks and ponds, 24 randomly selected water samples were taken and the pH level of each is measured. The data from the 24 water samples had a mean pH level of 6.7 and a standard deviation of 0.24.  The data also follows a Normal distribution.  Create a 99% confidence level for the average pH level in local creeks and ponds.  Round the CI to 2 places behind the decimal.  Show all work and answer on your paper.  Write your confidence interval in the box below.

The following experiment is used for the following question.A researcher discovered a species of moth that lays its eggs on oak trees. Eggs are laid at two distinct times of the year: early in spring when the oak trees are flowering and in midsummer when flowering is past. Caterpillars from eggs that hatch in spring feed on oak flowers and look like oak flowers, but caterpillars that hatch in summer feed on oak leaves and look like oak twigs.How does the same population of moths produce such different-looking caterpillars on the same trees? To answer this question, the biologist caught many female moths from the same population and collected their eggs. He put at least one egg from each female into eight identical cups. The eggs hatched, and at least two larvae from each female were maintained in one of the four temperature and light conditions listed below.    Temperature Day Length   Springlike Springlike   Springlike Summerlike   Summerlike springlike   Summerlike summerlike    In each of the four environments, one of the caterpillars was fed oak flowers, the other oak leaves. Thus, there were a total of eight treatment groups (4 environments x 2 diets).Recall that eggs from the same female were exposed to each of the eight treatments used. This aspect of the experimental design tested which of the following hypotheses?

It has an energy gap EG = [e] eV, effective masses mn* = [mn] m0 and mp* = [mp] m0, where m0 is the free electron mass = 9.11 x 10-31 kg. For 5 points calculate the position of the intrinsic Fermi level. For another 5 points find the electron and hole concentrations n0 and p0 when EC - EF = [ecf] eV.

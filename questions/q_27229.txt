Bard Manufacturing uses a job order cost accounting system. During one month Bard purchased $198,000 of raw materials on credit; issued materials to production of $195,000 of which $30,000 were indirect. Bard incurred a factory payroll of $150,000, paid in cash, of which $40,000 is classified as indirect labor. Bard uses a predetermined overhead application rate of 150% of direct labor cost. What is the total manufacturing costs added during the period?
A process characteristic follows a normal distribution with a mean of 25.15 and standard deviation of 0.9.  The spec limits for the characteristic are 25.00 +/- 1.5.   If a sample of 6 parts are taken from the process, what is the probability that there will be no parts out of spec in the sample?

A distribution of point charges is placed on the coordinate system shown below. The axis is marked in meters. Assume the potential infinitely far from the origin is zero.   a) Calculate the electric potential due to the distribution of charges at point P, which is located at the origin. b) Find the electric potential at r= 8mi+4mj (8m, 4m) labeled as P' in the figure. c) A charge qc = 1.965x10-3 C is placed at the origin and is moved infinitely far away. What is the change in potential energy for qc. d) First of all, qc is removed from the origin. Then a charge of qd=8.65x10-7 C is placed at P'. What is the change in potential energy in moving this charge to the origin? part a) V1 =-3.182 x107 V V2 =1.659x107 V V3 =5.529 x106 V VP =-9.699x106 V part b) V1' =-3 x107 V V2' =3.996x107 V V3' =2.492 x106 V VP' =1.245 x107V part c) 12. The charge qc = 1.965x10-3 C is originally placed at the origin and then moved infinitely far from the origin. What is the changed in electric potential energy for this situation? Put your answer in scientific notation, and write the coefficient rounding to 3 decimal places (no units).

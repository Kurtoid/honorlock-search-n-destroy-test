I made a little Book in which I allotted a Page for each of the Virtues.  I rul'd each Page with red Ink so as to have seven Columns, one for each Day of the Week, marking each Column with a Letter for the Day. I cross'd these Columns with thirteen red Lines, marking the Beginning of each Line with the first Letter of one of the Virtues, on which Line and in its proper Column I might mark by a little black spot every Fault I found upon Examination, to have been committed responding that Virtue upon that day. I determined to give a Week's strict attention to each of the Virtues successively. Thus in the first Week my great Guard was to avoid every the least Offence against Temperance, leaving the other Virtues to their ordinary Chance, only marking every Evening the Fault of the Day.      Who is this author?

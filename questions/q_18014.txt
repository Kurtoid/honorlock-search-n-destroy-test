Use the following information to answer the question.Giardia intestinalis can cause disease in several different mammalian species, including humans. Giardia organisms (G. intestinalis) that infect humans are similar morphologically to those that infect other mammals, thus they have been considered a single species. However, G. intestinalis has been divided into different subgroups based on their host and a few other characteristics.In 1999, a DNA sequence comparison study tested the hypothesis that these subgroups actually constitute different species. The following phylogenetic tree was constructed from the sequence comparison of rRNA from several subgroups of G. intestinalis and a few other morphologically distinct species of Giardia. The researchers concluded that the subgroups of Giardia are sufficiently different from one another genetically that they could be considered different species. (T. Monis, et al. 1999. Molecular systematics of the parasitic protozoan Giardia intestinalis. Mol. Biol. Evol. 16[9]:1135-44.)By examining the phylogenetic tree diagrammed in the figure above, what conclusion can you draw about the species G. microti?

How many types of supporting (glial) cells are found in the nervous system?
Build a full tree diagram. You want ice cream.  First, you have to decide between vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry.  There is a 40% chance you pick vanilla and 20% chance you pick chocolate.  Next comes the topping, sprinkles or fruit.  If you choose vanilla, there is a 60% chance that you pick fruit.  If you choose strawberry, there is a 70% chance of you getting sprinkles.  Lastly, if you choose chocolate, there is a 70% chance that you go with fruit. The tree diagram is worth 6 points.  The questions below are worth 2 points a piece. P(vanilla and fruit)= [1] P(sprinkles or chocolate)= [2] P(sherbert)= [3]

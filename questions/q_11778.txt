A retailer plant to sell two different styles of a particular seasonal item. Because of the lead times involved, the retailer must order the items well before the selling season and cannot cancel, modify, or reorder during the selling season. Demand for each style during the season is Normally distributed with a mean of 2000 and a standard deviation of 800. The retailer pays $100 per unit and plans to sell them at the retail price of $175 per unit. Any units not sold during the season can be sold on the secondary market for $70 per unit.  The styles are delivered by ocean container at a cost of $4,000 per container and the retailer is responsible for this transportation cost.  a. Ignoring the transportation costs, how many units of each style 1 and how many units of style 2 should the retailer order to maximize expected profits?

A chemist heats a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen gases in a sealed container at a constant temperature until the mixture reaches a dynamic equilibrium containing N2(g), O2(g) and NO(g). N2(g) + O2(g) 2NO(g) The chemist repeats the experiment at the same temperature using the same initial amounts of N2(g) and O2(g), but at a much higher pressure. Which statements about the second experiment at higher pressure are correct?

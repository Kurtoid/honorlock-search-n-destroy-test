A 208 V (l-l), 3 phase, six pole, 60 Hz induction motor has the following parameters at 60 Hz:  R1 = 0 O,          R2 = 0.0935 O,                   X1+X2 = 0.29 O,            Xm = [?].  The motor slip at rated load is 0.02.   Suppose the motor is driving a constant load torque equal to 50% of the rated value, and motor operates at rated voltage at 60 Hz. Constant V/Hz should be maintained  only as appropriate.  Find the peak torque and slip at peak torque for operation at 90 Hz. Find the peak torque and slip at peak torque for operation at 35 Hz. If the voltage is reduced to 65% of the rated value and with a stator frequency of 60 Hz, find the rotor speed, wr.

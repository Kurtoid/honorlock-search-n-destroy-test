In rabbits, there is a gene that controls ear length, with a dominant allele "T" for long ears and a recessive allele "t" for short ears. At another gene locus, there are alleles "B" for black coat and "W" for white coat. Neither the B or W allele is dominant, and BW produces a gray coat. These two allele pairs assort independently. If a gray rabbit that is heterozygous at the gene locus controlling ear length is mated with a white rabbit that is also heterozygous at the gene locus controlling ear length, what is the probability that their first offspring will be gray with long ears?

Assume the following  TCP Parameters: nextSeqNum = 1000nextExpSeqNum = 999WindowSize  => can accommodate the request by the application layer.Maximum payload size / segment (MSS) = 500 bytes.  (Note: This value is made-up to make it easier for you to perform calculation.)Select all the segments that need to be sent to satisfy the above requirements.   If more than one segments need to be sent, the segments will be sent back to back.

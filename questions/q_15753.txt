A local outdoor pig farm that provides pigs to a regional barbeque restaurant chain has had several sows that have aborted their litters in late gestation recently, followed by litters with stillborn pigs, weak pigs at birth and as a consequence, liveborn litter size has been reduced. This is upsetting to the owner as well as financially devastating since he relies on the specialty market to receive a premium price for his pigs. On the farm visit to investigate the problem, you notice that the pigs have ready access to a creek and to pond water, as well as other pools of standing water and mud holes.    In addition to instituting an appropriate vaccination program, you advise the farmer to:

Consider the following C loop.  The loop in its present form cannot be parallelized.  Cut and paste the code below and transform the loop at the C source level so it is in a form that can be parallelized. double a[1000], b[1000], c[1000], d[1000], t;...t = 0.0;for (i = 1; i < 1000; i++) {   a[i] = a[i] + b[i-1];   t = t + c[i]*d[i];   b[i] = d[i]*2.0;}

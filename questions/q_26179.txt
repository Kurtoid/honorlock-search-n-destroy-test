Assume that a class called ACunit has been declared with a private attribute called status (a boolean) that stores whether the ACunit is off (false) or on (true). The class also has a private attribute called serviceHours (an integer). The class has getters and setters for both attributes and a default constructor that initializes both attributes. Furthermore, the class has the following method: public void decreaseHours(int amount) {    serviceHours = serviceHours - amount;}   Assume that the main method of the driver contains the code that declares and creates an ACunit variable called roomAC. Write code for the main method that checks whether the roomAC is on or off. If it is on, then your code should turn it off, and decrease its serviceHours by 3.

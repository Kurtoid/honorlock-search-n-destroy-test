In a park there is a population of 500 peppered moths that are either black or mottled grey (peppered).  In these species of moth, black color is dominant to peppered color.   Of this population, approximately 200 individuals are peppered.  Assuming that the population is at equilibrium for this gene/locus, answer the following.  Part A: Calculate the allele frequencies and genotype frequencies (p,2pq, etc.).  Perform all calculations to three decimal places.   (Note: you will NOT be scored on part A, but your work in part A, will be required to do Part B.)   Part B: BONUS: After the previous predictions were made, actual samples were obtained from all individuals in the population described above.  Genetic analyses were done, and it was found that of those that were black, 80 are homozygous dominant and 220 are heterozygous.   Is the population above at equilibrium? Use the chi-square test to determine this.   (The chi-square formula and chart is shown below the questions for convenience.) Answer the following:  1. What was the chi-square value? 2. What was the df (degree of freedom) that you used? 3. Did you accept or reject the hypothesis? Why? 4. Is the population at equilibrium? Why or why not?

"The New Colossus" by Emma Lazarus  Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. "Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

A group of ten second-graders were playing on the playground after school. Debbie, who was seven years old, was an avid Pokemon fan. She suggested to the group that they play a new game called "Pokemon-tag." She explained the rules of the game: one person would be the Pokemon-catcher and the other players would be the Pokemon. To catch a Pokemon, the catcher has to tag the Pokemon on the shoulder or back. Once the Pokemon has been tagged, he/she is out of the game. The object of the game is to catch (tag) all of the Pokemon. If, however, a Pokemon manages to tag the catcher from behind, the game is over, and a new player is selected as the catcher. Eager to play, each of the ten second-graders agreed to play Pokemon tag. Since Debbie suggested the game, the group decided that she could catch first. Once the game began, the remaining nine children dispersed in order to avoid being tagged by Debbie. Debbie immediately ran toward her arch-nemesis, Paul, who was nine years old. Paul often teased and taunted Debbie for her red hair and glasses. As Debbie ran toward Paul, he began taunting her even further by saying, "I bet you can't catch me, four-eyes! You're such a dweeb! When I get the chance I'm going to tag you so hard you fall on your ugly face!" Debbie knew that Paul would follow through and became frightened.   Derek, Paul's good friend, thinking he might be able to sneak up behind Debbie as she was still trying to tag Paul, approached Debbie from behind. As Derek approached Debbie, he grabbed a rock from the ground and hurled it at Debbie, believing that he could at least tag her out without having to get close enough for her to tag him first. However, just as he threw the rock, Debbie zig-zagged, thereby avoiding being hit. Instead, the rock hit Paul square in the face, causing him injury. After seeing Paul get hit, Debbie quickly realized that the rock was intended for her and she ran inside, fearing both Derek and Paul.   Discuss the pertinent legal issues.

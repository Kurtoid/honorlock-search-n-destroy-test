Tangerine Corp. constructed a machine at a total cost of $338 million. Construction was completed at the end of 2017 and the machine was placed in service at the beginning of 2018. The machine was being depreciated over a 10-year life using the sum-of-the-years'-digits method. By that method, accumulated depreciation at the end of 2020 is $162.0 million. The residual value is expected to be $8.0 million. At the beginning of 2021, Tangerine decided to change to the straight-line method. Ignoring income taxes, what will be Tangerine's depreciation expense for 2021

Sparks Snowcones Shop sells three sizes of snow cones: medium, large, and jumbo.  The medium snow cone requires 1 cup of ice and 1 shot of syrup.  The large snow cone requires 3 cups of ice and 2 shots of syrup.  The jumbo snow cone requires 6 cups of ice and 3 shots of syrup.  During rush hour, the shop uses an average of a total of 27 cups of ice and 18 shots of syrup.   If x = # of medium snow cones, y = # of large snow cones, and z = # of jumbo snow cones, what system of equations do you need to set up to determine how many of each type of snow cones the shop sells during rush hour?
Select the name that matches the structure below. (Select any/all that apply)
Find the critical values for a right tail test, with alpha=0.10 and n = 7
use the formula n = p + h - f, where n is the desired nozzle pressure in psi, p is the engine (pump) pressure in psi, h is the head gain or loss in psi, and f is the friction loss in psi.  For h, use a positive value of 0.5psi/foot if the head is adding pressure to the hose (nozzle downhill from pump) or a negative 0.5psi/foot if the head is subtracting pressure from the hose (nozzle uphill from pump). For f, use 5psi for the friction loss generated by each fitting in the line. A progressive, 6 length hose lay has five fittings connecting the hoses together.  The nozzle outlet is [h] feet below the engine.  If the desired nozzle pressure is [n], at what pressure does the engine need to perform?

Vandiver, ACS A 75 y/o Caucasian female patient of yours is complaining at the pharmacy counter about taking too many medications. Since having a MI 5 years ago, she has lost weight, stopped smoking, and is doing her best to follow the DASH diet. She would like to stop all of her medications, but knows that she should talk to her doctor first.  BP at pharmacy today: 125/74 mmHg, HR 50 bpm PMH: MI w/ drug-eluting stent x 2 (5 years ago); type 2 diabetes with macroalbuminuria, gout Current medications:ASA 81 mg dailyMetoprolol succinate 50 mg dailyLosartan 50 mg dailyGlipizide 5 mg BIDAllopurinol 300 mg daily Past medications:ClopidogrelMetforminBenazepril  You correctly tell her:
Colin flips a coin and Rose puts down one, two, or three fingers.  The game is zero-sum and goes like this:      Colin      Heads Tails   Rose 1 (5,-5) (-5,5)    2 (1,-1) (-1,1)    3 (-4,4) (-1,1)    Since Colin is not deciding, consider this a game against nature with Colin being nature.  Find which row would be preferred by LaPlace (the row with the highest row sum), Wald (the row with the highest minimum row entry), or Savage ( the row with the smallest maximum regret where the regret is the difference between an entry and the largest entry in the column.)  Label which is which.

Question 3 (50 pts) A circuit is shown below.  Circuit parameters are as follow: threshold voltage Vth = 1V, kn' = mnCox = 100mA/V2, l=0 (no channel length modulation), VDD = 5V, VSS = -5V, RG = 10MO, RS=1.5kO, RL=20kO.  The 1mA DC current source is ideal. Assume the MOSFET transistor is in the saturation mode. The signal source vi has zero resistance. 1. Perform DC analysis and find the gate voltage VG, source voltage VS, and the required aspect ratio . 2. Draw the small signal model of the complete circuit. 3. Calculate the voltage gain  , the input resistance Rin, and the output resistance Rout as noted in the figure.

In medical oncology, PET (positron emission tomography) is used to selectively image tumors in the body and to monitor cancer progression and response to treatment. Before performing a PET scan, the patient should fast for at least several hours for blood glucose to be sufficiently low. At the time of the scan, the positron-emitting glucose analog fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is injected into the bloodstream and the patient is asked to wait for up to an hour while avoiding physical activity. Finally, the scanner moves slowly over the body to reveal the location of possible tumors. Why do you think the patient should avoid physical activity before the scan?

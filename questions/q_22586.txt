Distributed Encoding Our goal here is to first decode from VEX (distributed encoding format) The functional unit arrangement that is used by VLIW decoder is:  add  stw ldw mul div mov Generate the decoded form for the VEX instructions in which the syllables are assigned to the appropriate function units and the other slots are filled with nops. For example consider the VEX instruction c0    add $r0.10 = $r0.12, 0x1b c0    ldw $r0.12 = 0x28[$r0.4];; Should be transformed to c0 add nop c0 ldw nop nop nop **Please note, include c0 in front of each instruction which is not a nop as shown above, also you don't need to include the rest of the instruction only the functional unit types** Vex Instruction sequence to be used for solving the problem     c0    add $r0.59 = $r0.1, 0x1c     c0    stw 0x68[$r0.1] = $r0.2;;    c0    add $r0.2 = $r0.1, 0x30    c0    mov $r0.4 = $r0.0    c0    div $r0.6 = $r0.59, $r0.0    c0    ldw $r0.58 = 0x68[$r0.1];;    c0    mul $r0.5 = $r0.1 0x40    c0    add $r0.7 = $r0.6, $r0.2;;    c0    stw 0x10[$r0.1] = $r0.2    c0    mov $r0.9 = $r0.5;; Note that the above is a scheduled code on 4-wide VLIW shown in VEX format (which uses distributed encoding) where the stop bit is signified by the use of ";;" as in VEX and also the code uses a single cluster. Note that nops are not shown and each long instruction could have at most 4 parts.   Instruction 0: [distributedencoding0] Instruction 1: [distributedencoding1] Instruction 2: [distributedencoding2] Instruction 3: [distributedencoding3]   Masked Encoding Our next goal is to encode the decoded instructions in the Distributed Encoding section back into a masked encoding format. In Masked Encoding  the mask of bits equal to the number of functional units is used at the beginning of each VLIW instruction and the PC is calculated based on the template (bit mask). An example of Mask-based encoding is shown below.  The decoded format will have nops for the corresponding functional unit which is not used. Starting with the decoded instructions generated in Distributed Encoding above, generate the Masked Encoding along with the PCinc for the same. You can refer to the following to understand the details of how masked encoding works.  mask0 = [mask0], PCInc=[pcinc0] mask1 = [mask1], PCInc=[pcinc1] mask2 = [mask2], PCInc=[pcinc2] mask3 = [mask3], PCInc=[pcinc3]

SYNTHESIS: You are invited to write an article on Modern Fantasy Literature in a popular literary review. Using more particularly each of the last three books we have read (A Wizard of Earthsea, Harry Potter and American Gods-but you can also quote the others in supplement), what would you say are the characteristic elements of the genre and what makes a novel a Fantasy story? Talk about the different variances and recurrent elements. Write the article and quote elements taken from these three books (each one needs to be mentioned). Imagine your reader doesn't know much about the genre and think it is not very serious/important/valuable. Try to reach a conclusion of why you think the genre is so popular today? Do not assume the reader know much about it or write it like if you were writing to me. Be as much completed as possible to get full points.   (Length = the equivalent to 4 US Letter pages (or half a Blue/Green book) - That is about between 120-140 lines here on Canvas)

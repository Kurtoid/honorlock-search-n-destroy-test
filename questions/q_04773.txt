Wing Foot is a shoe franchise commonly found in shopping centers across the United States. Wing Foot knows that its stores will not show a profit unless they gross over $940,000 per year. Let A be the event that a new Wing Foot store grosses over $940,000 its first year. Let B be the event that a store grosses over $940,000 its second year. Wing Foot has an administrative policy of closing a new store if it does not show a profit in either of the first two years. Assume that the accounting office at Wing Foot provided the following information: 65% of all Wing Foot stores show a profit the first year; 70% of all Wing Foot store show a profit the second year (this includes stores that did not show a profit the first year); however, 83% of Wing Foot stores that showed a profit the first year also showed a profit the second year. Compute P(A or B) if P(A) = 0.65, P(B) = 0.70, and P(B|A) = 0.83. Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.

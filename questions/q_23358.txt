The velocity of a car traveling due east is uniformly reduced from 25.0 m/s to 15.3 m/s in a distance of 112 m. (a) What is the acceleration of the car? (b) How much time has elapsed during the acceleration? (c)  If one assumes that the car continues to decelerate at the same rate, how much time would elapse in bringing the car to rest from 25.0 m/s? (d) What total distance is required to bring the car to rest from 25.0 m/s?  Solve each part with only the original information and any information given in that question or the answer from a previous question. Do not use information from a later question - i.e., don't use the answer from part (b) to solve part (a).

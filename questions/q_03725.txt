Answer the following question based on the following scenarioDuring a kitchen inspection you observe the following. A dietary worker eating food off the line which hasn't started yet. The dietary aide states they are taste testing the food. You review the temperature logs, all the temps are acceptable, but there are none recorded for the pureed or ground foods. The staff states they took the temps but there is no place to put the results on the form. As you observe the line, you notice they are using appropriate sized scoops, but are putting heaping amounts on each plate of the macaroni and cheese. Per the written menu the regular diet should receive apple pie and the cardiac diet should receive cinnamon apple slices. You notice everyone is receiving the apple pie. As you walk through the rest of the kitchen, you notice the washed dishes being dried with a towel, and you feel one of the pans which is greasy on the outside. In the walk in refrigerator, there is no thermometer present, several lids are not securely on the containers, the zucchini is moldy, and there is an open undated bag of cheese. As you are finishing your inspection, the foodservice director informs you they have had a roach problem. She has the staff pull apart the tray line where a large outlet is located. When she kicks the outlet, several small roaches run out. She tells you, pest control has been out twice now and this is still an issue 39. Which of the following tags would most likely be issued upon inspection? a. F813 - inadequate appearance, attractive, tasty foodb. F925 - roach problemc. F550 - food temperatures not hot enoughd.

Order the steps involved in a possible semi supervised training iteration with cross-view/ augmentation assuming we do everything sequentially   Train the model on labelled set of examples Initialize a model with random weights.  Predict using the model on a weakly augmented unlabelled sample with class scores P1 Predict using the model on a strongly augmented unlabelled sample with class scores P2 Using P1 as the true distribution and P2 as the predicted distribution, use a KL divergence loss to train the model.  Using P2 as the true distribution and P1 as the predicted distribution, use a KL divergence loss to train the model.

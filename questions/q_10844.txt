The picture below is used for Problems 2 and 3. For problem 2 only concentrate on the part of the path before the spring.  A 2.50 kg box slides down an incline plane that is 5.00 m long as shown in the picture. If the box moves at constant speed of 3.25 m/s through the entire path down the ramp, what are all the forces acting on the box? What is the work done by EACH of these forces (you should have a value for the work done by each force)? DO NOT CONSIDER THE SPRING FOR THIS PROBLEM.

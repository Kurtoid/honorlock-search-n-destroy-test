he owner of a 120-sow outdoor herd that produces pigs for the show-pig market has experienced a clinical disease outbreak that she first noticed when gestating sows went off-feed and showed a mild cough about 4 weeks ago.  She noted 3-4 aborted litters of pigs in the woods shortly after that.  This is your first farm visit, since she normally gets her veterinary/health information from the internet and a nationally-renowned "show pig vet" that consults on the phone and fills prescriptions for her but rarely if ever visits the farm.  When you visit the site, you note that sows at the time of farrowing are producing high numbers of stillborn and weak pigs, with some increase in mummies.  Pigs that are born alive are weak and, subsequently, preweaning mortality has increased.  Some of the pigs in the farrowing huts are showing CNS signs. Nursery-age pigs on the site are showing some CNS signs and are coughing. The owner tells you that there are some feral pigs in the area.  In the course of the history-taking, she casually mentions the unexpected and acute death of her dog at about the same time the other clinical signs began.  The next step in management of this case is:

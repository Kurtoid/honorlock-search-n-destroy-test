Ubi cum praegressi equites non portas clausas, non stationem pro portis excubare, non armatos esse in muris rettulissent, aliud priori simile miraculum eos sustinuit; noctemque veriti et ignotae situm urbis, inter Romam atque Anienem consedere, exploratoribus missis circa moenia aliasque portas quaenam hostibus in perdita re consilia essent. Romani cum pars maior ex acie Veios petisset quam Romam, nemo superesse quemquam praeter eos qui Romam refugerant crederet, complorati omnes pariter vivi mortuique totam prope urbem lamentis impleverunt. Privatos deinde luctus stupefecit publicus pavor, postquam hostes adesse nuntiatum est; mox ululatus cantusque dissonos vagantibus circa moenia turmatim barbaris audiebant. Omne inde tempus suspensos ita tenuit animos usque ad lucem alteram ut identidem iam in urbem futurus videretur impetus.

Bacterial Counts in Food Look at the three plates that were made using the serial dilution plate technique to estimate CFU/ml from a sample of pasteurized milk on a grocery store shelf. After dilution, inoculation, and incubation, the following results were observed:  The 10-2 dilution has 986 CFU. The 10-3 dilution has 136 CFU. The 10-4 dilution has 24 CFU.  The acceptable CFU/ml of pasteurized milk is 10,000 to 20,000 CFU/ml (1x104 - 2x104 CFU/ml). Should this milk be pulled off the shelf? Justify your answer by calculating and reporting the CFU/ml of the sample used to make these dilution plates.

The neurotransmitter epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is involved in regulating visceral functions (e.g., respiration) and plays an important role in the fight-or-flight response in many animals. Consider the structure of N-protonated epinephrine (shown below) and answer the following questions.  The lowest-energy conformation of N-protonated epinephrine is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and the ammonium group. Which of the following Newman projections (A-F) represents this conformation viewed through the C1-C2 bond? [conformation]  Recall that dihedral angles are measured clockwise when answering the next two questions. Consider the conformation of N-protonated epinephrine in which the aryl (Ar) substituent and the ammonium group are eclipsed. What is the dihedral angle between hydroxyl group and ammonium group in this conformation? [dihedral1] What is the dihedral angle between the aryl (Ar) substituent and the ammonium group in Newman structure E? [dihedral2] Do Newman structures B and D represent conformational isomers? [isomers]

James knows that infants naturally pucker their lips when they are exposed to sour tastes. He buys his infant son a bright red pacifier. When he gives the pacifier to his son the first time, his son takes the pacifier and sucks on it without making any particular facial expression. Every subsequent time, right before he gives his son the pacifier, James dips the pacifier in lemon juice (which is very sour). James finds that after about 10 times doing this, his son starts to pucker his lips as soon as he touches the bright red pacifier (before he even puts it in his mouth). In this example of classical conditioning, the unconditioned stimulus is:
Which statement best describes the function of the extrinsic laryngeal muscles, infrahyoid group?

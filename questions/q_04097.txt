Over 38,000 discarded animal 2. bones/food have been found there - probably representing at least 1,000 animals. Analysis of these bones can tell us a great deal about where the food came from, and how people prepared their meals. Of the bones and teeth excavated at the site, 90% were from pigs, and the rest mostly from cattle. Many still had meat attached to them when they were discarded, suggesting that there was more than enough 3. food/land to go around. Some of the bones have cut marks made by flint tools, showing that beef was cut up into pieces. Burnt foot bones suggest that pigs were often roasted over open fires. This was not regular, everyday consumption. Many of the pigs had been killed at about nine months old. Since the piglets were most probably born in the spring, they were, therefore, all being slaughtered at midwinter. This suggests that people were gathering for 4. work/feasts at this time of year. Both Stonehenge and some of the timber monuments at Durrington Walls were built to align with the midwinter and midsummer 5. moon/sun movements.

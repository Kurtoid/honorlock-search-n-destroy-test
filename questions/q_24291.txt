Long Answer: Write 6-8 sentences (one-two small paragraphs). Since the texts aren't included here on this page, I don't expect quotes. However, you should do your best to summarize or paraphrase from memory to support your answer.   In James Joyce's short story "Araby" and T. S. Eliot's dramatic monologue "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," compare the boy and the man.  One feature of modern poetry or storytelling is to focus on the internal thoughts and feelings of a character. How do these two characters reflect modernist concerns/themes? How are their experiences similar and yet also different with regards to their interaction with the women in the poems (i.e. the friend's sister and the women in the room)?
The production of nitric oxide is governed by the following reaction: 4NH3(g) + 5O2(g) - 4NO(g) + 6H2O(g). If the rate at which NO is produced is 6.35 x 10-2 mol L-1s-1, at what rate is O2 consumed?

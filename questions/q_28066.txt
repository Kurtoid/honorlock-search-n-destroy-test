Suppose the following table illustrates the ages for a number of participants projected to enroll into a clinical trial looking at early onset of dementia.       Patient   Age     A   64     B   57     C   58     D   53     E   71     F   54     G   63       A)  Assuming that these participants can be considered to be normally distributed, and that they come from a population with a s=4.3 years, calculate a 99% confidence interval for the mean age of the population for which they represent. B)  With the same assumptions listed above, calculate a 90% confidence interval for the mean age of the population for which they represent. C)  Compare the precision of the two confidence intervals.

Euparkeria is a rare disease. The symptoms are not clear at first, but grow worse as time progresses. There is a test which detects Euparkeria early, and allows treatment to start before the symptoms become serious. Note that the symbol 'Pos' indicates a positive result on the test. The symbol E indicates that the patient has Euparkeria. The symbol indicates that the patient does not have Euparkeria. Note: Ec is "E complement"               Pr (Pos| E) = .920                      Pr (E) = .0456                What is Pr (E | Pos)?               Pr (Pos| Ec) = .028                  Note: Pr (E) + Pr (Ec) =1

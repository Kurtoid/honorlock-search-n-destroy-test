Some students have been told that people remember words that are written in green ink better than red ink. Therefore, I collected data from 3 sections of Psych 202. My 1:00 pm class had a list of words in blue ink to memorize. My 2:30 pm class had a list of words in green ink to memorize. My 4:00 pm class had a list of words in red ink to memorize. After a delay, student recalled as many words as they could. MBlue = 22, MGreen = 20, and MRed = 18. All classes had 20 students in each class and the SSTotal = 1085. Use the 7 steps of hypothesis testing to conduct an ANOVA that explores if ink color influences memory recall and use an a = .01. 1) IV: [IV] DV: [DV] number of tails: [tails] 2) State Hypotheses: Null: [Null] Alternative: [Alternative] 3) What is your critical value? [critical] 4) Calculate the appropriate test statistic. Show your work. Numerator = [Numerator] Denominator = [Denominator] Final obtained test statistic = [TestStat] 5) Decision: [Decision] 6) Effect size: Calculation/work: [Calculation] Final effect size value = [Effect] 7) Plain English interpretation: [PE] APA statistical information: [APA]

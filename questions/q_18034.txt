You are looking through the center of a solenoid in such a way that a 0.01 A current is going through it in a counter-clockwise direction from your point of view. The solenoid is cylindrical: 10 cm long and 2 cm wide, with the wire looping around it 2500 times.   From your point of view, in what direction is the magnetic field in the middle of the solenoid? [2]  What is the magnitude of the magnetic field in the middle of the solenoid? [4]
Assume a 32-bit Architecture a) Show how you would create a union consisting of the following items, called State and used to defined a variable of this type called MyState and what is the size of this union type 1) a bit field, called Operation with the bit0 -> STOP, bit1->START, bit2->RIGHT, bit3->LEFT and bit4-6->SPEED, bit7->STATUS 2) float, called Time 3) an int array of 10 elements, called Slots 4) a character array of 20 elements, called Name 5) an char, called Ty, which holds a character to indicate what field in the union is currently set, the allowable values are 'o' for Operation, 't' for Time, 's' for Slot and 'n' for Name   Question:Show union called State and define a variable from this union called MyState, also what is the actual size of the union.   b) Given the union type and union variable defined above, show how you would perform the following actions (don't forget the Ty) : Question: First set the Name field to "Version 1.0", then set Operation to START, RIGHT and SPEED = 10   c) Given the actions performed in b, what would the results be for the following statements: MyState.Ty='s'; printf("%d, (int) MyState.Time);   _________________________________________

Suppose a group is interested in determining whether teenagers obtain their drivers licenses at approximately the same average age across the country. Suppose that data are randomly collected from five teenagers in each region of the country.  The numbers represent the age at which teenagers obtained their drivers licenses.  An ANOVA was performed to determine whether or not significant differences exist among the mean ages for the five different regional groups.  Assume a = 0.05.  The partially completed ANOVA Table is located below.

(Use the insert table function to do so) What would be the null hypothesis in this study?  (you must enter the parameters or no credit will be given for the hypotheses -- you can use the equation editor to insert symbols/Greek letters) What would be the alternate hypothesis? What is your F-critical value What is the decision rule for this test? Is there a significant difference between the groups? Why or why not?  Explain and/or Show your work. Conclusion: Interpret your answer in Language of the Problem. From the ANOVA table, can you conclude if one group had an average lower age than the others?

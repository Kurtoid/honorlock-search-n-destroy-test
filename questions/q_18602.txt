A pair of vertical, open-ended glass tubes inserted into a horizontal pipe are often used together to measure flow velocity in the pipe, a configuration called a Venturi meter. Consider such an arrangement with a horizontal pipe carrying water (density of water is 1000 kg/m3). Water rises to heights h1=16.0 cm and h2=8.00 cm in the two open-ended tubes as shown above. The cross-sectional area of the pipe is A1 at the position of tube 1, and A2 at the position of tube 2. A1=3A2. a) (2p) What is the gauge pressure at position of tube 2? b) (5p) Type in the Bernoulli equation applicable to this situation. (You should have only two unknowns, v1 and v2). c) (3p) Find v2.

Based on the quotation below, break down the legal test that the defendant must meet in order to successfully assert the defence of voluntary assumption of risk (volenti or volens): 14  The Supreme Court of Canada delineated the modern scope of the volenti defence in Lehnert v. Stein, [1963] S.C.R. 38 at 44, 36 D.L.R. (2d) 159, quoting with approval the following passage from Glanville Williams, Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence (1951) at 308: It is submitted that the key to an understanding of the true scope of the volens maxim lies in drawing a distinction between what may be called physical and legal risk. Physical risk is the risk of damage in fact; legal risk is the risk of damage in fact for which there will be no redress in law.   [...]   To put this in general terms, the defence of volens does not apply where as a result of a mental process the plaintiff decides to take a chance but there is nothing in his conduct to show a waiver of the right of action communicated to the other party. To constitute a defence, there must have been an express or implied bargain between the parties whereby the plaintiff gave up his right of action for negligence.   15  The Supreme Court of Canada revisited volenti most recently in Hall v. Hebert, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 159, 101 D.L.R. (4th) 129 [Hall cited to S.C.R.]. Madam Justice McLachlin stated for the majority that: "The defence of volenti is available only if it can be established that the plaintiff, with knowledge (objectively determined) of the risk, freely accepted it. [...] It is narrowly applied" (at 173).

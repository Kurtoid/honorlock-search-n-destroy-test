In a small park there is a population of 375 mice that are either brown or white in color.  Of this population, in which brown is dominant to white, approximately 152 individuals are white.  Assuming that the population is at equilibrium for this gene/locus, answer the following.  Part A: Calculate the allele frequencies and genotype frequencies (p,2pq, etc.).  Perform all calculations to three decimal places.   (Note: you will NOT be scored on part A, but your work in part A, will be required to do Part B.)   Part B: BONUS: After the previous predictions were made, actual samples were obtained from all individuals in the population described above.  Genetic analyses were done, and it was found that of those that were brown, 40 are homozygous dominant and 183 are heterozygous.    Is the population above at equilibrium? Use the chi-square test to determine this.   (The chi-square formula and chart is shown below the questions for convenience.) Answer the following:  1. What was the chi-square value? 2. What was the df (degree of freedom) that you used? 3. Did you accept or reject the hypothesis? Why? 4. Is the population at equilibrium? Why or why not?

An increase in blood pressure is detected by receptors in the blood vessels that sense the resistance of blood flow against the vessel walls. The receptors relay a message to the brain, which in turn sends a message to the effectors, the heart and blood vessels. The heart rate decreases and blood vessels increase in diameter, which cause the blood pressure to fall back within the normal range or set point. Conversely, if blood pressure decreases, the receptors relay a message to the brain, which in turn causes the heart rate to increase, and the blood vessels to decrease in diameter. Some set points become "reset" under certain conditions. For instance, during exercise, the blood pressure normally increases. This increase is not abnormal; it is the body's response to the increased demand of oxygen by muscle tissues. When the muscles require more oxygen, the body responds by increasing the blood flow to muscle tissues, thereby increasing blood pressure. This resetting of the normal homeostatic set point is required to meet the increased demand of oxygen by muscles.

6. (4 pts) Solve the equation:
The following circuit will be used for all parts of this question. (4 points each)  (a) When the frequency of the source is very small (approaching zero), which line has a non-negligible current? (b) When the frequency of the source is very large (approaching infinity), which line has a non-negligible current? (c) When the frequency of the source is exactly at resonance frequency, which line would have the largest measurable, maximum current? (In this case maximum current implies the amplitude of the current wave.) (d) When the frequency of the source is greater than resonance frequency, which line would have the smallest measurable, maximum current? (In this case maximum current implies the amplitude of the current wave.)

A zero-coupon Treasury bond (considered risk-free) costs $766 today and will be paying a par of $1000 in 10 years. A second zero-coupon bond with the same par and maturity, issued by Firm F, is worth $614. What is the risk premium of firm F?

Granny Sweet makes hot sauce. The hot sauce is sold in 4 ounce bottles. Due to legal considerations, the average (m) fill on each bottle must be approximately 4 ounces.  96 bottles are opened and measured with the result that the average fill is 3.94 ounces. From past experience the standard deviation (s) of the fill is .42 ounces. Given this information is the average fill of hot sauce bottles significantly less than 4 ounces at the a = .05 level? The null hypothesis to test this contention is m = 4.0, and the alternative hypothesis to test this contention is m < 4.0. Is the average fill significantly less than 4 ounces at the a=.05 level?

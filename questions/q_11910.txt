11. In 2004, a random sample of 46 coyotes in a region of northern Minnesota showed the average age to be 2.05 years with a standard deviation of 0.82 years.  However, it is thought that the overall population mean age of coyotes is 1.75 years.  Test the hypothesis that coyotes in this region of northern Minnesota live longer than the average of 1.75 years.  (While answering the following sub-parts of this question, you will be including the null and alternative hypothesis, the test statistic, the p-value (a visualization and an interpretation), your statistical decision, and your conclusion in the context of the problem.) (a) What type of hypothesis test is this (think Step 1)?

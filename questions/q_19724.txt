A long, straight wire with a gauge (circular diameter) of 10 mm carries a current of 1.0 Amps. Use Ampere's law to answer the following: 1. Calculate the magnetic field at a radial distance of 15 mm away from the center axis of the wire.  2. Calculate the magnetic field at a radial distance of 1 mm away from the center axis of the wire, but still inside the wire.  3. How is the calculation of the magnetic field different if the point is inside instead of outside the wire?

[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).] A 735-N man is standing on a scale in an elevator which is moving downward with an initial speed of 7.0 m/s, and 3.0 seconds later, is moving downward at 15 m/s. a. Draw a clearly labeled free body diagram showing all the forces acting on the man.  b. Draw a clearly labeled dot diagram for the man's motion. c. Calculate the normal force acting on the man during the time described above (what does the scale read, in Newtons).  d. Then the elevator stops accelerating, and starts decelerating (slowing down) at the same rate, and by now slows from 15 m/s to 7 m/s in 3 seconds.  During this time, draw the FBD, and calculate the normal force acting on the man (what does the scale say, in Newtons). Note: Be sure to choose a coordinate system and use it throughout this problem. [Enter the answers for c and d in the box below.  Immediately following the exam, you will upload your work for all four parts, including your FBDs, with your coordinate system clearly labeled]   Your Answer:

The parasympathetic nervous system innervates the heart's SA node, with increased activity causing the heart rate to [HeartRate]. The parasympathetic stimulus begins in the cardiovascular regulatory center in the [BrainstemLocation], and then action potentials propagate toward the heart along an axon in [Presynaptic] nerve. In contrast to the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic ganglion is located [GanglionLocation]. At the ganglion, the presynaptic neuron releases [PresynapticNT], which crosses the synapse and binds to [PostsynapticR] receptors. This causes [PotentialChange] of the postsynaptic membrane. The postsynaptic neuron releases [PostsynapticNT], which crosses the synapse and binds to [EffectorR] receptors on the SA node, which are [EffectorRType].

The following are the main steps in the generation of an action potential i.sodium channels are inactivated ii.voltage-regulated potassium channels open and potassium moves out of the cell initiating repolarization iii.sodium channels regain their normal properties iv.a graded depolarization brings an area of excitable membrane to threshold v.a temporary hyperpolarization occurs vi.sodium channel activation occurs vii.sodium ions enter the cell and depolarization occurs The proper sequence of these events is

Of the 100 absent for less than ten days during their sixth grade school year, 10 did not obtain a high school diploma (or GED) as of 2010. *Given the hunch/belief that absenteeism in the early grades makes it difficult for students to keep up with the required work and is often a sign of other family issues that often pose challenges to academic progress of students,  formulate a hypothesis between the two specific variables of interest in this case.  *Using whether or not the student obtained a high school diploma (or GED) as the dependent variable, construct a crosstab/contingency table for assessing the relationship between whether or not obtained a high school diploma (or GED) and absence level in the sixth grade.   (Note: you don't need a perfectly drawn table;  just be sure to present the appropriate numbers and percentages with appropriately labelled columns and rows or the equivalent) *From an appropriate test of statistical significance, the p-value for the above display is .01;  in the context of this display what does this mean (include brief reference to two of the percentages as part of this answer)? *Given the above data, are the statistical results so far consistent or inconsistent with the hypothesis?

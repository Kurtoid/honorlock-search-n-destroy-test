You are the project manager for Justen Tyme Earthmovers.  You have a contract to grade a site for a new greenfield office park in Anniston, AL in late spring where the average expected rainfall impact for that time is 5 days per month.  The earthwork on the project involves cutting the top off a large hill, hauling the cut to the valley below, and ultimately compacting the cut material to make a level site for the office campus.  You are required to compact the soil in the new location.  The average haul distance is 4000 feet.  The entire haul road is contained on your project site.  The quantity of cut is 850,000 CY.  You are required to complete the project in 35 workdays. GIVEN:  Soil Type: Silty Sand (SM) Distance from center of mass of cut to center of mass of fill area is 4000 feet Average slope: 4% Assume 9-hour work day Assume 7 day work week Assume 50 minute working hour Assume average digging conditions Your Available Equipment Fleet: (These are the types of equipment that you own.  You can use as many or as few as you need unless restricted by the problem)  CAT 637E Scraper Series II (Push Pull) (capacity: 40 LCY per load) CAT D9 Dozer CAT D8 Dozer CAT D5 Dozer CAT 300D Articulated Truck (Off Road Dump) (Capacity: 21.5 LCY per load)  25 mph when loaded 35 mph when unloaded   CAT 140H Motor Grader CAT 825G Compactor Water Truck (Use hourly rate for a CAT 250E Articulated Truck)      1.

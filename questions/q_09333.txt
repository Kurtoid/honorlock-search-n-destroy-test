Hypothetical: Joanna is a 21-year old law student in her first trimester of pregnancy.  Although originally very uncertain, she has decided to have an abortion.  When she arrived on the date of her scheduled appointment and parked, she noticed that there was a group of persons from a pro-life organization that were handing out pamphlets and speaking to the women approaching the facility on the public side-walk outside the facility.  She was not approached by anyone nor was she afraid for her safety but felt uncomfortable and drove home.  She did some research and found that the law in her county establishes a buffer zone around abortion facilities.  It states that all persons who are not patients, employees within the course and scope of employment entering the facility, emergency personnel, individuals providing contracted or county services to the facility or those passing by or in transit to another destination must stay at least 6 feet from all persons entering the facility.  A separate provision subjects to criminal punishment anyone who "knowingly obstructs, detains, hinders, impedes or blocks another person's entry to or exit from a reproductive health care facility."  Joanna does not want to be approached by anyone not associated with the facility. She is certain about her decision and feels that the 6-foot limitation even on the sidewalk interferes with her right to choose an abortion.  She does not want to be that close to someone that is trying to change her mind.  She has taken Constitutional Law and has now filed a lawsuit claiming that the law as written imposes an undue burden on her right.   Question:  YOU ARE ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WHICH MUST DECIDE THIS CASE:  Does the 6 foot buffer zone impose an undue burden on Joanne's Constitutional right to an abortion? Why or why not? Detail your analysis.  CITE TO APPLICABLE CASES DISCUSSED IN CLASS.

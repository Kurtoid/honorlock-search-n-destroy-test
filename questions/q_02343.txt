In Table 2 (page 474) they show the impact of a factor (e.g. age, gender, arrest history, etc.) on various forms of income. Note that some entries have asterisks next to them, which correspond to p-values (see just below the table). Note that "substance use disorder" in connection with "no work income" has a p-value of less than 0.001, while "substance use disorder" in connection with "informal sources only" has a p-value > 0.05 (since there are no asterisks, so the p-value must be 0.05 or bigger). Explain in a few sentences what that tells us about the connection between substance use disorder and income sources. Note that you are expected to have read enough of the paper to understand what is means by "no work income", "formal sources only", and "informal sources only". The answer should be in your own words, not copy-pasted from the paper.

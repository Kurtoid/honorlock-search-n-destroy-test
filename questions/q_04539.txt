Tachycardia means:
The Precision Scientific Instrument Company manufactures thermometers that are supposed to give readings of  at the freezing point of water. Tests on a large sample of these thermometers reveal that at the freezing point of water, some give readings below  (denoted by negative numbers) and some give readinbove  (denoted by positive numbers). Assume that the mean reading is  and the standard deviation of the readings is  Also assume that the frequency distribution of errors closely resembles the normal distribution. A thermometer is randomly selected and tested. Find the temperature reading corresponding to the given information.A quality control analyst wants to examine thermometers that give readings in the bottom 4%. Find the reading that separates the bottom 4% from the others.
It is most probable that should not make an ado about it, for I can do without them. All machines have their friction; and possibly does enough good to counter balance the evil. At any rate, it is a great evil to make a stir about it. But when the friction comes to have its machine, and oppression and robbery are organized, I say, let us not have such a machine any longer. Thoreau compares government to a machine. Read the dictionary entry for the word "friction." Friction (noun) 1.) surface resistance to relative motion, as of sliding or rolling; 2.) the rubbing of the surface of one body against that of another; 3.) dissention or conflict between persons, nations etc., because of differing ideas, wishes, etc. What does Thoreau mean when he uses the term "friction" in the passage above?

Problem #1 (20 minutes; 25 points) Use the information below to answer the following questions related to lease accounting. Show your work to enable me to provide you with partial credit, and clearly label your answer. On January 1, 2019, the Smith Building Company (SBC) leased equipment with an economic life of 5 years from the Novak Equipment Company (NEC). The lease contains the following terms and provisions:  The lease has a term of 4 years, and the equipment has an economic life of 5 years. The annual rental payment is $50,000, payable at the end of each year. The interest rate implicit in the lease is 10% and is known to SBC. The equipment has an unguaranteed residual value of $15,000. The fair value of the equipment is $168,738.45. The present value of the unguaranteed residual value is $10,245.20. Both SBC and NEC use the straight-line method to depreciate similar equipment.  The present value factors are as follows (n is the number of periods): Table 3 "The Present Value of $1"    Table 4 "The Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity"       Table 5 "The Present Value of an Annuity Due"

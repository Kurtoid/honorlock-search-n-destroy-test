Glycemic Index (GI) is a scale that ranks carbohydrates by how much they raise blood glucose levels compared to a reference food. Below is the GI of food with the reference of glucose:    Lentils 32 Carrots, boiled 39 Yogurt, fruit 41   Peaches, canned 43 Potato, instant mash 87 Brown rice, boiled 68    Glycemic load measures the degree of glycemic response and insulin demand produced by a specific amount of a specific food. Glycemic load reflects both the quality and the quantity of dietary carbohydrates (CHO).                          GL = GI/100 x CHO (grams) per serving  For each meal the Glycemic Load ranking is listed below:    Low                             0 - 10    Moderate              11 - 19    High                           20 +    Amy has 0.3 lb mashed potato (15% is CHO) and 2 oz fruit yogurt (19% is CHO) and 40 g of canned peaches (14.5% is CHO) for her lunch. Using the information above, (a) (6pts)Calculate the Glycemic Load(GL) for her lunch (1 decimal) (b)(2pts) Determine whether her lunch is low, moderate or high glycemic load. (c) (2pts)If Amy would like to lower the GL of her lunch, what is your suggestion?
When muscle tension develops but the load is not moved.

Use the picture, variables, and problem setup from here to answer this and the following three questions. The answer to part a is the answer to this question. The following parts are answered in questions 18, 19, and 20. Charged particles of mass   = +[m] mg enter a region of space with crossed electric and magnetic fields arranged as shown as a velocity selector.  In this velocity selector,  the electric field is directed down on the page and has a magnitude of  = [E] kN/C. The magnetic field in the velocity selector is directed into the page and has a magnitude of  = [B1] mT. The plates of the selector have a length

The system consists of two massless pulleys (C and D) and two masses (mA = [mA] kg and mB = [mB] kg).  An inextensible, massless cable connect mass A to the fixed point located at E. Gravity acts downward, as shown. Friction between mass A and the surface is modeled using the coefficient of kinetic friction that equals [muk]. Write the equations that would be required to solve for the accelerations of both masses. (These equations could be used to obtain numerical values for both accelerations.) You are not required to solve any of these equations; just write all that would be necessary. There is nothing for you to write in the box below. Your answer will be graded from your written work. Include properly labeled free-body diagram(s) with your solution.

The following information is available on a depreciable asset owned by Omaha Bank:     Purchase date July 1, Year 1   Purchase price $85,000   Salvage value $10,000   Useful life 10 years   Depreciation method straight-line    The asset's book value is $70,000 on July 1, Year 3. On that date, management determines that the asset's salvage value should be $5,000 rather than the original estimate of $10,000. Based on this information, the amount of depreciation expense the company should recognize during the last six months of Year 3 would be:

Component/Deployment Diagram Exercise (10 points): Draw a component/deployment diagram for the following scenario. Buyers interested in real-estate listings connect to a Real_Estate_Server at the real estate agency from their personal computers using TCP/IP protocol. When they connect to this server, they do so through a BuyerInterface software component that's installed in their personal computers. The BuyerInterface component interacts with the Listing Interface in the Real_Estate_Server. This Listing Interface is an interface of the Listing_Processor software component. The Listing_Processor component retrieves listing information from MultipleListings database that is also stored in the Real_Estate_Server. Once a listing has been selected, the buyer connects to the Bank_Server through the same BuyerInterface using TCP/IP protocol. The BuyerInterface connects to the Bank_Server through MortgageApplicationInterface, which is an interface of the MortgageApplication software component. The MortgageApplication software component retrieves necessary information from the CustomerDB that is also in the BankServer. We are interested in modeling one Real_Estate_Server and one BankServer, which are each accessed by several buyers.

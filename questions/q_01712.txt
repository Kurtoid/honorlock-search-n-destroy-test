Dislocation intersection influences the mobility of dislocations in the lattice.  Below shows the interaction of a screw dislocation (b1, oriented along Z direction) with an edge dislocation (b2, oriented along X direction).  Please answer the following questions: (a) Draw the shapes of dislocation b1 and the dislocation b2 after the interaction (b) Define the steps created by the interaction on both b1 and b2. Is it kink or jog? (c) Define the type of dislocation for each segment on both b1 and b2 after interaction (d) If shear stress tYX is applied, determine the motion of the dislocations or their segments.  Assuming all planes, XY, YZ, ZX, can serve as slip planes.

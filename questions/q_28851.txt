Question 2 A transportation student is driving on a rural road with a speed limit of 55mph for the mountainous segment and 60mph for the level segment. Use Practical Stopping Distance and assume common/typical values for some unknown variables such as ,  and  . (a) Assume the student is driving at the speed limit. If the stopping sight distance required to avoid colliding with a fallen boulder on a mountain pass is 530 feet, what is the likely grade of the mountainous segment of roadway? [v1] (to the nearest 0.001) Is it the uphill or downhill? [v2]   (b) The student claims that the level segment of this road can be safely negotiated at 70mph in rainy weather. Because of the winding nature of the road, one stretch of level pavement has a stopping sight distance of only 550 ft.  What would be the associated reaction time for the driving speed of 70mph as claimed by the student? [v3] sec (to the nearest 0.01)
Which of the following is NOT one of the stages/sections of the Road Map?
You may draw this representation or show it using this virtual manipulative.

The graph of s = f(t) represents the position of an object moving along a line at time t>0 (s in meters, t in seconds). s (m)When is the object moving in the negative direction?
A 30.0 kg block is attached to a very light horizontal spring of force constant 500 N/m and is resting on a frictionless horizontal table. (See Figure below) Suddenly it is struck by a 3.00 kg stone traveling horizontally at 8.00 m/s to the right, whereupon the stone rebounds at 2.00 m/s horizontally to the left. Find the maximum distance that the block will compress the spring after the collision. (Hint: Break this problem into two parts-- the collision and the behavior after the collision--and apply the appropriate conservation law to each part.)

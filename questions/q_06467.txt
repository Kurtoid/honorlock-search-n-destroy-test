Suicide by Cop   A 19-year-old college student and problem gambler was pulled over by police on the Long Island Expressway for driving erratically. He pulled out a toy handgun, pointed it at the officer, and was shot and killed. In a separate incident, a 45-year-old cancer patient was shot by Jersey City police when he entered a pizza shop in which two officers were eating and pulled a gun on them. These incidents are difficult to explain because they do not appear to be random acts of passion, rage, or felony. As one officer put it, "Why would you point a gun at a police officer," unless you wanted to be shot?  Some experts believe that incidents such as these are forms of "suicide by cop," where individuals force police to shoot at them in situations that normally would not involve threat or force. Studies have found that many of these shooting victims are white males in their 20s with a history of alcohol or drug abuse--a profile similar to suicide victims in general who are prone to suffer from depression, hopelessness, and deteriorating personal relationships. The use of police to carry out a death wish is difficult to explain, but suicide is often difficult for a person to carry out, and using a police officer removes the burden from the individual. Also, life insurance policies do not pay for suicide victims and most religions forbid suicide, making it more problematic for a person to consider. There are no statistics, but it is estimated that up to 10 percent of fatal police shootings are provoked by those actively seeking to die.66  Evaluate the moral justice of "suicide by cop."  Or Internet Sex Stings   The use of undercover police working anonymously online as bait in Internet chats has become routine in some places. The purpose is to trap those looking for underage sex online. The Indiana Court of Appeals has ruled, however, that attempted sexual misconduct with a minor, a felony, requires that the victim actually be a minor and that an undercover officer therefore doesn't count. The Court used that reasoning to reverse a conviction for sexual misconduct, so the suspect was convicted only of child solicitation (a lesser felony). The offender, age 48, has been arrested after he appeared at an Indianapolis apartment with rope and condoms in his pockets after explicit online chats with an undercover police officer posing as 15-year-old "Samantha." The dissenting judge in this appellate case argued that all charges should stand against the suspect. "He did all he believed was necessary to complete the offense of sexual misconduct of a minor," and he failed to carry out the offense "only because it was not possible under the circumstances." Prosecutors argue that online stings protect teenagers by snaring likely perpetrators, although judges often give reduced sentences or even probation because there are no actual victims in these cases.70 *  Evaluate the moral code of the Court's decision to limit the scope of online liability in undercover cases of sexual solicitation of minors.

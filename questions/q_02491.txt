(25 minutes) The core region of a water-cooled nuclear reactor has a 2-m long circular coolant channel with a diameter of 15 mm. The channel wall is subjected to a heat flux of 106 W/m2. The coolant (water) has an inlet mass flow rate of 0.3 kg/s and temperature of 227degC. What is the channel surface temperature at the exit? Where necessary, use the simplest applicable correlation. Ignore any potential entrance length effects and fluid property variations. Water properties: cp = 4664 J/kg-K, k = 0.65 W/m-K, m = 1.176 x 10-4 kg/m-s, r = 831 kg/m3, Pr = 0.84

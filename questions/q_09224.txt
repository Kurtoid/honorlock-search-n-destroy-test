The table below presents long run macroeconomic data for 2 hypothetical nations A & B:     Economic Performance Indicators   A   B     Nominal GDP growth   15%   7%     Inflation   10%   2%     Nominal Interest rate   4%   4%     Unemployment rate   12%   5%     Population growth rate   1.5%   2.5%     Assume that both nations start with real GDP of $3,000 per citizen. Calculate and type the answers that would fill the blanks below, assuming that the data above apply for every year considered. Use the approximations formula: Economic growth = %D in nominal GDP - %D in price level - %D in population and the compounding formula P(1+r)n where P is the current amount, r is the rate (in decimal) and n is years, where applicable.  .      A   B     Economic growth rate   [EGRA]   [EGRB]     Years required for real per capita GDP to double  [YRSA]  [YRSB]      Real per capita GDP 140 years later (correct to 2 decimal places)   [RGDPA]   [RGDPB]

Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr A sample of gas collected at 21.0degC and 660 mm Hg, has a volume of 1.83 liters. What will the pressure of the gas be if the temperature is increased to 38.0degC and the volume is reduced to1.50 liters? To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem.  Show your work (equation/and units) by using the equation editor () in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use   to insert ratios. Be sure to include proper units and the final answer! Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

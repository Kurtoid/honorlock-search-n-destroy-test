Make a labeled sketch of a parallel-plate capacitor with a plate area of 0.02 m2, a capacitance of 300 pF, and a Voltage difference of 12 V between the plates. Your dimensions do not need to be accurate--they only need to be labeled accurately. [2] In your sketch for part A, in what direction is the electric field in the center of your parallel plate capacitor? [1] Find the distance between the plates of your parallel-plate capacitor. [3] Find the magnitude of the electric field at the center of your parallel-plate capacitor. [3] Find the amount of electrical energy that is stored in your parallel-plate capacitor. [3]

Please use the Heparin Protocol to answer the questions. WEIGHT ADJUSTED HEPARIN PROTOCOLLab Orders:  STAT: PT, INR, PTT, CBC  STAT: PTT 6 hours after any Heparin BOLUS or rate adjustment.  PTT every 6 hours until two (2) consecutive PTTs are therapeutic (46 to 70). Then change PTT to every 24 hours.  Stop Heparin infusion if platelet count is less than 100,000 or platelet count drops by 50% pre-Heparin level, and notify healthcare provider.   STEPS IN CALCULATING HEPARIN DOSAGE (INITIAL DOSAGE)  Change weight in pounds to kilograms.  Calculate IV Bolus Heparin at 80 units/kg (80 units per kg).   On hand: Heparin 5000 units/1 ml   Calculate IV Heparin continuous infusion at 18 units/kg/hr (18 units per kg per hr).   On hand: Heparin continuous infusion 25,000 units in 250 ml D5W.  Adjust Heparin infusion rate based on the sliding scale below (after the initial dosing and based upon subsequent PTTs):       PTT   UNITS OF HEPARIN      90    STOP Heparin for 1 hour, Then reduce Heparin infusion by 3 units/kg/hr.        A 217 lb patient is currently on a Heparin drip at {x} ml/hr. The current lab is: PTT 42. The new infusion rate will be ___________ ml/hr. Record your answer using 1 decimal place(s). Enter only a number in the blank.

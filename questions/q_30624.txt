Write a function called report_running_sum that takes the name of a file as a parameter. This file contains a sequence of real numbers. Your function should print the running sum of the numbers followed by the maximum running sum. This means that the n-th number that you report should be the sum of the first n numbers in the file and the maximum that you report should be the largest such value that you report. For example if the file contains the following data: 3.25 4.5 -8.25 7.25 3.5 4.25 -6.5 5.25 The function should produce the following output: running sum = 3.25 7.75 -0.50 6.75 10.25 14.50 8.00 13.25 max sum = 14.50 The first number reported is the same as the first number in the file (3.25). The second number reported is the sum of the first two numbers in the file (3.25 + 4.5). The third number reported is the sum of the first three numbers in the file (3.25 + 4.5 + -8.25). And so on. The maximum of these values is 14.50, which is reported on the second line of output. You are to exactly reproduce the format of this output, including printing exactly 2 numbers after the decimal point. You may assume that there is at least one number to read. You may not construct any extra data structures to solve this problem.

Researchers are interested in the potential effects of stress on memory processes. The researchers collected data on student performance on a memory test. Students were asked to memorize 60 words. After 24hrs students had to recall as many words as possible. An hour before each memory test was administered students received an injection of placebo or cortisone (a stress hormone). Each student was tested twice, once with the placebo and once with cortisone. Does stress (cortisone) affect memory?  Perform a two-sample t-test and a paired t-test for the data in the memory data. Submit the test statistic (ts), the degrees of freedom (df), the p-value, and state your conclusion (reject null or fail to reject null, a = 0.05) for each test.  Two-sample t-test  Test statistic (ts)  [ts1] Degrees of freedom (df)   [df1] P-value [pv1] Conclusion  [cons1]   Paired t-test  Test statistic (ts)  [ts2] Degrees of freedom (df)  [df2] P-value [pv2] Conclusion  [cons2]

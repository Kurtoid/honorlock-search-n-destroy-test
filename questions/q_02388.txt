Arthur Dent suffered bouts of mental illness. He was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and experienced auditory and visual hallucinations. The auditory hallucinations were command hallucinations, that is, the voices he heard ordered him to do things. While suffering from these hallucinations he might appear quite normal, oriented to time and space although he might also appear subdued or agitated. During one of these periods he became convinced that he was compelled by the maleficent space construction supervisor Vogon Jeltz to follow his directions or the world would be destroyed to make way for a space highway. Following this command Dent walked into the Fifth Precinct police station and told the desk sergeant that five years ago he murdered his friend Ford Prefect, incinerated the remains and sprinkled the ashes in the garden. The sergeant was understandably astounded. He asked Dent to sit down and he proceeded to ask him questions about the crime. Dent appeared coherent and rational. He provided details of the event and at the conclusion of his account the sergeant said "Well, I'm going to have to arrest you." Dent was placed in a cell and 15 minutes later Detective Zaphod arrived and told Dent he wanted to ask him some questions. He read Dent his Miranda warnings and asked if he was willing to waive his rights. Dent said "Yes, I am here to do Vogon's will." He then answered questions and again confessed to killing Prefect. At the hearing to suppress both of the statements, uncontradicted expert testimony demonstrated that, at the time he spoke to both officers, Dent was in a psychotic state and suffering from serious mental illness. The experts explained the existence of the command hallucinations and that the hallucinations impacted Dent's volitional abilities and rendered him unable to make free and rational choices. They also testified that he was so detached from reality that he could not understand the Miranda rights. The trial court should:

The molecule 2,3-biphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) regulates the oxygen binding affinity of hemoglobin. The graph below shows the oxygen binding curves for hemoglobin in the presence of 2,3-BPG both at normal levels (red, middle) and at high levels (green, right), as well as in the absence of 2,3-BPG (blue, left). The partial pressure of oxygen both in the lungs and in the tissues are indicated (in mmHg).   Blank #1: What type of effector is 2,3-BPG? (positive/negative, homotropic/heterotropic) Blank #2: How much oxygen (%) is delivered to the tissues by hemoglobin with normal levels of 2,3-BPG? Blank #3: How much oxygen (%) is delivered to the tissues by hemoglobin when there is no 2,3-BPG present? Blank #4: Compared to normal levels of 2,3-BPG, how much more/less oxygen (%) is delivered to the tissues when there is no 2,3-BPG? Your answer should state "xx% more/less oxygen is delivered to the tissues". Blank #5: In addition to 2,3-BPG, name two other effectors (making sure you state whether you have higher or lower concentrations of that effector) that would shift the "normal" red binding curve of hemoglobin to the left (blue). Your answer should be something like: Higher/lower concentration of ____, higher/lower concentration of ____.

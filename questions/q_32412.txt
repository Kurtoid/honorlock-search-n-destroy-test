Dong Zhongshu, a scholar who lived during the Han dynasty in China, wrote the following: Heaven's constant desire is to love and bring benefit, its task to nurture. Spring, fall, winter, and summer are the instruments it uses. The king also makes loving and bringing benefit his constant desire and his task is to bring peace and happiness to his age. Love and hate, joy and anger, are the instruments he uses. His love, hate, joy, and anger are like Heaven's seasons. It is through changes in temperature that things are transformed and completed. If Heaven produces these plants and animals in the right season, then the year will be one of abundance, but if at the wrong time, then the year will be a bad one. Similarly, if the ruler expresses his four emotions in accord with moral principles, then the world will be well governed, but if not, the age will be chaotic. Thus an orderly age is like a good harvest, a disorderly age is like a bad harvest. Thus one can see that the principles of man match the way of Heaven. According to Dong Zhongshu, what/who is to blame for chaos?

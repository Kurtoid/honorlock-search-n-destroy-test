III- Problems: 70 Points  The total resistance of a parallel circuit is 25 Ohms. What is the current through a 220 Ohms resistor that makes up part of the parallel circuit if the total current is 100 mA.   (10 Points)  From the circuit below, determine the resistance R2, R3 and R4.  (10 Points)      Determine all of the resistor values in the following figure. The RT = 773 W.  (10 Points)     Find the values of unspecified quantities (show in red) from the figure below such as IT, I2, I3, R1 & R2                                                                                                                                (10 Points)       Determine the total resistance RT between the terminals A and B of the following circuit. Also calculate the current in each branch (IT, I1, I2, I3, I4 & I5  ) with 10 V between A and B                                                                                            (15 Points)       Using the superposition theorem, solve for the current through R3 in the following figure                                                 (15 Points)

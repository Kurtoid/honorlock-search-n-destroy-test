SHOW YOUR WORK ON YOUR SCRATCH PAPER! Suppose that the price (P) and the number of bottles of champagne sold (B) are related by the following equation:  Determine the rate that the number of bottles of champagne is changing per week when the price of a bottle of champagne is $40, there are 50 bottles sold, and the price is decreasing by $2.00 per week. Complete the table:    P = [p] dP/dt = [dp]   B = [b] dB/dt = [db]    The (related rates) derivative is:  [deriv] The number of bottles of champagne is changing at a rate of  [rate]  [label].

(Continuing from the preceding question.) In a postsynaptic neuron of the parasympathetic nervous system that innervates the SA node, the arrival of action potentials produces [MembranePotentialChange] of the synaptic terminal membrane, which causes causes opening of voltage-gated [SynapticChannels] channels. The ions from these channels bind to proteins that stimulate fusion of [Fusion] with the presynaptic terminal membrane, releasing neurotransmitter onto the SA node. This has three effects on the SA node, all of which [CommonEffect] the time between heart beats: 1) it decreases If,, which [SlopeEffect] the slope of the phase 4 [Phase4Polarity]; 2) it opens [SANodeChannels], which makes the maximum diastolic potential more [MDPPolarity]; and it reduces ICa, which moves the [ICaEffect] to a more positive value.

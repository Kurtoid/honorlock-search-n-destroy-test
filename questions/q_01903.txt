Thermograms are shown below for copolymers of poly(phenylquinoline-block-polystyrene) and their homopolymers.  The TGA was run at 10oC/min in N2.     - Which homopolymer has a greater thermal stability, the polyphenylquinoline or the polystyrene? Fill in blank with PPQ or PS:   [1] - What is the onset degradation temperature of the polyphenylquinoline (PPQ). Fill in blank with choice of A thru E: [2]         (A) 450degC         (B) 500degC         (C) 625degC         (D) 700degC         (E) 750degC - What is the composition (wt%) of PPQ in the 3a composite? Fill in blank with choice of A thru E: [3]         (A) 5%         (B) 17%         (C) 24%         (D) 65%         (E) 76% - What is the composition (wt%) of polystyrene block in the 3a composite? Fill in blank with choice of A thru E: [4]          (A) 5%         (B) 17%         (C) 25%         (D) 65%         (E) 76% - If the sample were run at 50degC/min instead of 10degC/min, how would that affect the curve relative to the one shown? Would it shift to the left or right? [5]   - How would the PPQ curve change if the same sample was run in an oxygen atmosphere rather than nitrogen? Fill in blank with choice of A thru E: [6]      (A) It would likely degrade at a higher onset temperature, but have the same amount or less of char yield.      (B) It would likely degrade at a higher onset temperature, and have a greater amount of char yield.      (C) It would likely degrade at a lower onset temperature, but have the same amount or less of char yield.      (D) It would likely degrade at a same onset temperature, but have a lower amount of char yield.      (E) It would likely degrade at a lower onset temperature, and have a higher amount of char yield.

Normal z or Student t Distribution? Suppose that an accounting firm does a study to determine the time needed to complete one person's tax forms. It randomly surveys 100 people. The sample mean is 23.6 hours. There is a known standard deviation of 7.0 hours. The population distribution is assumed to be normal. Construct a 90% confidence interval for the population mean time to complete the tax forms. We will use the [f] (type z or t) distribution because the population standard deviation, s, is [g] (type KNOWN or UNKNOWN).   Construct the Confidence Interval: ([j], [k]) (Round to 2 decimal places.)   Conclusion: I am [l]% confident that the true population mean time to complete the tax forms is between [m] and [n].

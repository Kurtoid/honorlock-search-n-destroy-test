Example: The function f(x)=2x+3{"version":"1.1","math":"f(x)=2x+3"} , is a one-to-one function. Find its inverse.Solution:Step 1   Replace  f(x){"version":"1.1","math":"f(x)"} with  y{"version":"1.1","math":"y"}.              y=2x+3{"version":"1.1","math":"y=2x+3"}Step 2   Interchange x and y.              x=2y+3{"version":"1.1","math":"x=2y+3"}Step 3   Solve for y.               (y+3)x=2(y+3)*(y+3)1 x(y+3)=2 xy+3x=2 xy=2-3x y=2-3xx                  {"version":"1.1","math":"(y+3)x=2(y+3)*(y+3)1 x(y+3)=2 xy+3x=2 xy=2-3x y=2-3xx                  "}          Step 4   Replace  y{"version":"1.1","math":"y"}  with  f-1(x){"version":"1.1","math":"f-1(x)"}.              f-1(x)=-3x+2x{"version":"1.1","math":"f-1(x)=-3x+2x"}       Exercise: The function f(x)=51-x{"version":"1.1","math":"f(x)=51-x"} , is a one-to-one function.

At what age do babies learn to crawl? Does it take longer to learn in the winter when babies are often bundled in clothes that restrict their movement? Data were collected from parents who brought their babies into the University of Denver Infant Study Center to participate in one of a number of experiments between 1988 and 1991. Parents reported the age (in weeks) at which their child was first able to creep or crawl a distance of four feet within one minute. The resulting data were grouped by month of birth. The data are for January, May, and September. Birth Month       Average Crawling-Age           SD           n January                      29.84                             7.08          32 May                            28.58                             8.07         27 September                  33.83                             6.93        38 Crawling age is given in weeks. Assume that data are three independent simple random samples, one from each of the three populations (babies born in a particular month), and that the populations of crawling ages have Normal distributions. The overall mean response, x-bar, is
"Scalawags" was the derogatory term used to describe native white Republicans who lived in the South.
Directions: Your response must be written in full sentences at the college level. You may use the abbreviations v-g (voltage -gated) or c-g (chemically gated) in your discussion. Explain which channels on the membrane are active in part d on the diagram: --Tell which channels are functioning and their trigger. --Tell which ions are moving across the  membrane and WHY they are moving in this way (in other words, explain the electrochemical gradient in terms of how it affects the movement of these ions.

The dumping of toxic chemicals such as kepone, vinyl chloride, or mercury into the soil is known as criminal environmental pollution.
If we continue to burn fossil fuels at the current rate until they are used up, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 will peak at approximately 2100 ppm in ~2300AD.  After that the atmospheric concentration will start to decrease and ultimately stabilize due to the natural carbon cycle.   Explain (don't just list) at least 3 processes that will remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Include a statement about whether each process will happen over short (< a century), intermediate (hundreds to tens of thousands of years) or long time scales (a hundred thousand years or longer). What is the atmospheric concentration likely to be once it stabilizes? Roughly how long will it take to return to this concentration?  (Give me an order of magnitude estimate- will it take 1 yr, a billion yrs or something in between?)

To prevent timing attacks, Betty has changed her exponentiation implementation such that it always multiplies the result with something - with the message when the exponent's bit is 1, or with the value of 1 (thus not really modifying the result) when the exponent's bit is zero. In this code, exp, ctable[0] and ctable[1], and one are large numbers, each occupying tens of consecutive cache blocks.   // For each bit in the exponentfor(int bit_idx=nbits-1; bit_idx>=0; bit_idx--){   BN_sqr(res,res); // res=res*res;   // Get bit_idx'th bit from large number exp   bool bit= get_bit_at_index(exp,bit_idx);   if(bit)      BN_mul(res,res,ctable[1]); // res=res*msg   else      BN_mul(res,res,ctable[0]); // res=res*1} This still leaves the program vulnerable to Prime+Probe attacks. Betty can add Scater-Gather mitigation to prevent such attacks. Answer the following questions:  To which large-number values in the above code would Scatter-Gather need to be applied? If the first byte of the first affected large-number value was at address 0x100 in memory both before and after the Scatter-Gather was applied, at what address would the first byte of the second affected large-number value be after Scatter-Gather is applied? Explain your answer.

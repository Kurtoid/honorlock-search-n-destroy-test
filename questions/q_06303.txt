Which of the following is true regarding point source regulation? Check all that apply.
Remember we learned a "biological dose-response curve" that generally depicts the relationship between the biological function of a mineral and its dietary concentration. Please use text to describe what the deficiency, optical, and toxicity concentrations of a mineral in a diet are. Please also indicate that in which dietary concentration(s) a mineral could lead animal to death.

When the need arises to frequently create and destroy objects in a computer software such as a game, we can reuse objects to avoid fragmentation in memory.  Consider a game where the player can shoot projectiles with a button.  Rather than destroying the object on a collision or at a maximum range, we can instead deactivate it.   Create a Particle class along with a constructor initializing a particle with a position (x, y), a velocity (vx, vy), and a lifetime all in double format.  Additionally, include a boolean (alive) to determine if the particle will be updated and a pointer from each particle to the next particle.  Set the default values to 0, false, and the pointer to the next in the chain with NULL.  There are 5 doubles, 1 bool, and 1 pointer that are members of the class (instance variables). The first function you'll create is fill().  Given some int (n), it will continue to append a particle to the end of the current chain until there are a total of (n) particles.  Create a second function alive() which returns the number of particles that are alive.  Feel free to copy and paste the below template into your answer box and then fill it.        class Particle {    public:       // 1. Define member variables [1 point]       // 2. Declare constructor and member functions [1 point]};// 3. Define constructor [2 point]// 4. Add logic to the fill() method [3 points]Particle* Particle::fill(int n){    // returns the head which precedes n particles   // these will all have the default values }// 5. Add logic to count_alive() method [3 points]int Particle::count_alive(){   // this would return the number of alive particles}// 6. State the worst case time complexity of your fill() and count_alive() method [2 points]

EXHIBIT 3 A bicycle manufacturer is planning its production. It has assessed demand data for the next three months (see table below). With its current equipment, the company can build between 18,000 and 26,000 bicycles per month. The company has storage space that can hold maximum 10,000 bicycles. The cost of storing a bicycle is $10 per month. The inventory is empty at the beginning and end of the planning period. The production cost is estimated at $320 per bicycle. The company wants to find the optimal production schedule that minimizes its total cost. The decision variables are given as: B1 = Number of bicycles produced in Month 1 B2 = Number of bicycles produced in Month 2 B3 = Number of bicycles produced in Month 3 S1 = Number of bicycles in inventory at end of Month 1 S2 = Number of bicycles in inventory at end of Month 2      Demand Month 1 15,000 bicycles   Demand Month 2 21,000 bicycles   Demand Month 3 36,000 bicycles   Minimum production per month 18,000 bicycles   Maximum production per month 26,000 bicycles   Maximum storage capacity per month 10,000 bicycles   Production cost per bicycle 320 $/bicycle   Storage cost per bicycle per month 10 $/bicycle      Please solve the problem described in this Exhibit using the Excel Solver.

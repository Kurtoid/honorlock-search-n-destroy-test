If the starting concentration of the reactant is 8.2 M, what is the concentration after 6.0 minutes have passed? (5 points)Free Response Question 2: The rate constant of a given reaction is 3.2 s-1 at 400 K. If the activation energy of this reaction is 45.3 kJ/mol, what is the rate constant at 690 K? (5 points)Free Response Question 3: Using the method of initial rates, a student determines the rate law of a reaction to be Rate=k[A][B]. In a given trial of this reaction, 0.10 M A is combined with 0.30 M B. The measured initial rate of the reaction is 4.0 M/s. Use this information to determine the rate constant of the reaction, with units. (5 points)

In a qualitative study conducted on infidelity among couples, participating couples completed interviews. Transcripts were then reviewed and coded by two co-researchers. Through the coding of the data, the researchers identified three themes: Breach of trust,  Reduced sense of personal value, and Fear of future infidelity. To verify the themes, the co-researchers invited a colleague to evaluate the transcripts, during which he identified a fourth theme of "relationship resilience" that was described by the couples. This use of __________________________ strengthened the validity of the study.

En algunos lugares hay una escuela similar a la Junior High, pero esto no es comun en el mundo hispanico. Muchos estudiantes hispanicos estudian dos anos mas en una escuela preparatoria para entrar en la universidad. En los Estados Unidos, durante los dos anos de Junior College, hay enfasis en preparar a los estudiantes para un trabajo tecnico, no solo para entrar en la universidad. En los paises hispanicos las escuelas Junior High...

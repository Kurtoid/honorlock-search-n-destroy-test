Now suppose you decided to use your expertise to synthesize two different types of copolymers, still made out of the same MMA and VDF monomers as in the prior problem, but now comparing the free radical polymerization to a "living" anionic polymerization that enables you to synthesize a block copolymer.  Given that the properties weren't too good for your prior copolymer, you decided to compare these two reactions at an 70:30 composition of MMA:VDF.  The first analysis you did was run some DMTA curves to compare the properties of the block versus random copolymers.      - Which curve corresponds to the 70:30 copolymer of poly(methyl methacrylate-block-vinylidene fluoride)?  (red or blue)  [1] - Which curve corresponds to the 70:30 copolymer of poly(methyl methacrylate-statistical-vinylidene fluoride)?  (red or blue) [2] - Which copolymer would you expect to have the highest Young's modulus at room temperature? (red or blue) [3] - Which copolymer would you expect to have the best damping behavior at room temperature? (red or blue) [4] - Which of the following best describes the physical state of the red copolymer at room temperature?  Choose from A - E.  [5]               (A)  Viscous "melt" (sticky gooey)               (B)  Rubbery elastomer               (C)  Highly flexible and tough               (D)  Moderately rigid with some toughness               (E)  Glassy and brittle - Which of the following best describes the physical state of the blue copolymer at room temperature?  Choose from A - E.  [6]               (A)  Viscous "melt" (sticky gooey)               (B)  Rubbery elastomer               (C)  Highly flexible and tough               (D)  Moderately rigid with some toughness               (E)  Glassy and brittle

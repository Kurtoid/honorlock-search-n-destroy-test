A new Railroad Museum recently held its grand opening. The number of visitors in each of the 10 hours during the grand opening were recorded as:       34     51     72     38     43     69     37     68     53     55      Calculate the standard deviation for this population data set.
As shown in figure below, a reversible power cycle R and an irreversible power cycle I operate between the same hot and cold thermal reservoirs. Cycle I has a thermal efficiency equal to one-sixth of the thermal efficiency of cycle R eI=16eR.  If each cycle receives the same amount of energy by heat transfer from the hot reservoir, show (analytically) which cycle (R or I) develops greater net work.

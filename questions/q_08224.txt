Scenario 2 (continued): A species of tropical fish inhabits coral reefs.  Researchers wants to understand the selective pressure on body size for these fish.  They mark 300 fish of sizes ranging from 1 to 12 inches.  They released these fish into an enclosure with their main predator, their main food source, and plenty of hiding spots.  Two years later the researchers returned and measured the surviving fish.    Researchers suspect that it is not just body size that matters for survival, but also coloration (how brightly colored the fish is). They measure coloration and body size on another 300 fish and come back in another two years to document survival.  They find this adaptive landscape:     Given this adaptive landscape, how would you predict the population will change over time (assuming body size and coloration are heritable)?

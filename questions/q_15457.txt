FULL SOLUTION PROBLEM:  For the following question, write down the final answers here, but you must submit a full solution including Given, Find, EQU, all mathematical steps, and include units.  Work on this problem should be submitted to Test #3 Work Submission assignment no more than 15 minutes after the completion of this test. A 3.2-kg block slides down an inclined surface from point A to point B (see the figure below). Points A and B are 5.0 m apart. The coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.25 and the block is starting at rest from point A.   Draw a labeled free body diagram for the 3.2 kg mass [1pt]. Find the work done by the friction force on the block during its motion from point A to point B [1 pt.]. Find the work done by the gravitational force on the block during its motion from point A to point B [1 pt.]. Find the total work is done on the block (W_tot) during its motion from point A to point B. [1 pts.] Find the speed of the block when it reaches point B [1 pt.].

Egyptian Culture What is the political capital of the Egypt after the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt?
You have just left your customer's office. They were soft spoken and deliberate in their interaction with you. They informed you that they have been in their current job for 18 years. They asked you about problems that they might encounter and your ability to solve them. They mentioned that their boss depends upon them to thoroughly screen salespeople prior to letting the salespeople talk to anyone else in the firm. You noticed that they have a flip phone on their desk. What might you send them as a follow up?

Pick one of the following five prompts, clearly indicate which prompt was selected, and answer completely in the space provided below. 1) The Gene: An Intimate History argues that the three "R's" of gene physiology (regulation, replication, and recombination) are dependent on the molecular structure of DNA - specifically, on its base-pairing of the two complementary strands. Explain how regulation, replication, and recombination depend on this base-pairing principle/characteristic of DNA. 2) From The Gene: An Intimate History: "Gene, protein, function, and fate were strung in a chain: one chemical alteration in one base pair in DNA was sufficient to 'encode' a radical change in human fate." Give a specific example of this "chain" in humans, explaining the change in DNA, the following change in protein, the resulting change in function, and the corresponding "fate" of the human organism. (You may use the example from the book or choose your own example.) 3) Genetic diversity within a population's gene pool provides an evolutionary advantage. Sexual reproduction allows for increase in genetic variation because meiosis (the process of creating gametes for sexual reproduction) produces new combinations of alleles in two major ways. Define these two ways of generating genetic variation through meiosis, and explain how each can increase genetic diversity. 4) Explain how Francis Galton's strategy of eugenics paved the way for Nazi racial cleansing. Using what you read in The Gene: An Intimate History, define the term "eugenics" from Galton's perspective and describe at least two examples of eugenic practices encouraged or implemented in America. Then briefly explain how the Nazis twisted the language of heredity to justify their cause and how they incrementally expanded their eugenics program of sterilization, euthanasia, and outright murder to eventually include all lebensunwertes Leben - lives unworthy of living. 5) Based on what you read in The Gene: An Intimate History, explain why scientists originally expected proteins to be the molecules that carry genes rather than nucleic acids (the "stupid molecule"). Then, explain the significance of James Watson's revelation that "important biological objects come in pairs": to what "pairing" does this revelation refer; how did Watson come to this conclusion; and how did this realization, combined with Chargaff's rule, solve the previously frustrating mystery of the structure of DNA?

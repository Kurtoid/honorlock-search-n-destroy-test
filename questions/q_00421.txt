Question 2 A transportation student is driving on a rural road with a speed limit of 55mph for the mountainous segment and 60mph for the level segment. Use Practical Stopping Distance and assume common/typical values for some unknown variables such as ,  and  . (a) Assume the student is driving at the speed limit. If the stopping sight distance required to avoid colliding with a fallen boulder on a mountain pass is 530 feet, what is the likely grade of the mountainous segment of roadway? [v1] (to the nearest 0.001) Is it the uphill or downhill? [v2]   (b) The student claims that the level segment of this road can be safely negotiated at 70mph in rainy weather. Because of the winding nature of the road, one stretch of level pavement has a stopping sight distance of only 550 ft.  What would be the associated reaction time for the driving speed of 70mph as claimed by the student? [v3] sec (to the nearest 0.01)

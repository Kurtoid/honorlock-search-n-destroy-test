A preschool-age child is brought to clinic for evaluation of a rash. The Family Nurse Practitioner notes an intense red eruption on the child's cheeks and circumoral pallor. What will the nurse practitioner tell the parents about this rash?   Correct Answer: Expect a lacy, maculopapular rash to develop on the trunk and extremities. This "slapped cheek" rash is consistent with fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, and will be followed by a lacy, maculopapular all-over rash. It is not a prodrome of rubella or roseola, and immunizations are not indicated. Although it is mostly benign, there can be serious sequelae, especially for pregnant women.

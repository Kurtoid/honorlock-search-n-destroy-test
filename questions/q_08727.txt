A group of researchers is hired to sample local drinking water sources in a group of counties where local drinking water may have been contaminated, and comparing them to the local drinking water in a control area. The following table contains the summary statistics after a SRS was taken from each of the areas. Assuming that all of the necessary foundations for a two sample independent t test are met, carry out a test to determine if there is a significant difference in the lead levels in drinking water between the two groups at the alpha level of 0.05.  Use the conservative method for degrees of freedom, and do not assume equal variances.       Counties   Sample size   Average lead levels (ug/L, parts per billion)   Sample standard deviation     Control   16   0.4   0.06     Potentially Contaminated   13   9.8   1.2

Directions: Work all the problems below and upload your solutions, including your R code, in a single html file just like you have been doing in your homework. If you cannot generate the html file then do the best you can by uploading a single file that contains your work (Rmd file, text file, ... ). I cannot accept a late submission. The data sets needed are already available in R and don't need to be imported. Each of the problems below is worth 10 points. You may use your notes (written or stored on your computer) for this exam. Problem 1. The data set faithful provides measurements of the waiting time (waiting) and duration of the eruption (eruptions) for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park. a) Plot the variable waiting (measured in minutes) against the variable eruptions (measured in minutes). Also calculate the least squares regression line and include this line in your scatterplot. b) Interpret the slope. c) Use the prediction equation to predict the waiting time when the time of the last eruption is 3 minutes. d) Calculate the coefficient of determination for this regression and interpret it. Problem 2. The data set chickwts contains measurements made to compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens. Compare the distributions of the weights for the different feed types using density plots. Which feed type would you recommend? Explain. Problem 3. Visualize the relationship between the ambient carbon dioxide concentrations (conc) and carbon dioxide uptake rates (uptake) in the data set CO2 with a scatterplot where you color the printing character according to the levels of the factor Treatment. Problem 4. The function below generates a random number. Random.number

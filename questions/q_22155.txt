Consider the following problem where n is a positive integer. A rectangular 1 x n chocolate bar with n squares must be broken up into single squares. Show that, no matter where you make the breaks, this will require n  - 1 breaks. Ola wants to prove this by induction. Let P(n) be the statement that "for a 1 x n chocolate bar, you need n-1 breaks to break it into squares. After showing her base case, her inductive step starts with: Fix an integer k >= 1 and assume for all 1 <= j <= k, j - 1 breaks are required. What type of induction is she using?

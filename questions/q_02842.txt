A plaintiff opened a store on a property lot she owned in East Carolina. The plaintiff claims that the owner of the adjacent property had promised her that he would commercially develop his property next door if the plaintiff opened a store on her property; however, he never did develop it. The plaintiff's store failed. The plaintiff sues the adjacent property owner in diversity in East Carolina federal district court, asserting a claim of promissory estoppel. The parties disagree on whether or not the plaintiff must prove, as an element of her promissory estoppel claim, that the defendant's promise to her was sufficiently definite to constitute a binding offer (the "definiteness requirement").East Carolina courts hold that claims based on a promise (like the plaintiff's) are governed by the law of the state where the promise was supposed to be performed.In 1991 the East Carolina Supreme Court held that the definiteness requirement is an element of a claim for promissory estoppel. However, more recently, courts in several other states that formerly imposed a definiteness requirement have abolished it. How should the federal district court proceed?

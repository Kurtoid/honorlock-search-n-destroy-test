To obtain the 5 bonus points associated with this sample exam, you need to carefully read the following statements, and then select "I have read, understand and agree with the statements above". I have completed this sample exam 1 and ensured that my computer system, webcam, and microphone are sufficient to allow me to take my Accounting Analytics exams on Canvas using HonorLock. Especially, I confirmed that I can actually use Excel. I understand that while taking exams on Canvas through HonorLock:  I must be in a dedicated area working at a table or desk. I cannot take my exam sitting on a couch or in bed. I must show all of the following at the beginning of my exam session: my face, my picture ID, a COMPLETE 360 degree room scan that includes my work space and the wall behind my computer. Items not allowed during exam: phone, smart watch, hat, and sunglasses. I am not allowed to leave the room once I begin the exam. Also, no one is allowed to enter the room. Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid exam and a grade of zero. It may also result in a case of academic dishonesty. To make the process smoother, I will keep my hands off my face. The program will freeze and pause the exam whenever my face is not clearly visible. That has the potential to greatly disrupt my exam time.

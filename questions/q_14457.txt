35) Tyson is a psychologist.  He randomly recruits a sample of 1000 participants.    He first asks the participants to write down 10 words that start with the letter 'T' and measures how long it takes them.  On average it takes the participants 15 seconds to complete the list (*note: this suggests it's quite easy for participants to think of words that start with the letter 'T').    He then asks the participants to write down 10 words that have the letter 'T' as the fifth letter in the word and again measures how long it takes them. On average it takes the participants 2 minutes and 15 seconds to complete the list (*note: this suggests that it's pretty difficult for participants to think of words that have 'T' as the fifth letter).  Finally, he asks the participants whether they think there are more total words that start with the letter 'T' or that have 'T' as the fifth letter.  Almost 90% of participants say that there are more words that start with the letter 'T,' even though the actual answer is that there are more words that have 'T' as the fifth letter.  Tyson's results are most consistent with what known error of decision-making?

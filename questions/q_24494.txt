Use the following information for questions 33 through 36.   The Western Division of Sportswear Company makes socks and sells them in its region for $6 per unit. (A unit is a pair of socks.) Socks have per-unit manufacturing costs of $2.50 variable plus $1.50 fixed. The Eastern Division of Sportswear Co. is experiencing new demand in its markets (where prices are somewhat lower). It cannot meet this demand from its own production facilities and would like to buy 15,000 pairs of socks from Western, paying Western its full production cost of $4.00 as a transfer price. Eastern will then sell the socks to its customers at a price of $5.75, and will incur $0.75 per unit of variable selling costs. The Eastern Division has no other source for these socks. The Western Division has excess capacity (even at normal volume) and it can produce the 15,000 units without interfering with its current outside sales of 70,000 or requiring additional fixed resources. Both divisions are profit centers and are free to trade with each other or not, as they choose.

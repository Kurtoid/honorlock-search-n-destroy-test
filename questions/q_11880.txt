Changing Velocity with Position One advantage to using the velocity blocks inside conditionals (if blocks) is that your sprite keeps moving, even after the condition stops being true. For example, you only had to press a key once to launch your fly bot, and it kept flying forever. The code below uses if statements to make a fish sprite move in different directions.  var fish = createSprite(200, 200);fish.setAnimation("fishR");fish.velocityX = 2; function draw() {background("blue"); // if fish reaches left edge, fish moves right.if (fish.x < 0) {fish.setAnimation("fishR");fish.velocityX = 2;}// if fish reaches right edge, fish swims left.if (fish.x > 400) {fish.setAnimation("fishL");fish.velocityX = -2;}drawSprites();}  Do This  Look at if statements that check the sprite's position and set its velocity. Write what you think the code will do

1) Your research project involves a set of three Arabidopsis genes, which TAIR lists as of    'unknown function'. Two of these (ABC1 and ABC2) are 90% identical at the protein level, while the third (ABC3) is 40% identical to the other two at the DNA level and has 65% protein identity and 86% similarity. You obtain homozygous t-DNA knockout single mutants for abc1 and abc2, and they look the same as wild-type under all conditions that you grow the plants. Suggest a hypothesis for the lack of a mutant phenotype. (5 points) 2) Given the response to the last question, you decide to try other approaches to finding a whole plant phenotype associated with altered expression of each member of this gene family. What functional genomic approaches that do not involve t-DNA or transposon mutants would you choose? Indicate whether the approach allows you to distinguish a specific function for each gene (5 points) 3) Based on what can you hypothesize to which cell organelle ABC1, 2 and 3 proteins are targeted? Describe how you could test your hypothesis? Describe the anticipated results if your hypothesis is correct (5 points) 4) The centromere of eukaryotic chromosomes is essential for the faithful segregation and inheritance of genetic information. It contains highly repetitive DNA. They identified a repetitive sequence called pAL1 satellite repeat in Arabidopsis genome. Describe a cytological method to understand the distribution and copy number variation of the pAL1 satellite repeat in Arabidopsis centromeres (5 points)

Your car loan requires payments of $250 per month for the first year and $450 per month during the second year. The APR is 6%, with monthly compounding, and payments begin one month after the car is purchased. You begin to calculate the present value of the loan by entering the following in your financial calculator: 0 FV -450 PMT 12 N .5 I/Y CPT PV. Your financial calculator then gives you the value of 5228.52. Which of the following can you then enter in your financial calculator to find the initial amount of the loan?

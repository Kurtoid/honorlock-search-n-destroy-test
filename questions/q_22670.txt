A design engineer wants to construct a sample mean chart for controlling the service life of a halogen headlamp his company produces. He knows from numerous previous samples that this service life is normally distributed with a mean of 500 hours and a standard deviation of 20 hours. On three recent production batches, he tested service life on random samples of four headlamps, with these results:    Sample Service Life (hours)   1 495 500 505 500   2 525 515 505 515   3 470 480 460 470    What is the sample mean service life for sample 2?

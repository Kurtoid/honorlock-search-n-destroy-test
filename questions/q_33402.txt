In the figure, a laser positioned on a ship is used to communicate with a small two-man research submarine resting on the bottom of a lake. The laser is positioned 12 m above the surface of the water, and it strikes the water 20 m from the side of the ship. The water is 76 m deep and has an index of refraction of 1.33. How far horizontally is the submarine from the side of the ship?

Part 2. The following 13 short essay questions are designed to evaluate critical thinking/reasoning skills, please make sure that you provide the most detailed answer you can.  You do not need to answer all of the questions.  What you need to do is choose 2 the following questions to answer on the attached sheets of paper (correctly number which questions you chose). If you answer more than two questions, only the first two will be graded. (5 pts. each) 1) Describe Bowen's Reaction Series in detail and explain why geologists are able to use it to predict what minerals will develop from a cooling magma. 2) In your own words, explain why most plutons are more often felsic (granite) or andesitic (diorite) than basaltic (gabbro).  Keep in mind the various ways magma can change and the fact that older continental crust is felsic to begin with. 3) Explain why magmas that are generated from partial melting (at convergent boundaries) are more felsic (have more Si+O) than magmas generated from decompression melting (at divergent boundaries). 4) What makes composite (stratovolcano) volcanoes have such violent eruptions? 5) "Draw" (or keyboard type) a generalized soil profile, label it, and discuss what processes are occurring at the different horizons. 6) Discuss how aspects of mechanical weathering can help accelerate chemical weathering. 7) Define what a transgression and a regression are and discuss one way that a transgression or regression could occur. 8) Define what a sedimentary facies is and explain why understanding facies can have impacts on exploring for economic resources. 9) Pick two of the major types of metamorphism and explain what is unique about those types. 10) William "Strata" Smith developed the principle of faunal succession. What does this principle state and how can it be used to correlate different stratigraphic areas? 11) What is a fossil? What are two modes of fossilization and how do those modes of fossilization occur (i.e., what happens during the fossilization process)? 12) Discuss the differences in alpha decay, beta decay, and electron capture and how those decay methods relate to radiometric dating? 13) Pick two other modes of absolute dating and discuss how those processes differ from radioisotopic (radiometric) dating.

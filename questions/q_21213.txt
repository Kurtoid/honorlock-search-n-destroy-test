3. Assume that South Africa has instituted a special trade program with Germany, the UK, and France (all WTO members) concerning the sale of fiber optic wire used for high-speed telecommunications and internet transmissions. Fiber optic wire imported into South Africa from all countries is subject to the same tariffs and duties under the rates required by South Africa's GATT commitments. However, once all customs duties are paid, fiber optic wire from only these three countries are entitled to a rebate of 50 percent on all sales and excise taxes paid when sold to various local internet and technology companies for installation. The United States argues that this tax rebate law is a violation of the MFN principle. South Africa replies that the MFN principle deals with differential treatment in the imposition of tariffs at the border and that this program, imposing sales and excise taxes after the goods have cleared customs, has nothing to do with border measures.

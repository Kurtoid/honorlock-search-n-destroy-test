UMBUZO 3.2 Fundisisa isiqeshana esingezansi bese uphendula imibuzo elandelayo. Kunomkhuba omubi owande emhlabeni wonke. Kukhona abantu abantshontsha izingane. Bazintshontsha ezibhedlela, ezikoleni nasezindaweni eziphithizelayo njengase-Mall, emini kabha. Ziningi izizathu zokuntshontshwa kwezingane. Abanye basuke bezozidayisela labo abangatholi abantwana. Abanye bazidayisele abakwamanye amazwe abenza ibhizinisi lokuzisebenzisa njengezigqila zocansi. Izinyanga nazo ziyazithenga ngoba zifuna ukuthatha ezinye izitho zomzimba khona zizokwenza imithi. Bathi imithi isebenza kahle uma kutholakale usana ngoba alunaso isono. Laba bantu izigilamkhuba zoqobo. Amaphoyisa angazibopha uma engasebenza kanzima. Ubuntu buphelile ngoba abubuyiseli. Kumele kuhlonishwe ilungelo lomuntu lokuphila. Ingane iyisibusiso esivela kuMdali. Amazwi eBhayibheli athi; 'Ungabulali, ungebi.' UHulumeni yena uthi; 'Ngizomfaka ejele ozotholakala entshontsha ingane.'

Question 9: Viruses as Therapeutics (Dr. A. Disculescu)    List two Pros- and two Cons- of using adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) as gene therapy tools compared to adenovirus or lentivirus. Briefly explain the advantages and disadvantages in each case. (4 points)        2. Hereditary blindness can be caused by genetic defects in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, where a continuous supply of 11-cis-retinal chromophore is produced from vitamin A. One of the key components of the visual cycle is the RPE65 protein, an isomerohydrolase that converts all-trans retinyl ester to 11-cis retinol in RPE. In 2017, LUXTURNA(tm) (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) from Spark Therapeutics, became the first United States FDA-approved gene therapy product for the eye for the treatment of LCA2 disease, specifically by providing a functional RPE65 gene using an AAV2-CBA-human RPE65 serotype. Provide 2 reasons why the AAV-based RPE65 gene therapy for this disease was relatively easier to develop compared to other inherited disorders. (4 points)       3. Compared to human patients, AAV-viral vector mediated therapy in mouse models of RPE65 deficiency results in robust restoration in retinal function, as determined by electroretinography (ERG) analysis, and preservation of light-sensitive photoreceptor neurons. Select one potential reason for this remarkable success in animal models, from the 2 choices below: (2 points)                 a. Optimum window of treatment: The AAV-mediated gene therapy in animal models was initiated either before the disease onset, or at early stages of retinal degeneration, when the majority of the photoreceptor neurons were still present.               b. AAV viral capsid: A self-complementary AAV vector was used in animal models of RPE65 deficiency, ensuring a faster onset of transgene expression
Ordinary repairs are expenditures that do not get added to the balance of the asset to which they relate and instead get written off in the year in which they occur.

Is the bolded statement TRUE or FALSE? Two biomolecules are known to interact with one another in order to facilitate a biological process.  One of these molecules is a protein the other is a small molecule found in the cell.  Given this classify the following statements as true or false.   56. If mutation of a glutamate to a leucine in the protein negatively impacts the binding, it is reasonable to say that ionic bonding facilitates binding between the two biomolecules. 57. Formation of hydrogen bonds between the two biomolecules is enthalpically favorable and will contribute to the strength of interaction between the two. 58. Hydrophobic interactions are incapable of stabilizing (making favorable) the interactions between the two biomolecules. 59. An ionic bond between the two biomolecules would be stronger if it formed in a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the protein relative to a hydrophilic pocket. 60. Free energy will remain unchanged when comparing a state in which the biomolecules are not interacting and a state when they have formed the interaction.

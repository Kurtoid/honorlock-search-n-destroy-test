Suppose there are two types of dentists:  good and bad.  Good dentists went to accredited dental schools, generally know what they're doing, and provide good dental care.  Bad dentists are fakes.  They never went to dental school, so they provide shoddy treatment.  In fact, most patients actually develop cavities about a month after a visit to a bad dentist. Suppose that a good dentist cannot charge less than $100 per visit without losing money.  On the other hand, a bad dentist could charge $50 per visit without losing money.  The problem is that it's impossible for patients to tell good from bad dentists before they visit.  However, due to news reports, consumers think that about 60% of all dentists are "bad" dentists.  A consumer is willing to pay a good dentist  $150 per visit, and is willing to pay $0 to visit a bad dentist.  What is the most likely percentage of patients that good dentists will treat?

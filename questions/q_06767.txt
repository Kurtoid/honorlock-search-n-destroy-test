Remember all the way back at the start of this exam -- the sailfin molly scenario?  There is an error in that scenario.  An error that was paced there deliberately.   So...can you find the error?   If you attempt to identify the error and fail, you will have 3-points subtracted from your exam grade. If you attempt to identify the error successfully, you will have 5-points added to your exam grade.  If you leave this question blank, your grade will be unchanged.   The choice is yours...   Here is the passage again, error included.   The sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna) is an important species of Everglades fish. Mollies are euryhaline, meaning they can move freely throughout life between saltwater and freshwater (which allows them to dwell in all parts of the Everglades). The diet of mollies is mainly algae though they will also consume small invertebrates, including insect larvae like those of mosquitoes. In the Everglades food web, mollies are a primary consumer and are eaten by many other animals including alligators (reptiles), snowy egrets (birds), raccoons (mammals), giant water bugs (insects), and bullfrogs (amphibians).

Q#49 A common pattern of social grouping found in Old World monkeys is the female-bonded group in which females are born, live their entire lives and die in the same group. All members of this group are in contact with each other every day. In contrast, the common chimpanzees studied by Jane Goodall live in bi-level fission-fusion social groups of related males (with females who emigrated into the group during adolescence).

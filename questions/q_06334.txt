4. The headline in the Sacramento Bee newspaper read, "Women appear to be better investors than men in study" (Jack Sirard, April 24, 2005, p. D1).  The conclusion was based on a telephone poll of 500 randomly selected men and 500 randomly selected women.  One quote in the article was that "men are much more likely to stick with a losing investment than women are (45% vs 37%).  Of the 500 male investors, 225 decided to stick with a losing investment.  Of the 500 female investors, 185 decided to stick with a losing investment.  The following table displays the data for these two groups.    Group n  Number who stick with a losing investment    Male Investors 500 225   Female Investors 500 185    Test the research hypothesis that the population proportion of male investors who decided to stick with a losing investment is more than that of female investors who decided to stick with a losing investment.

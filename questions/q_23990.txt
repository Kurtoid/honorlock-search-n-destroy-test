Explain in detail what is a gravimetric analysis? b. Make use of the attached image to present a general description of the gravimetric analysis and to explain the calculation process followed to find out the cation identity in the unknown sample. c.

The period of a pendulum is given as
When a solution containing 8.00 g of NaOH in 50.0 mL of solution at 25.0 degC is added to a solution of 8.00 g of HCl (excess) in 250.0 mL of solution at 25.0 degC in a calorimeter, the temperature of the solution increases to 33.5 degC. Assuming that the specific heat of the solution is that of pure water, and the density of the solutions is 1.000 g/mL, calculate the [?]Hrxn in kilojoules per mole of NaOH for the reaction. NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) - NaCl(aq)  + H2O(l)
A noninflammatory degeneration of the nerves supplying the muscles of the extremities is known as:
Functional groups are groups of atoms within molecules that give diverse properties to the molecules they are found on.  For example, the male and female steroid hormones (testosterone and estradiol) determine the differences between the male and female sexes in all vertebrates and are a result of a single functional group change between the two molecules.  Below are 5 molecules that contain some of functional groups most essential to life.  Use these molecules to answer the next several questions.    40. Many neurotransmitters, such as histamine that is involved in the allergy response, are derived from amino acids such as histidine that contain this "basic amino functional group".

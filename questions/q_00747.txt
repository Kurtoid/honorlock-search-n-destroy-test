Draw a double reciprocal plot for an enzyme in the presence and absence of the following inhibitors. Indicate what happens to the Km and Vmax (i.e. increases, decreases, or remains the same) [Tip: Make sure to properly label the plot lines and axes. It might be better to use different colors to indicate the presence and absence of an enzyme.]     In the presence of a competitive inhibitor:   Lineweaver Burk double reciprocal plot, +/- competitive inhibitor           Km=       Vmax=                  In the presence of a non-competitive inhibitor:   Lineweaver Burk double reciprocal plot, +/- non-competitive inhibitor         Km=       Vmax=                 In the presence of an uncompetitive inhibitor:   Lineweaver Burk double reciprocal plot, +/- uncompetitive inhibitor           Km=       Vmax=

The physical fitness of a patient is often measured by the patient's maximum oxygen uptake (which is recorded in milliliters per kilogram, ml/kg). The mean maximum oxygen uptake for cardiac patients who regularly participate in sports was found to be 24.1 ml/kg, with a standard deviation of 6.3 ml/kg. Assume that this distribution is approximately normal. For each part, provide a shaded sketch that is labeled appropriately as part of your answer. Answers without appropriate support will not receive credit. Use correct notation and rounding.  Find the probability that a cardiac patient who regularly participates in sports has a maximum oxygen uptake of less than 34 ml/kg. [blank1] Find the probability that a cardiac patient who regularly participates in sports has a maximum oxygen uptake of greater than 18 ml/kg. [blank2] Find the probability that a cardiac patient who regularly participates in sports has a maximum oxygen uptake between 22 ml/kg and 32 ml/kg. [blank3]

You have a chance to buy an annuity that pays $[pmt] at the beginning of each year for [n] years. You could earn [r]% on your money in other investments with equal risk. What is the most you should pay for the annuity? (Hint: "the most you should pay" .... basically = "what is the price?" ..... You would agree to pay a lower price than the fundamental (true) price. You would not, however, agree to pay any price above the true price, right?) **Round your answer to the nearest three decimals if needed. Do not type the $ symbol.

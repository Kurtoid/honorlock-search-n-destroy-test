The following scenario displays which approach that we can use to facilitate positive interactions between diverse participants within leisure contexts: Jennifer, a leisure service manager, understands that recreation activities can be used to teach participants from a Western society about beliefs and philosophies associated with Eastern cultures. She offers activities at the recreation center including dances such as Middle Eastern folk dancing and belly dancing, martial arts including tae kwon do and karate, and fitness activities such as yoga and Pilates.

In class we covered a reaction called the "pinacol rearrangement" which dehydrates 1,2-diols to yield aldehydes/ketones via carbocation intermediates. An example of a pinacol rearrangement is shown below.  The following deamination (elimination of NH3) of a b-aminoalcohol proceeds through a mechanism similar to that of a pinacol rearrangement. Note the curved arrow indicating that nitrogen gas (:N[?]N:, N2) will depart as a leaving group in the next mechanistic step.  Which of the following species (A-D) is a mechanistic intermediate in this deamination reaction? [intermediate]  Which of the following molecules (E-H) would be the expected major product of this deamination reaction? [product]  Two (2) of the following b-aminoalcohols (I-L) could give the same product as the pinacol rearrangement shown at the very top of this page (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) in the deamination reaction. Answer the following questions about these b-aminoalcohols. Note that ring contraction rearrangements may occur to reduce ring strain. Could b-aminoalcohol I give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon treatment with NaNO2 / HCl? [betaI] Could b-aminoalcohol L give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon treatment with NaNO2 / HCl? [betaL]

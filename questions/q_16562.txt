A process characteristic follows a normal distribution with a mean of 25.15 and standard deviation of 0.9.  The spec limits for the characteristic are 25.00 +/- 1.5.   If a sample of 6 parts are taken from the process, what is the probability that there will be no parts out of spec in the sample?

FULL SOLUTION PROBLEM:  For the following question, write down the final answers here, but you must submit a full solution including Given, Find, EQU, all mathematical steps, and include units.  Work on this problem should be submitted to Test #3 Work Submission assignment no more than 15 minutes after the completion of this test. A child of mass m=40 kg starts from rest and slides without friction from a height h= 8 m along with a slide next to a pool (see the figure below). She is launched from a height h/4 and at an angle th = 25deg above the horizontal into the air over the pool. Define the configuration when the child is at the water level as having zero gravitational potential energy.   Make a table of knowns and unknowns [1 pt.]. Find the potential energy change of the child when she moves from the top of the slide to the launching point [1 pt.]. Determine her launching speed at the end of the slide [2 pts.]. Determine her maximum range in the horizontal direction (x_max) [1 pt.].

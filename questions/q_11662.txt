A thin rod, m1 = 20 kg, length = 3.0 m, lays on a frictionless horizontal table.  On the left end, it is attached to a vertical axis about which it can rotate freely.  A point mass, m2 = 5.0 kg is attached at 2.0 m from the axis.  Horizontal force F = 160 N is applied at the end of the rod at an angle of 130deg as shown. a) Find the total moment of inertia of the rod + point mass system. b)  Find the angular acceleration of the system about the axis on the left side of the rod. c)  If the system starts from rest, how fast is it moving after 5.0 s have passed?

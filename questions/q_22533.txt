At a certain manufacturing plant, 1% of all parts made have a defect that makes them unsuitable for shipping. Prior to shipping any parts, the manufacturer performs quality assurance checks on all parts using Automatic Testing Equipment (ATE). If the ATE identifies a part as defective, the part is scrapped. The ATE has been calibrated to accurately detect 97% of all defective parts. Unfortunately, the ATE has a 2% false detection rate. That is, it will identify 2% of non-defective parts as defective.

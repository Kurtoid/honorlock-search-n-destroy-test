Simon is an avid gardener who spends a lot of time caring for the plants in his garden. To minimize damage from pests from his garden, Simon uses a pesticide spray. After a few years of using the same pesticide spray, he notices that it has become less effective. This is most likely due to

Extra credit question (2 points; it shows as 0 points in this exam so that Canvas will not count it in the denominator, I will manually add up to 2 points as appropriate when grading so that it will show as extra credit). As we have covered earlier in the quarter, the influenza vaccine and many others you may have gotten typically consist of either proteins representing the pathogen, or an inactivated ("killed") or otherwise "attenuated" (harmless) version of the pathogen.  In response to the vaccine, B lymphocytes of your body produce antibodies that bind specifically to the protein or pathogen. This effectively "trains" your immune system to be able to rapidly and powerfully respond if you are exposed to the actual pathogen, thereby protecting you. A number of the new vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that is causing the global pandemic are instead RNA vaccines, meaning they consist of RNA sequences of genes from the coronavirus. For example, the one developed by Moderna is the RNA that codes for the viral spike protein, a protein on the surface involved in attachment and uptake by the cell. If classical vaccines rely on the injection of a protein in order for the immune system to respond to produce antibodies that bind that protein, what do you think the mechanism is of this RNA vaccine? In other words, how do you think this RNA vaccine elicits a proper immune response yielding antibody production that will bind and block the coronavirus, as clinical trials thus far have demonstrated it does? What do you think the antibodies bind to on the virus? Please explain briefly but clearly.
A 39-year-old man has had headache, weakness, a 5-kg weight gain, and mental depression over the past 3 months. On exam, his face is puffy. Temperature is 36.9degC, Blood pressure is 160/75 mm Hg. He has cutaneous striae over the lower abdomen and ecchymoses scattered over the extremities. An x-ray of the spine shows a compressed fracture of T11. Labs reveal a fasting plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL, serum Na+ of 150 mmol/L (RR: 136-146 mmol/L) , serum K+ of 3.1 mmol/L (RR 3.5-4.5 mmol/L); plasma cortisol is 38 mg/dL at 8:00 am (RR: 10 to 20 mg/dL) and 37 mg/dL at 6:00 pm (RR: 3 to 10 mg/dL). Administration of low and high doses of dexamethasone fails to suppress the plasma cortisol level and excretion of urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. The plasma corticotropin (ACTH) level at 8:00 AM is 0.8 pg/mL (RR: 10 and 60 pg/mL)  Which of the following lesions is most likely to be present in this man?

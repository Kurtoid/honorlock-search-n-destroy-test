According to Harley-Davidson (H-D) management, the company does not sell motorcycles or riding gear. Instead, according to H-D's mission statement, the company is in the business of "fulfilling dreams." Over the years, H-D has developed a business culture that it describes as "Harleyness." Prospective employees are screened to determine if they have the cultural fit. The company encourages employees to own and use the same types of motorcycles used by customers. Harley people ride their bikes to work and spend vacations touring and attending rallies with fellow Harley riders. Maintaining a strong relationship with customers is engrained in H-D culture. When a person buys a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, he or she receives a free 1year membership to the Harley Owners Group (HOG), which was developed in 1983 as a program to keep people active with their Harley. Simultaneously, it keeps the company close to its customer. Through HOG, the company supports rallies, club meetings, and weekend parties featuring free food and drink. H-D executives routinely attend bike rallies across the country to stay in touch with Harley-Davidson customers and enthusiasts. H-D employees want to hear first-hand from fellow riders about great riding experiences--or problems--they might have had. And they're able to tell those riders, "I know what you mean." Because those employees are riders too. Customer-oriented personnel who ride the products they make and sell, sponsorship of motorcycle clubs and parties, and employee attendance at bike rallies all work together at Harley-Davidson to implement which type of strategy?

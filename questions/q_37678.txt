A 27-year-old phenotypic female presented to the outpatient department of the OB-GYN unit and then was referred to the genetics clinic for cytogenetic investigation due to primary amenorrhea. The pedigree of the proband (III-10) is shown in the figure. She was 5'9'' tall and weighed 190 lb.

Ultrasonography of the proband showed a blind vagina with absence of ovaries. Hormonal profile showed normal serum FSH, slightly elevated serum LH, and testosterone levels in the normal male range. Genetic testing revealed that her karyotype was 46,XY and FISH analysis confirmed the presence of the SRY gene.

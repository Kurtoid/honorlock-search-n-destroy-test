A 3-year-old child is brought to the clinic by a parent who reports that the child refuses to use the right arm after being swung by both arms while playing. The child is sitting with the right arm held slightly flexed and close to the body. There is no swelling or ecchymosis present. What will the nurse practitioner do? Correct Answer: Gently attempt a supination and flexion technique. This is most likely an annular ligament displacement injury, or "nursemaid's elbow." The primary provider can attempt to reduce the elbow using either a supination/flexion technique or a pronation technique. Consider maltreatment if recurrent dislocations or other symptoms or signs are present. If this fails after three attempts, immobilization and referral are indicated. Radiologic studies are rarely necessary.

A six-lane freeway (three lanes in each direction) is in rolling terrain. On this segment of freeway, the directional peak-hour volume is 3800 vehicles with 4% large trucks and 5% buses (no RVs), the peak-hour factor is 0.80, and all drivers are regular users. The lanes are 12 ft wide, there are no lateral obstructions within 6 ft of the roadway, and the ramp density is 2.0 per mile. Due to funding shortage, bus routes on this freeway will be eliminated, but it is estimated that for each bus removed from the roadway, eight additional passenger cars will be added as travelers seek other means of travel. What is the additional number of lanes that need to be added in order to maintain LOS C or better?

Approaching Multiplication Creatively Let's apply all three methods explained in this module so far to a single problem, 73 x 49. We'll begin by using the addition method:                               73 ([70] + 3)                           x 49 70 x 49 = [3430]   3 x 49 = + [147]                        [3577] Now try the subtraction method:                                 73                              x 49 ( 50 - 1 )   50 x 73 = [3650]  - 1 x 73 = -     [73]                         [3577b] * To do the subtraction, 3650 - 73, you can subtract 100, then add back the complement of 73.  The complement of 73 is [27].  Finally, try the factoring method: 73 x 49 = 73 x 7 x 7 = [511] x 7 = [3577c] Congratulations! You are on your way to mastering 2-by-2 multiplication and now have all the basic skills you need to be a fast mental calculator.  All you need to become a lightning calculator is more practice!

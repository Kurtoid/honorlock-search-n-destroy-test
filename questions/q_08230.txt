The inefficiency of a cartel market structure is based on all but which one of the following issues?
Problem Statement A digitally automated conveyor belt has been designed to count the number of items placed into a box. The conveyor belt has a sensor to count the number of items, and an error detection circuit displays a light if the number of items in the box is incorrect (due to manufacturing requirements).  Show the design of this error detection circuit with the following specifications:    The input to the error detection circuit is a 4-bit number, DCBA, representing the number of items in the box. The output of the error detection circuit provides a HIGH when the number of items is greater than 4, or less than 14. There will never be more than 13 items placed into the box, so the output of the error detection circuit does not matter when the sensor reaches a count larger than 13.     Requirements   Design a truth table to describe the output of the circuit. Using a K-map, write the simplified expression for the output.   In the answer box below, create your truth table.    Next, create your digital k-map in the answer box, below your truth table. On your scratch paper, make your circles and determine your output expression.  Below your digital k-map, type the output expression for the circuit.     Build the circuit in Multisim.  Use switches for each input D, C, B, A.  Connect the output of your circuit to an LED (probe).  Ensure that the circuit works correctly.  Submission Your submission should include: 1.)  All of the work that you used to design the circuit.  This should include your digitally created truth table, k-map/Boolean algebra, and simplified expression for the output.  2.) a Multisim file that contains your circuit.  This should NOT be a PDF, screenshot, JPEG, Word document, etc.  Submit your actual Multisim (.ms14) file once complete. When you are ready, click "Next".  You will be asked to submit your Multisim file.

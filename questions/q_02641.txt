Recall that, for positive integer m and non-negative integer a, the remainder of a when divided by m is the unique integer r where 0 <= r < m and a=qm+r for some q [?] N. Consider the following algorithm for finding the remainder when a is divided by m. rem(a,m), where a [?] N and m [?] N+ if a < m return a else return rem(a-m,m){output is the remainder of a when divided by m} Which of the following steps are part of showing that rem terminates using strong induction on n and the predicate P(n), which is the statement "rem(n,m) terminates"? Select all that apply. (Note that m remains fixed throughout.)

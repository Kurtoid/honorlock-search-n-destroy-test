Which of the following is a valid combination of quantum numbers?
Lactose intolerance results when a person inherits two defective alleles for the lactase gene. Normally, this gene produces the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose during digestion. What would most likely happen if a person had one defective allele and the other allele was functional?
--Pulisco gli spinaci? --Si`, _____ gli spinaci. [verb]

Lucy Chang recently purchased a lovely ceramic bowl that featured a red dragon design. When she thought about her purchase, she found that she really had no justification for buying the bowl other than it reminded her of the bowls her mother used during evening meals when she was a young child in Hong Kong. Which type of relationship with a product best explains the reason for Lucy's purchase of the dragon bowl?

True/False.  Enter T or F for statement.  (Do not enter the words "true" or "false".  Just the capital letter T or F) [1] Digital logic is implemented with passive, linear devices. [2] Semiconductors are useful in part due to their ability to quickly change conductivity by orders of magnitude. [3] At room temperature, Si and Ge have the same bandgap. [4] At room temperature, Si and Ge have the same intrinsic carrier concentration. [5] For Si at room temperature, the number of intrinsic carriers is relatively small compared to the total number of Si atoms. [6] For a P|N junction in equilibrium, the diffusion current balances out the drift current. [7] A p-channel MOSFET requires VGS to be negative in order to turn the transistor on. [8] A major benefit of CMOS logic is that it affords zero static power consumption. [9] Thinking about Project 4 - Diodes, the red LED showed the smallest forward-bias turn-on (threshold) voltage. [10] Thinking about Project 5 - Diode Applications, the infrared receiver circuit created a sine wave where the frequency correlated with the button pushed on the infrared remote control.

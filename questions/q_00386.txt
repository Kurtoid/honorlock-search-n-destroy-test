Your marketing consultant firm conducted a study to compare the recall of brands advertised during 3 different types of TV programs: violent, sexual, and neutral. The summary statistics are shown in the table below:         Violent   Sexual   Neutral     Mean   2.08   1.71   3.17     SD   1.87   1.76   1.77     N   108   108   108     You determine a 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean number of brands recalled while watching Violent and Neutral shows (uviolent-uneutral) to be (-1.578, -0.602). Based on this interval is there evidence of a significant difference in the mean number of brands recalled? During which type of TV show would you recommend that a company advertise their product

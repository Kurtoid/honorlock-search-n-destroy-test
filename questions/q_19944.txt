[20pts]  A single part is made by two different sequential processes: shearing and bending. The demand for this part is 100,000 units per week.  The company operates 6 days per week, 8 hours per day, one shift per day. Each process has parts that are defective but can be reworked. Given the following performance data, find the number of each machine needed to meet the demand. Notice the time units are in seconds!    (a) [10pts] What are the input of parts to each process required to meet demand?             (b) [10pts] How many bending and shearing machines are necessary to meet demand?

When cockroaches are attacked by a toad, they turn and run away.  A roach has wind sensors that react to puffs of air pushed ahead of approaching predators.

Use what you know about moth orientation to bat cries to suggest how this simple system might provide the information the roach needs to turn and run away from the toad, rather than toward it.

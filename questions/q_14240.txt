Regression is often used in health research to help determine the social and economic indicators that lead to certain health problems.  You wish to understand some of the factors that lead to Cirrhosis of the liver.  You have a dataset, where each item is a US state.  The variables are as follows: Independent Variables SizeUrban: the size of the urban population, Birth45to49: the number of births to women between 45 to 49 (actually, the reciprocal of that value, times 100) ConsWine: the consumption of wine per capita, ConsLiquor: the consumption of hard liquor per capita, Dependent Variable Cirrhosis: the death rate from cirrhosis. You run the regression and get the following results: > lm.Cirr summary(lm.Cirr)  a) What proportion of variation in the data is accounted for by the regression? Will the regression model give good predictive power? Why? b) In the health field, it is always good to be sure of good statistical significance, so you choose a Type I error of a=0.01. At this level of error, is the overall regression significant? Why (give evidence using p-value)?  Which independent variables are significant at a=0.01? c) The model is built using data from 46 states. A few states were missed out, including Mississippi. Mississippi has the following data.     SizeUrban   Birth45to49   ConsWine   ConsLiquor      31   34.2   6   35      Use this data and the coefficient output from the regression model to predict the value of cirrhosis for Mississippi. (just a point estimate of

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION APPLIES TO QUESTIONS 4 AND 5. The Morton Company processes unprocessed goat milk up to the splitoff point where two products, condensed goat milk and skim goat milk result. The following information was collected for the month of October:     Direct materials processed:     Production:     Sales:   50,000 gallons (shrinkage was 10%)   Condensed goat milk           20,000 gallons Skim goat milk                      25,000 gallons   Condensed goat milk           $3.00 per gallon Skim goat milk                      $2.00 per gallon       The costs of purchasing the 50,000 gallons of unprocessed goat milk and processing it up to the splitoff point to yield a total of 45,000 gallons of saleable product was $75,000.  There were no beginning or ending inventory balances of either product. Condensed goat milk may be processed further to yield 18,000 gallons (the remainder is shrinkage) of a medicinal milk product, Xyla, for an additional processing cost of $5 per useable gallon.  Xyla can be sold for $20 per gallon. Skim goat milk can be processed further to yield 24,000 gallons of skim goat milk ice cream, for an additional processing cost of $2.50 per useable gallon.  The product can be sold for $10 per gallon. What is the estimated net realizable value of Xyla at the splitoff point?

Read this letter to the editor.  Then, answer the questions.   Dear Editor:   (1)  I read your May 10th column about electronic books, or e-books, with great interest. You made several good points about the disadvantages of e-books. You may have overlooked, however, some of the ways in which they are superior to traditional books. Yes, e-books are expensive, but they are also convenient and efficient. Furthermore, due to their environment-friendly nature, e-books have the potential to change our planet for the better.   (2)  E-books, for anyone who is unfamiliar with the term, are about the same size and shape as regular books. They have a large screen in the middle, however. This screen shows the reader a page of text that has been downloaded from a computer. Once the reader has finished reading the page on the e-book screen, he or she scrolls down to see a new page. The process continues until the entire book has been read.   (3)  As you pointed out, Mr. Slocum, it's great to lie on a warm, sandy beach with a book. You can do that just as easily with an e-book as you can with a traditional paper book. In fact, because e-books are so light, you can take them places you wouldn't want to take regular books. Say, for example, that you like to read on the bus. Which would you rather carry with you--a heavy 800-page novel or an e-book that weighs only a few ounces?   (4) Another important advantage is offered by e-books as well. They are more environment-friendly than traditional books. Currently, thousands of trees are cut down each year to meet the publishing industry's demand for paper. Books that don't sell are eventually returned to the publisher and destroyed. This appalling waste could be avoided if everyone used e-books, which require no paper.   Sincerely,   Concerned Citizen

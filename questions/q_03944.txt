They open up a drawer that hadn't been opened for at least two years and see several keyrings.  Naomi pulls out a University of Wisconsin keyring and shows it to Camina.  Camina says, "I don't even know where that came from. Maybe it came with the apartment.  We should just throw it away. I don't think anyone would want that."  They go through several more keyrings until they come to one that looks almost identical to the first University of Wisconsin keyring they had seen in the drawer.  Camina says, "Oh you know what?

25 mL of 0.05 M HF are titrated with 0.1 M NaOH.  Choose ALL statements below which are true for this titration.
When 50.0 mL of 1.00 M hydrochloric acid and 50.0 mL of 1.00 M sodium hydroxide are mixed in a coffee-cup calorimeter, the temperature of the mixture increases from 21.00 oC to 27.50 oC.  Determine if the reaction is exothermic or endothermic and calculate the absolute value of the total amount of heat released/consumed (in kJ) to 3 significant figures Assume that the mass of the combined solution is 100.0 g and the specific heat of the combined solution is 4.18 J/g-oC.

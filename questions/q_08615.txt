Sixty-seven sets of siblings who suffered from insomnia were recruited for a study on a new medication that could help them fall asleep faster.  To support this claim, one sibling was given the medication and the other was given a placebo.  The average amount of time that it took the siblings on medication to fall asleep was 4.75 minutes with a standard deviation of 2 minutes, and the average amount of time that it took the siblings on the placebo to fall asleep was 6 minutes with a standard deviation of 3 minutes.  The average difference in minutes to fall asleep was 1.25 minutes with a standard deviation of the difference of 2 minutes.  Provide a confidence interval for the true mean difference in minutes to fall asleep between the siblings on the medication and those on the placebo.    Interpret the interval you calculated in Question 6 in a sentence.

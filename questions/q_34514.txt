Question 4 (25 points): Tool life and turning operation The diameter of a 75 mm long cylindrical rod is being reduced from 100 mm to 96 mm in two passes of equal depth of cut. The spindle is being rotated at a speed of 600/p revolutions per minute and the feed rate is 0.25 mm/revolution. A high-speed steel cutting tool is being used to cut the material. It is observed that the tool life can be accurately predicted by the Taylor tool life equation VTn = C where n=0.1 and the cutting speed for a tool life of 1 min is 1.20 m/s. Answer the following questions. Show your work and provide justifications. (a) What is the depth of cut per pass? (5 pt) (b) How long will it take to cut the rod if the time taken for tool changes is neglected? (5 pt) (c) What would be the tool life for the first pass? (5 pt) (d) How would be the tool life for the second pass? (5 pt) (e) How many tools will be required to complete the turning operation? (5 pt)

A local animal shelter wishes to provide the proper energy intake for an 11.0-lb adult female opossum (a marsupial mammal).  The opossum is neither pregnant nor lactating, is in good body condition, and appears to be at her ideal body weight.  The shelter is particularly concerned that she not become obese, as she will have limited activity and shelter personnel have heard that opossums have lower energy requirements than most other mammals.  What is this opossum's calculated total daily energy requirement, expressed as kcal digestible energy (DE) per day?

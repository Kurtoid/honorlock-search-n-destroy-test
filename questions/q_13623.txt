Read the following process description and fill-in the blanks. All answers in relation to time should be given in hours. Answers must be numeric only (do not enter units of measurement or words). If an answer is a whole number no decimals are needed.  For any decimal answers round to 2 decimal places (example 0.3333333333 would be 0.33). Before X-ray System: At a Dental Office, patients come in at the rate of 25 per hour and, on average, are processed at the same rate. Patients wait in a queue till they are called up to the counter for registration. After registration, patients are taken to a room where they are assigned a chair where they wait till a hygienist is ready to see them. Once a hygienist sees the patient, they identify them as a routine cleaning or they identify a problem where a dentist is needed to perform major treatments. On average, it is found that there are 25 patients waiting for registration and another 25 waiting to be seen by a hygienist. Based on the above determine the following: I = [a] R = [b] On average, how long (hours) do patients spend waiting in the dental office? Use the information detailed in the above paragraph only.  [c] X-ray System Added: A study has determined that 70% of the patients simply require a routine cleaning. A new x-ray system allows separation of the dental rooms into two treatment areas, one for routine cleanings and another for major treatments. A dental assistant sees a patient after registration, x-rays them, and assigns the patient to one of the two tracks. Patients for routine cleaning are seen by a hygienist who either cleans their teeth and releases them or determines that the dental assistant has made a mistake and the patient really needs major treatment. In this case the patient is moved to the major treatment track. Patients for major treatment are seen by a hygienist who either gets a dentist for further treatment or determines they really are routine cleanings and releases them. It is determined, using the x-ray system, that there are, on average, 25 people waiting to be registered, 5 waiting to be seen by the dental assistant for x-ray, 9 waiting to be seen by a hygienist in the major treatment area, and 7 waiting to be seen by a hygienist in the routine cleaning area. On average, 70% of the patients are classified by the dental assistant as needing routine cleanings. Note: All answers are asking for the wait time either before being cleaned or having major treatment because no activity times are listed in the above analysis. Use only the buffers described to determine your answers. Identify throughput, inventory, and flow time at each stage of the new process including the x-ray system.    Activity  Inventory (I)   Throughput(R)   Flowtime (T)    Registration [d] [e] [f]   X-ray [g] [h] [i]   Major Treatment [j] [k] [l]   Routine Cleaning [m] [n] [o]      (b) On average, how long do patients that have major treatment spend waiting in the dental office after the introduction of the x-ray system (use both paragraphs)? Assume the dental assistant makes no mistakes in identifying a patient as needing routine cleaning or major treatment. [p] (c) On average, how long do patients spend waiting in the dental office after the x-ray system is introduced? Consider both routine cleaning and major treatment patients. Assume the dental assistant makes no mistakes in identifying a patient as needing routine cleaning or major treatment. [q]

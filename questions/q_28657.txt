Determine the value of k with units for the reaction. If you cannot get a rate law for part i, make an assumption for the rate law and clearly write it. Use this to answer this question. iii. Determine the initial rate of the reaction when the initial concentrations of both A and B are 0.750 M. If you cannot get a rate law for part i and a value for k for part ii, make an assumption for the rate law and clearly write it. Use this to answer this question. Free Response 4: A reaction has the rate law, rate=k[A2]. Answer the following questions for this reaction. i. What would be the label of the y-axis for a plot that would produce the straight line shown in the plot above? (2 points) ii. If the initial concentration is 0.100 M, how much time, in minutes, is required to decrease the concentration of A2 to 0.0200 M? (5 points)
During the mediation process, neutrality does not play a factor into a successful mediation.
Read the following excerpt from a Citric Acid Analogy story written by Dr. Whitney. Mr. Acetic Acid (acetate) meets, dates, and marries, Ms. Oxaloacetic acid (Oxaloacetate). They agree that their married name will be Mr. & Mrs. Citric acid. They purchase a house in a great neighborhood. The subdivision is called Cellular Respiration Estates. Their neighbors, the Decarboxylaters, are fantastic. They have formed an association to rid the community of carboxyls. We utilize part of the carboxyl, but there is a portion that is waste-(carboxyls are not useless). The discarded materials will not go to waste because plants thrive off this material. There are clues in the analogy story to help you address the question prompt. Based on the CR analogy story, describe the specific context and application. What do we discard? What do we use?

Three balls, red, green, and blue, have the same mass and radius but they have a non-uniform mass distribution so their moments of inertia do not follow the usual formula.  Their moments of inertia are Ired = 0.02 kg m2, Igreen = 0.04 kg m2, and Iblue = 0.06 kg m2.  If they all roll down the same frictionless slope from rest, which one reaches the bottom first?

Fill in the blank II:  For Questions #11-20, fill in the blank with the appropriate choice from the list of terms below.  Only the best answer will count as the correct answer.  Each answer is used only once in this section. You may find it useful to decide on your answer before looking for your choice in the list of terms.  If there are two blanks in a question, the same answer is used in both blanks. Human children are especially good at acquiring cultural knowledge because they are good at learning from others, they expect adults to donate information to them and because human use of _______ allows humans to transmit kinds and quantities of information which cannot be conveyed using the stereotyped communication found in other animals.  According to Mel Konner, active ________ involves effort to facilitate information transfer such as "deliberate modeling, active encouragement, exaggeration of the movements involved in the task to make it more obvious, or simplification of the task to provide graded steps." This kind of _______ is rarely seen in non-human primates but is common in humans. [Note that the same term is used in both blanks]. In his 1981 book, Robert Fagen asked "Why do young and old animals of many species spend time and energy, and even risk physical injury, performing the apparently unproductive behaviors colloquially called _______? What makes this "useless" activity so important that animals literally risk their lives for it?"   According to Dutch historian ________, the human species should be re-named.  Although humans are currently called Homo sapiens (the wise species), ______suggests humans should be called Homo ludens (the play species) to emphasize that play is a critical feature of human nature.  [Note that the same choice is used in both blanks].   Exuberant over connectivity of neurons during childhood is accompanied by pruning of unused connections and __________of frequently used connections. This principle of brain circuitry construction is known as "use it or lose it." Konrad Lorenz studied a process he called _________ and discovered that newly hatched goslings and ducklings would faithfully follow (maintain proximity with) the first moving object they were exposed to after hatching from the egg. This inspired John Bowlby to conceptualize that a similar (though not identical) psychological system may explain the behavior of young human children who protest separation from their parents. John Bowlby was a British psychiatrist who proposed that young children behave as if there is an invisible _______ which keeps them in close proximity with their mother (their primary caretaker). When something strange and fearful appears, the child decreases the distance to the mother (the ________ shortens). When the environment is peaceful, the child lengthens the _______ and plays with objects in the environment. Bowlby coined the term "attachment" to refer to this behavior and its underlying emotional-motivational system. [Note that the same term is used in all blanks]. According to Bowlby, young children use their attachment with a primary caretaker (e.g. mother) as a ______. In the presence of the attachment figure, the child will begin to explore its surroundings with confidence but in the absence of the attachment figure the young child will be cautious and quiet. Bowlby found that children between 6 and _______ months of age were the most likely to be distressed by separation from a familiar caregiver. Mary Ainsworth developed the "_________ situation" procedure so that the reaction of infants to separation from a caregiver could be studied in a consistent manner (even when the cultural setting was different).

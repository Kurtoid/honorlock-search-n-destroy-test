Calculating GPA Create a C function called gradeValue(). This function accepts one input argument with a single character type. The function gradeValue() should be able to determine the value of a letter grade and return a floating point number which represents the value of the input letter grade.    Letter Grade Value   A 4.00   B 3.00   C 2.00   D 1.00   F 0.00   Others -1.00    Use switch-case statement within the function gradeValue(). Assume that the user always enters a capital letter.

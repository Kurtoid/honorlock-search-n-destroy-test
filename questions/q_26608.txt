A botanist harvests a batch of green onions.  She notes that the stalks have a mean weight of 14.1 g and a standard deviation of 0.7 g.  The stalks have a mean height of 20.3 cm and a standard deviation of 0.9 cm.   a.  Find the coefficient of variation for the onion weights.  Round your final answer to the nearest tenth (one decimal point) of a percent. b.  Find the coefficient of variation for the onion heights.  Round your final answer to the nearest tenth (one decimal point) of a percent. c.  Which has more variability: onion weights or onion heights? d.  Explain why the coefficient of variation is used to determine variability between these sets (instead of the standard deviation).

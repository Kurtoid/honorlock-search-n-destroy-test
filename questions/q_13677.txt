Determine bulk density, particle density, and porosity of a soil. The following parameters are: cylinder height 6.5 cm, inner radius of the cylinder 4.0 cm, and dry weight of the soil 500 g.   Soil volume = ring volume To calculate the volume of the ring:  Measure the height of the ring with the ruler in cm to the nearest mm. Measure the diameter of the ring and halve this value to get the radius. Ring volume (cm3) = 3.14 x r2 x ring height.   Porosity, % = 100 - (bulk density/particle density x 100) Bulk Density = oven dry soil weight/volume of soil solids and pores Particle Density = oven dry weight/volume of soil solids

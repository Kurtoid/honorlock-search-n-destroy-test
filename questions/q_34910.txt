Assume that fuel economy has a bell-shaped distribution.  (Use the empirical rule). What percent of automobiles will have a fuel economy for highway driving between 12.4 mpg and 37.2mpg?
You are interested in receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and you are purifying a novel phosphotyrosine-binding protein (NPBP-1).  In order to characterize this protein you need to separate it from three other proteins (X, Y, and Z) that are still present in your partially purified material.  The proteins in your preparation have the following properties:            binds to phosphotyrosine   Size (kDa)   pI     protein X   yes   85   7.2     protein Y   yes   29   2.9     protein Z   no   31   7.4     NPBP-1   yes   28   7.5       A. What type of separation technique can be used to separate protein NPBP-1 from protein X? [1] B. What type of separation technique can be used to separate protein NPBP-1 from protein Y? [2] C. What type of separation technique can be used to separate protein NPBP-1 from protein Z? [3]

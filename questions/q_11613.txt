Two kids, A and B, are on a balanced seesaw with the pivot point located at the center of the seesaw as shown below. Mass of A = 30 kg and mass of B = 40 kg. Seesaw has a mass of 25 kg.  A)  Kid A sits 1.5 m from the pivot point of the balanced seesaw. Calculate the torque provided by A.  (5 points) B) Calculate the distance from the pivot point to B when the seesaw is balanced and A sits 1.5 m from the pivot point. (5 points) C) Calculate the the normal force (support force) provided by the pivot point on the seesaw. (5 points) D) Now A moves closer to the pivot point so that the distance from A to pivot point is 1 m, and B remains at the same position.  What is the net torque on the seesaw?  Clearly state whether the net torque is clockwise or counterclockwise. (4 points for magnitude, 1 point for direction) E) As A sits 1 m from the fulcrum, B decides to move to maintain the balance. Calculate the new distance from B to pivot point that keeps the seesaw balanced. (5 points)
Consider this selection from Friedrich Engels's, The Condition of the Working Class in England (London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co., 1892), 45, 48-53. On re-reading my description, I am forced to admit that instead of being exaggerated, it is far from black enough to convey a true impression of the filth, ruin, and uninhabitableness, the defiance of all considerations of cleanliness, ventilation, and health which characterise the construction of this single district, containing at least twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants. And such a district exists in the heart of the second city of England, the first manufacturing city of the world.

Everything which here arouses horror and indignation is of recent origin [and] belongs to the ________. Based on what you know about Engels' ideas and developments in England in the nineteenth century, what should go in the blank at the end of the passage?

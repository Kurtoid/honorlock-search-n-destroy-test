Read the Radiology Report below. Find and list the misspelled words using their correct spelling in this report. RADIOLOGY REPORT   Patient Name: Peter Chang            MR#: 900458 Date: 11/12/19 Attending Physician: Marjorie Majors, M.D.                                    DOB: 11/8/49 Procedure: PA and Lateral Chest X-Ray. Indications: Rule out possible newmonia. Progressive shortness of breath and daily cough; some weight loss over the past few months. No old films available for comparison. HPI: The patient presents with increasing difficulty breathing. Approximately 2 weeks ago, the patient had what he termed a brief "head cold" that lasted for 3 days, in which he had decreased energy and appetite. This event included nasal discharge that was yellow in appearance and then improved, though he still notes occasional clear discharge. At that time, he developed a cough, which was worse in the a.m. and improved throughout the day. He notes that the coff has worsened in recent days, in which he brings up occasional yellow-green sputum. He notes pain and tightness on inspiration, which can cause a bout of coughing. He denies fever, chills, or night sweats. He also denies any recent travel outside of the area and has lived here his entire life. The patient also notes a 40 pack-year history of smoking [one pack a day for 40 years], though he has not smoked in the past 5 years. He also notes that he spent some time working as a steamfitter in environments where he was exposed to chemicals that were aerosolized, as well as possibly exposed to asbestos. Findings: The heart size appears normal. The pulmonary vessels appear unremarkable. There is no evidence of pleural effusion. Extensive interstical infiltrates are present throughout both lungs. The findings are consistent with diffuse bilateral interstitial pneumonia or interstitial fibrosis. The lungs are hyperinflated [inflated beyond normal limits], and there are emfysematous  changes in both upper lobes, more prominent on the right. Impression: COPD .

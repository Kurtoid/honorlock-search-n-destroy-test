The existing president Mutharika received 38.57% of votes and his main opponent, Lazarus Chakwera, got 35.41%. it was claimed that more than 1.4 million votes out of 5.1 million were affected by fraud. The president, who was standing for re-election, was also president of the electoral commission which ran the election. The commission failed to manage the election properly because it had not noticed the abuse of power.

Directions: Read the passage. Then answer the questions below by choosing Yes or No from the dropdown menu.    American Sign Language American Sign Language (ASL) is a non-spoken language used mostly by deaf people in the United States. Like other sign languages, ASL expresses meanings by using movements of the body, especially the hands, rather than by spoken words.  ASL probably began with the earliest deaf people in America who invented the language in order to communicate with each other. We know that in the eighteenth century an early version of the language was in use on Martha's Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts. In the early nineteenth century, American educator, Thomas Gallaudet standardized ASL. Gallaudet studied teaching methods at the earliest school for the deaf in France, where the teachers used a sign language now called Old French Sign Language (OFSL). Soon after his return to the United States, Gallaudet opened the first American school for the deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. For teaching purposes the school developed its own sign language. This language was a mixture of the signs the deaf used in France with those used by the deaf in America. Over half of the signs in modern ASL come from OFSL. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, educators for the deaf actively discouraged the use of ASL. They thought that deaf people should learn to read lips and speak, so they could communicate more easily with hearing people. However, deaf people continued to learn ASL informally and use it among themselves. Today ASL is widely used to teach deaf children. People now understand that ASL is a rich and complex language that can express meaning like any other spoken language.     Is ASL a spoken language? [a1] Did deaf people invent ASL? [a2] Was Gallaudet a French teacher before he established the first school for the deaf? [a3] Is it true that over half of the signs in modern ASL come from Old French Sign Language? [a4] Was the first school for the deaf in the United States established in Miami, Florida? [a5]

"This is why Zeus devised sorrows and troubles for men. He hid fire. But Prometheus, noble son of Iapetos, stole it back for man's sake from Zeus, whose counsels are many. In the hollow of a fennel stalk he slipped it away, unnoticed by Zeus, who delights in thunder. So the cloud-gatherer in anger said to him: 'Son of Lapetos, craftiest of all, you rejoice at tricking my wits and stealing the fire which will be a curse to you and to the generations to follow. The price for the stolen fire will be a gift of evil to charm the hearts of all men as they hug their own doom.'"

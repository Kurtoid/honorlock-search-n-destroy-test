Begin Now(!) Following the Instructions (below)  Record the script you prepared and practiced into the text box for this question.  As stated in the rules in the instructor prep lesson prior to this test, you are allowed to have the printed script on a single sheet of paper in front of you on your desk or table.   Open Record/Upload Media or your alternate video recorder. Pan the camera around the room and desk to show that both the room and desk are empty. Show and video-record your photo ID. Put down your ID. Do not hold your ID in front to your face while speaking, The only way I have of knowing it is you completing the oral work is to see  both your Photo ID and then to see you speaking on the same recording (this procedure is called course authentication). Record with good oral expression (Record with feeling and friendly facial expressions); you are telling a story about "yourself" and you want to be certain that the listeners want to listen to you or even meet you. Your fluency (no hesitations and restarts) and "feeling" (good oral expression) will earn you points!  Your oral narration will tell me if you truly understand what you are saying. Take part of your set-up time to read the "Scene"; it will tell you exactly what I am looking for! When finished, follow the instructions at the bottom of this question.  Escena (Scene)   !Felicitaciones! You have been chosen to represent the college in a national, televised, speaking contest!   You are pretending to be the person in the paragraph, and you are talking via online video to an online voting audience about a day with your family and friends.   First prize is two years of full scholarship (including room and board), and a million-dollar scholarship endowment to the college!   Of course, you want to win the contest, and to do so you recognize that you must have such great pronunciation, fluency of speech, and oral expression, that the entire audience will want to vote for you - even the family and friends of your competitors!   If you are female, use your own name (instead of Pedro).   If you are male, use your own name (instead of Pedro).  !Buena suerte!  Step1: Oral Presentation  To begin recite the title of your story. Then video record your story exactly as it appears below.   If you are female, use "Ana" as your name. If you are male, use Pedro as your name.

El domingo pasado, a la una de la tarde, asisti a una reunion de estudiantes en el gimnasio de la universidad. Mi hermana, Alicia, y mi hermano mayor, Diego, tambien asistieron a la reunion.

Step 3:  How to Correct before Submitting  Before saving, listen to be sure you have good volume and you have a good, error-free, rendition;  If not satisfied, re-record as much as you wish. Save/Upload/Submit (whichever is appropriate for the recorder you are using), your final recording to this question. Revising with the Canvas Recorder: If you accidentally save or submit before you have finished, you may have to refresh the page to use the Canvas Recorder again. (But, since this is a one-attempt exam, if the refreshing action keeps you from accessing the question again, you will have to keep the recording you saved.)  The possibility of being locked out of the question if you refresh, highlights the need to have practiced intensely.   If you do end up with more than one recording in the text area, label the recording to grade as "Final" so I will know which one you want me to listen to and grade!

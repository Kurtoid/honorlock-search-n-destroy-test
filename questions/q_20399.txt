It has been widely reported that postsecondary education is necessary for entree to the middle-class job market of the future. The requirement for higher education, coupled with dramatic increases in the costs of attending college, leaves many students unable to overcome the financial barriers of college attendance. Community colleges continue to serve the majority of underrepresented American students, including first-generation college students, minority students and adult learners looking to advance to middle-class jobs. A recent study shows that for every dollar invested in community colleges, society realizes $25.90 in benefits as students become contributing members of the workforce and rely less on government-funded services. The proposal clearly outlines that all parties will need to invest -- students must meet eligibility and grade requirements, states must provide matching funds and colleges must implement evidence-based programs and services to increase the number the successful students. Our nation has benefitted greatly from investing in higher education. It is time to reinvest in America's prosperity. - by Dr. Walter G.

For a theory to be accepted, it must first correctly match the known facts.  But that is not enough: it must make what are referred to as testable predictions. In other words, it must make predictions that experimentation can verify.  It will be accepted if they are verified, but rejected if not. This set of matching is related to the foundations of the Big Bang Theory (BBT), to the relevant properties of the Known Universe, and to those requirements that it be testable. For each of the following aspects involved in the foundations of the Big Bang Theory, find the corresponding item at right and match it to the corresponding aspect.

After reading the poem below, answer the following question: The poem's main tension (conflict) comes from... The Chimney Sweeper    By William Blake     When my mother died I was very young, And my father sold me while yet my tongue Could scarcely cry " 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!" So your chimneys I sweep & in soot I sleep. There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved, so I said, "Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare, You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair." And so he was quiet, & that very night, As Tom was a-sleeping he had such a sight! That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, & Jack, Were all of them locked up in coffins of black; And by came an Angel who had a bright key, And he opened the coffins & set them all free; Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing they run, And wash in a river and shine in the Sun. Then naked & white, all their bags left behind, They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind. And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy, He'd have God for his father & never want joy. And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark And got with our bags & our brushes to work. Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm; So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.

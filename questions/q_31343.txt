Use the following information to answer the questions below A sheep breeder has maintained very careful records from a series of crosses involving two traits. One trait is the height of black hairs above the hooves. This trait has two phenotypes: black extending approximately 12cm above the hooves (Full Black = F) and black only 3 - 4cm above the hooves (Short Black = S).  It is clear from the breeder's data that leg hair height follows a simple Mendelian pattern with Full dominant to Short (F -> S).  Unfortunately, the breeder is having a little more trouble understanding the second trait (Coat Color: White - W and Cream - C).  He has obtained the same results many times from his crosses. And Reciprocal crosses always gave identical results. Here is one example where he crossed his prize winning female (known to be homozygous at both loci) with a male.  All the offspring survived (no lethal alleles).

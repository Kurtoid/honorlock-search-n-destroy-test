The recessive allele (e) does not permit production of black hair, and horses that are genotype ee are described as red (also called chestnut).  Consider the following population of horses:  52 chestnut horses, 67 bay horses, and 5 black horses. Determine the frequencies of the E and e alleles in this population.

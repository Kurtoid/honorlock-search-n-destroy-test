She lives alone and was found on the kitchen floor from an apparent fall, and had been there for approximately 2-3 days. She had a hematoma on the right side of her head, and she had outward rotation of her right leg. She has a history of Hypertension (on Lopressor), mild arthritis, has occasional Bronchitis especially during Spring, and had a Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy 3 years ago.  Her Initial V/S in the ER are:  T - 100.1;  B/P  116/76;  HR - 86; R - 22; O2 Sat - 95% on room air.

Consider a two-dimensional flow field defined by its velocity components u = (x-2y) m/s and v = -(y+2x) m/s, where x and y are in meters.    Does a velocity potential exist? If so, find it. Does a stream function exist? If so, find it. Find the horizontal and vertical acceleration of a fluid particle passing thru the point (x,y) = (1ft, 1ft)    Show all details of your solution procedure. Work on your own paper.  When you are finished, type in the values you obtained for the horizontal and vertical accelerations below.  You will still need to upload your written work in a separate step after you close the exam.

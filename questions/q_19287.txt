Kosmopolitos Bank, an international commercial bank with headquarters in Athens, Greece and branches throughout the world, accepts dollar deposits.  Zip Corp., a US firm active internationally, deposited $ 10,000,000 in the Curacao branch of Kosmopolitos Bank in the form of a six-month certificate of deposit ("CD"); the deposit to be closed and the sum plus interest to be transferred to Zip's Austin, TX bank at the end of the six-month term.  However, just before the CD's due date, the Curacao government, in response to a massive outflow of foreign capital resulting from a crisis triggered by a mega-tsunami that devastated much of the Caribbean, blocks all hard currency transfers in excess of $ 50,000 out of all Curacao bank deposits.  Zip Corp. has retained you to represent it in a lawsuit to be filed against Kosmopolitos Bank in Chicago, where Kosmopolitos Bank has a branch.  The theory of the suit is that the Chicago branch is liable for the Curacao branch's default.  What is Kosmopolitos Bank's best argument to foreclose your recovery suit?

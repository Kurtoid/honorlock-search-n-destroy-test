VRAAG 5 'n 0,5kg blok is geheg aan 'n 0,3kg blok deur middel van 'n ligte toutjie. Die 0,3kg blok hang vertikaal soos die toutjie oor 'n wrywinglose katrol getrek is. 'n Horisontale krag van 6N werk in op die 0,5kg blok wat op die horisontale oppervlak gly, soos in die diagram hieronder aangedui. Die 0,5kg blok ondervind 'n wrywingskrag van 2N.  Regtertklik op die blou blok hieronder om die diagram in 'n nuwe "tab" oop te maak.       5.1   Stel Newton se Tweede bewegingswet.   (3)      5.2    Teken twee benoemde vryliggaam diagramme om die volgende aan te toon: Die horisontale kragte wat op die 0,5kg blok inwerk en and vertikale kragte wat op die 0,3kg blok inwerk.    (4)     5.3   Bereken grootte van die versnelling van die sisteem.   (3)     5.4   Bereken die grootte van die spanning T in die toutjie.   (2)     5.5   Wat moet die grootte van die toegepasde krag wees op die sisteem om dit teen 'n kontante snelheid te laat beweeg?   (3)             [15]

Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr A sample of gas collected at 21.0degC and 0.868 atm, has a volume of 1.83 liters.  What volume will the gas occupy if the temperature is increased to 38.0degC and the pressure is reduced to 0.658 atm?  To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem. Show your work (equation/and units) by using the equation editor() in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use   to insert ratio. Be sure to include proper units and the final answer! Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

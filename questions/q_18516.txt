You are in a position to recommend whether the public transportation agency for which you work should use project bundling, and which projects to bundle.  Your agency covers a large, but sparsely populated state.  It is a significant distance between one corner of the state and another, but the driving is easy, since, except for two urban areas, the traffic is light.

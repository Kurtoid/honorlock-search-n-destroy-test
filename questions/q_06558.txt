Would you solve the system of equations 3x2-2y=5x+3y=-4{"version":"1.1","math":"3x2-2y=5x+3y=-4"}using elimination or substitution? Why? Both methods work so either is correct. I am looking at your answer for why. Also, solve the system of equations and give your answer using whole numbers, fractions, and symbols. Answers written with decimals will receive no credit.

Please use the following information to answer the question(s) below.For several decades now, amphibian species worldwide have been in decline. A significant proportion of the decline seems to be due to the spread of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Chytrid sporangia reside within the epidermal cells of infected animals, animals that consequently show areas of sloughed skin. Infected animals can also be lethargic, which is expressed through failure to hide and failure to flee. The infection cycle typically takes four to five days, at the end of which zoospores are released from sporangia into the environment. Zoospores are spores of fungi (as well as some algae and protozoans) that use a flagella for swimming locomotion. In some amphibian species, mortality rates approach 100%; other species seem able to survive the infection.Sexual reproduction has not been observed in Bd. A Bd sporangium initially contains a single haploid cell. Which of the following processes must be involved in generating the multiple zoospores eventually produced by each sporangium?1. S phase2. cytokinesis3. mitosis4. meiosis
During which stage of meiosis do homologous pairs separate?

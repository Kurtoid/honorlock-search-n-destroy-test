VRAAG 3     3.1   Lees die geval hieronder en beantwoord die vrae wat volg: Lesh-Nyhan Sindroom (LNS) is 'n skaars maar dodelike menslike genetiese siekte wat deur 'n resessiewe alleel wat op die X-chromosoom aangetref word veroorsaak.

By geboorte funksioneer babas met hierdie sindroom normaal, maar soos uriensuur in hulle liggame opbou, vind vertragings in motoriese ontwikkeling plaas. Dit veroorsaak swak spierontwikkeling, onwillekeurige spierspasmas en matige geestelike vertraging. Teen die ouderdom van 2 tot 3 jaar begin lyers dikwels tekens van of selfverminking, soos die byt van hulle vingers, lippe en binnekante van hulle monde, toon. Sterftes is gewoonlik a.g.v. infeksies, nierversaking of uremie (hoe uriensuur vlakke in die bloed) en vind plaas tussen die ouderdomme van 10 en 30. Nadat Anna en Mike, wat beide gesonde mense is, se enigste seun met LNS gediagnoseer was, het hulle die geskiedenis van die siekte in hulle families begin ondersoek. Mike se familie het geen geskiedenis van die siekte gehad nie. Tot Anna se verbasing moes sy by haar ma uitvind dat haar oom die siekte gehad het en dat hy daaraan dood is nog voor Anna se geboorte.

A client hospitalized with a diagnosis of chronic renal failure (CRF) is experiencing hypotension, cold and clammy skin, and dysrhythmias.  An arterial blood gas (ABG) is drawn with orders to notify the physician if abnormal.  Based on the following results,  pH 7.20, PaCO2 32, HCO3 14, PO2 80, a nurse should notify the physician to report that the client is experiencing:

For this question, answer it on your work paper. In the box below, type "complete" when finished. Make sure to show all of your work.  Suppose a buffer is prepared by adding HF to NaF     Ka: = 3.5x10-4 a)  What mass NaF must be added to 725 mL of 0.120 M HF to give a buffer solution with a pH of 3.3?  Assume a negligible change in volume as the solid is added.   b) Explain how this buffer maintains a nearly constant pH when small amounts of strong acid or strong base are added.  Be specific and include relevant chemical equations (As in use this particular buffer when adding a strong base and when adding a strong acid) to support your answer.

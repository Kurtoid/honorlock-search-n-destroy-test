As a part of your responsibilities at a research I institution after the doctoral program, you routinely review manuscripts for various journals, conferences, and so forth. One day you came across a manuscript in your review folder that compares the standardized path coefficients of the mediation model using data collected in the US and China. You further noticed that for the measurement model, it used CFA. And then, it switched to the OLS regression analysis to test for the moderation effects. Although the current statistical analysis is acceptable, you believe the moderating effects may be better assessed using an SEM-based multigroup analysis.  Please prepare a constructive comment by describing the assessment procedure of measurement invariance first. Using Steenkamp and Baumgartner (1998), identify all needed steps in carrying out the measurement invariance tests for the study including what to look for in each step according to the authors. (10 points) Please explain the procedure in details to evaluate the significance of the moderating effect on a path coefficient using a multigroup analysis including what to look for by the authors. (10 points) Illustrate potential moderated mediation or mediated moderation including the condition(s) required for one over the other. Please use a simple example in answering this question.

Mammary glands are present, but nonfunctional, in males.
Imagine you are studying dimple frequency in different human populations. For this particular study, you are interested in the populations of India and Mauritius island. This trait is defined by two alleles, E1 and E2. Let's imagine allele E1 has a frequency of 0.3 on the island of Mauritius and a frequency of 0.8 in the continent (India). You initially collected data for 1000 individuals. In five years, you go back and identified that additional 300 individuals migrated from India to Mauritius island (Now, your N = 1300). What would be the frequency of E1 on the island in the next generation? Use the One-Island Model. Round up and estimate to four decimal points (the system is very sensitive, so please estimate the numbers correctly). p'1 = (1 - m)(pI) + (m)(pc)
Mr. H has experienced food poisoning with severe vomiting and diarrhea.  He was admitted to the hospital secondary to dehydration.  He is extremely weak and is presently unable to ambulate.  Your PT orders are for functional and gait training.  Upon the initial evaluation, you note that his resting heart rate is 115.  His medical chart states that he has no history of cardiac disease. What do you suspect is causing his elevated resting heart rate?

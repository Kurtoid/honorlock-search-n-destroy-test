A researcher conducted a study to determine if collagen was effective in relieving joint pain. The two leading brands of collagen powder supplements were tested.  120 people were randomly selected for the experiment and the amount of joint pain on a scale of 1 to 10 was recorded at the end of the experiment. Identify each of the following:  Experimental units: [experimentalunits] Factor(s):  [factors] Response variable: [responsevariable] Treatments: [treatments] On you paper, draw an outline of the experiment.

12)  In December, Toby was talking with his 80-year-old grandfather about the COVID-19 vaccine.  Toby asked his grandfather how likely he was to get vaccinated.  His grandfather answered - "Probably about 90%."  In January, when Toby was speaking with his grandfather again, his grandfather said, "I saw on the internet that the vaccine has a microchip in it that changes your DNA!  That worries me a lot. There's only a 10% chance that I'll get vaccinated now."  Toby had heard these conspiracy theories before and walked his grandfather through all the evidence showing that these claims aren't just false, but are totally ridiculous.  At the end of the conversation, Toby again asked his grandfather how likely he was to get vaccinated.  His grandfather answered - "Probably about 75%."   The fact that Toby's grandfather was still less likely to get vaccinated than he was in December, even after hearing that the information about microchips in the vaccine was completely false, is most consistent with what decision-making issue?

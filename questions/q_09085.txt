The 30-kg block is connected to a spring of negligible mass with a force constant 250 N/m as in the figure below. The spring is unstretched as shown in the figure, and the incline is smooth. The 20-kg block is pulled a distance of 20 cm down the incline so that the 30-kg block is 40 cm above the floor and is then released from rest. Find the speed of each block when the 30-kg block is 20 cm above the floor (that is when the string is unstretched).

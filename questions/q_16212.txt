The table below was used during the analysis phase of a value engineering study to select a sunlight screening for windows. Each of the six alternative screening types is evaluated for a number of evaluation criteria using a scale from None to Excellent (None = 0, Poor = 1, Fair = 2, Good = 3, and Excellent = 4). If you find it difficult to select any of the table cells, use the "Tab" key on your keyboard to switch from adjacent cells.

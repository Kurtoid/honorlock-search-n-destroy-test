I recommend Excel. Enter the total charges into the blanks in dollars and cents. Do not use the $ sign. Canvas will drop the last decimal if it ends in zero; this is normal. For all problems, follow this sequence: compare to the next weight breakpoint, apply discount (if any), then compare to the minimum charge.

Silverman Co. is considering Projects S and L, whose cash flows are shown below. These projects are mutually exclusive, equally risky, and not repeatable. If the decision is made by choosing the project with the higher MIRR rather than the one with the higher NPV, how much value will be forgone? Note that under some conditions choosing projects on the basis of the MIRR will cause $0.00 value to be lost. (CLUE: When there is a scale difference MIRR and NPV criteria may pick different projects. Here we want to know if we go by MIRR and pick the best MIRR project how much we will loose in terms of NPV)  Cash Flow    r:    8.75%                     Year   0   1   2   3   4     CFS    -$1,100   $375   $375   $375   $375     CFL    -$2,200   $725   $725   $725   $725

For the following two questions (20 and 21) consider a study of the prevalence of a mutation in the HBB gene resulting in b-thalassemia. Researchers classified a total of 20,000 male and female individuals sampled from the population into three groups (homozygous wildtype, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant) and tested whether prevalence of the HBB gene differs according to sex. What is the measurement scale of the dependent variable in this problem?

Consider the following redox reaction: IO3- (aq)  +  3 H2SO3 (aq)  -  3 SO42- (aq) +   I- (aq)  +  6 H+ (aq) The oxidation number of I in IO3- is [ON1];  Include proper sign for oxidation number. If the oxidation number is 0, no need to include sign. For example, +1, -1, or 0. The oxidation number of S in H2SO3  is [ON2].   In this reaction, [what1] is oxidized; You can't do subscript or superscript. Just type in your answer without using subscript or superscript. Include the charge in your answer, if applicable. For example, enter MnO4- as MnO4-. Don't include the state of matter. and [what2] is the oxidizing agent.

11) A research study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dementia on direct medical costs. Ninety demented residents were divided into three groups based on their level of dementia: mild, moderate, or severe. The medical claims data were collected from CMS Medicare database. Test the hypothesis at the alpha level of .05 that the average mean direct medical costs for the three groups are all equal. Assume that the direct medical costs for each group follow a normal distribution and that the population variances for the three groups are all equal. Based on this information, what is the most appropriate statistical method to test this hypothesis?

Serial ten-fold dilutions are made from a broth culture of Bacillus subtilis in order to determine the number of bacteria in the culture.  Following the dilution series, 0.1 ml of a 1:10,000 (1 x 10-4) dilution is plated, the plate is incubated, and 110 colonies are counted.  Calculate the number of bacteria in the original Bacillus subtilis culture. Don't forget units! Make sure your answer reflects proper scientific notation! Use the ^ to denote an exponent, i.e. 1 x 10-4 would be written as 1 x 10^-4. Note: Don't forget the units. No points without units!

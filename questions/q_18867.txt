The sequential approach to concession-making
Consider the following scenario: you are working at company who has just licensed a new library. One of the methods in that library is a sorting algorithm that the documentation says has "a very fast polynomial run time". Unfortunately, "very fast" isn't a technical term and your boss asks you to perform empirical benchmarking on the algorithm to determine its Big-Oh. Specifically you need to run the algorithm on some inputs, compute the power (or b) of the algorithm's Big-Oh order, and then display the b value. The signature of the sorting algorithm is: public static void entitySorter(Comparable[] a). You may use both the Java math library and the Stopwatch class from lecture. For reference, the API for the Stopwatch class is given below. Assume the Stopwatch is super accurate and will give good values even the time being measured is very small. (Hint: log2(x)=log10(x)/log10(2))    public class Stopwatch Description    public Stopwatch()   creates a stopwatch. starts counting.     public double elapsedTime()   return elapsed time since creation.        import java.math.*; import Stopwatch; //generates an array of random test data of specified size. public static Integer generateData(int size) { //ASSUME ALREADY IMPLEMENTED } public static void methodBenchmarker() { //TODO: write this code! System.out.println("The algorithms power is b=" + b); }

Consider the following table that represents part of the memory of a 16-bit address space that has an addressability of 2 bytes (like LC-3):    ADDRESS CONTENTS   ... ...   0x0C10 0101 0010 0111 1011   0x0C0F 0000 1000 1100 1101   0x0C0E 1010 0101 0000 1101   0x0C0D 0110 1010 0001 1111   0x0C0C 0111 0000 0101 0100   0x0C0B 0000 1100 0000 1101   ... ...    The table above shows the addresses in hex (base 16) and the contents at the corresponding address in binary (base 2). A.) Interpret the contents at address 0x0C0C as two ASCII characters. [ascii] B.) Interpret the contents at the same address as A.) above as an unsigned integer. [unsigned] C.) Interpret the contents at address 0x0C0E as an LC-3 instruction to determine the operation.(Enter either ADD, JMP, LDR, or OTHER if it is not one of the first 3) [instr1] Recall that a "pointer" is a memory location that stores an address. We call it a pointer since the address it stores "points" to another memory location. D.) Interpret the contents at address 0x0C0B as a pointer.(Enter hex like the following example: 0x2A3F) [ptrvalue] E.) What are the contents of the memory location that the pointer above is pointing to?(Enter hex like the following example: 0x2A3F) [ptevalue]   REFERENCE: Partial Table of Hex to ASCII Characters:  20 sp 30 0 40 @ 50 P 60 ` 70 p 21 ! 31 1 41 A 51 Q 61 a 71 q 22 " 32 2 42 B 52 R 62 b 72 r 23 # 33 3 43 C 53 S 63 c 73 s 24 $ 34 4 44 D 54 T 64 d 74 t Table of LC-3 Opcodes in Hex:  ADD 0x1 JMP 0xC LDR 0x6

For this quiz, the following information is provided:  Periodic Table  Ions to Know  Solubility Rules   Formatting instructions for answers typed into quiz textboxes:   If subscripts or superscripts are needed, use the subscript, T2 or superscript, T2 buttons.  If the wrong one is displayed in the menu bar, click the down arrow next to it to choose the other one. Click on the button to turn it on, then click on it again to turn it off.   For numbers in scientific notation, you can use E or the superscript button, T2.  So, either 1.5E9 or 1.5x109. If you need to make a textbox larger, grab and drag the dotted triangle just outside the bottom right corner.

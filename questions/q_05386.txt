Skill B2.  (This problem is based on the port selection problem described by De Icaza et al., 2019.)  Suppose that the decision-maker is concerned with only four attributes (depth, number of berths, number of cranes, and traffic delay), and a linear multiattribute utility function (w1 u1 + w2 u2 + w3 u3 + w4 u4) is a reasonable model of the decision-maker's preferences (u1 = utility for depth, u2 = utility for berths, u3 = utility for cranes, and u4 = utility for delay).  Swing weighting is used to determine the weights on these four attributes.  The five hypothetical alternatives are H0 (every attribute has its worst value), H1 (best value of depth), H2 (best value of number of berths), H3 (best value of number of cranes), and H4 (best value of traffic delay), and these have the following scores: 0, 100, 50, 85, and 15.  Determine values for the weights that are consistent with these scores.

Please explain in detail the significance of the following findings on examination of this patient (only cover those findings that pertain to the systems covered so far)    The patient is an elderly man who appears tired haggard and underweight. His complexion is sallow. He coughs continuously. Sitting in a chair, he leans to his right side, holding his right chest with his left arm. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 152/90, apical heart rate 112/minute and regular, respiratory rate 24/minute and somewhat labored, temperature 102.6F. Examination of the neck reveals a large, non-tender hard lymph node in the right supraclavicular fossa. Both lungs are resonant by percussion with one exception: the right mid-anterior and right mid-lateral lung fields are dull. Auscultation reveals bilateral diminished vesicular breath sounds. Bronchial breath sounds, rhonchi and late inspiratory crackles (are heard) in the area of the right mid-anterior and right mid-lateral lung fields. The remainder of the lung fields is clear. Percussion and auscultation of the heart reveals no significant abnormality. Examination of the fingers shows clubbing.

Follow the instruction below to answer this question: 1. Copy the graph below to your answer sheet.   2. Use your best artistic skill and draw the energy band diagram for a pnp transistor with VBE = 0.3 V and VBC = 2 V.  Use the collector as the electric ground.  Quantify the energy the quasi-Fermi level difference between the emitter and the base, as well as the quasi-Fermi-level difference between the base and the collector.  Your plot should reflect the feature of the quasi-neutral region in each section of the transistor. Random drawing or erroneous QFL assignments will receive zero credit. 3. Identify the biasing mode of this transistor:

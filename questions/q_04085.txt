Refer to Figure D, which gives the marginal cost of pollution clean-up for a four-firm economy. So for example, for Firm A to reduce pollution by the first unit would require it spends $50, for the second unit $100, the third $150, and for the fourth unit it would require $250 and that it had already reduced pollution by the first three units (spending $300 to clean up the first three units). If the government sets standards for pollution, requiring that all firms reduce pollution by the same amount, how much would an 8-unit pollution reduction strategy cost society? Hint: find the cost of reducing 8 units uniformly among the four firms, or 2 units each.

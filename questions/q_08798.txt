The data for this problem (and the next two questions) is from a paper that is modifying the surfaces of graphene oxide for applications in removing dye and other charged pollutants from wastewater. They used a substrate of graphene oxide (GO) because it has a unique 2-D structure with high surface area and rich functional groups, such as carboxylic, epoxide and hydroxide groups, which endow it with good dispersibility in water as well as functionality for further modification.     To test their surface functionalization, they used XPS and TGA (among other things).  The XPS spectra shown below were measured for the various stages of functionalization according to the schematic above.        - In this technique, what is emitted from the atoms?  (characteristic x-rays / characteristic photons / photoelectrons / auger electrons).  [1] -  What is directly measured by the velocity of travel of the emitted things using hemispherical plates?  (incident / kinetic / binding) energy? [2] -  If they had shown the O1s peak region, would it be at a (lower or higher) binding energy?  [3] - The peak for carboxylic acid groups, represented as C(O)OH, is at highest binding energy because this group's carbon is the most (acidic / oxidized / reduced / charged). [4] - The different colors shown for each of the different peaks represent peak (deconvolution / subtraction / splitting / shielding). [5]

A load cell is made of 4 strain gauges in a "Full Bridge" Wheatstone bridge circuit. All the strain gages are attached to the load cell's elastic member and all have a nominal resistance of 300 Ohm at zero strain. After the elastic member is loaded the resistance of each strain gauge is measured below. SG1: 301 Ohm;   SG2: 301 Ohm;   SG3=299 Ohm;   SG4=299 Ohm If Strain Gauge #1 (SG1) is wired as Resistor #1 (R1) in the Wheatstone bridge circuit below determine a suitable location for the remaining strain gauges in order for the load cell to function properly.

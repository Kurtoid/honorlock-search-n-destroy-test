First part of the question, according to Mr. Cox, among public health scholars which case is considered the landmark case to establish the proper equilibrium between the rights of an individual and society as a whole? As discussed in class this Supreme Court case upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. The case dates back to the early 20th century when a pastor who was a leader in his community resisted mandatory vaccinations for smallpox.  The court rejected the pastor's claim that the 14th amendment gave him the right to refuse vaccination and the state's state punishment of a fine or imprisonment on those who refused vaccines was acceptable. The court's ruling established foundational law with important implications for the protection of Americans' legal rights and equality for the government's ability to protect all citizens against infectious disease epidemics and many other potentially catastrophic health threats. Please identify this specific foundational law from the quiz from that module.  For the second part, which U.S. Supreme Court case decided that Congress not only has the power to lay taxes to the level necessary to carry out its other powers enumerated in Article I of the Constitution but also provided broad authority to tax and spend for the "general welfare."

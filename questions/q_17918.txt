Short Answer 4 Nigel is a researcher interested in behavioral enrichment for zoo animals, and wants to investigate the effects of two types of foraging enrichment on chimpanzee behavior.  He plans to compare foraging puzzles, in which the chimps have to extract food out of a central apparatus, to scatter foraging, in which keepers hide and scatter small food bits across the entire enclosure.  Nigel plans to measure the amount of time chimps spend foraging and feeding in each enrichment condition.  One of his lab assistants, Zak, suggests that he run his experiment using an independent-samples design, so that a different set of chimps are used for each enrichment condition.  Nigel's other lab assistant, Bronson, suggests a related-samples design, in which the same set of chimps receives both conditions. a. If all other factors are equal, which design (Zak's or Bronson's) should have greater statistical power? Briefly explain why.  (4 pts.) b. If all other factors are equal, which design should have a greater risk of a Type II error? Briefly explain why.  (3 pts.)  PLEASE LABEL YOUR ANSWERS WITH (a) and (b).

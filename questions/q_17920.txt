What is the market value of the following mortgage loan: original terms were a loan of $317,000 with monthly payments for 30 years at 5.75%. Assume that 10 years have passed and that no prepayments have been made. Current market rates on new 20-year mortgages similar to the old loan are at 2.5%.      (5 pts.)  My mother is retired and has no source of income other than Social Security.  She owns her home outright, and I have suggested that she consider a reverse annuity mortgage (RAM) to supplement her monthly income.  Suppose her home is currently worth $650,000 (which it is not, by the way).  The bank offers her a RAM with a 50% loan-to-value ratio compounded monthly over 10 years at an interest rate of 4.75%.  By how much can she supplement her monthly income?      (12 pts.)  A lender makes a 70% LTV convertible mortgage loan at a below-market rate of 5.5% on a property selling for $14,500,000.  The term of the loan is 20 years; however, the lender has a conversion option at the end of the 5th year.  At the end of the 5th year, the lender can convert their debt position into a 50% ownership stake in the property.  If the property appreciates at 3.5% per year over those first five years, should the lender exercise their option?        (12 pts.)  I am shopping for a mortgage to finance a medium apartment complex.  Second Auburn Bank offers me a 60% LTV shared appreciation mortgage (SAM) in the amount of $4,700,000.  This loan charges a below-market rate of 4.75% compounded monthly, as well as a 0.5% origination fee.  The mortgage will be amortized based on a 30-year term, but the balance will be due at the end of 10 years.  In addition to the balance due at that time, I must also pay the lender 50% of any appreciation in the value of the complex.  I expect that the apartment complex will increase in value at an average rate of 2% per year (compounded annually) over the next ten years.  If I take the SAM, and if my expectation about appreciation is correct, what is the effective rate?      (6 pts.)  The following is an excerpt from an amortization table for a price level adjusted mortgage.  The original terms were a 1.5% $280,000 fully amortizing price level adjusted mortgage for 30 years with monthly payments.  The inflation adjustment at the end of year one is expected to be 2.5%.     Period   Beginning Balance   Payment   Interest   Principal   Ending Balance     10    $274,425.15   $966.34   $343.03   $623.31    $273,801.85     11    $273,801.85   $966.34   $342.25   $624.08    $273,177.77     12    $273,177.77   $966.34       $624.86         13           $349.21   $641.29    $278,725.44     14    $278,725.44       $348.41   $642.09    $278,083.35     15    $278,083.35                $277,440.46     16    $277,440.46       $346.80   $643.69

Researchers have long debated different hypotheses for the phylogeny and classification of species in the bear family, Ursidae. In 2008, researchers obtained complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome sequences for the eight living species of bears. Based on these data, the researchers constructed a phylogenetic tree for the family Ursidae.    Which branch point represents the most recent common ancestor of the brown bear and the American black bear?
Splanchnic nerves

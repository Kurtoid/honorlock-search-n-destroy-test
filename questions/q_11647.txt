(2001) collected fresh fecal samples from 16 female elephants (Loxodonta africana) in three different groups over 23 months at Tarangire National Park, Tanzania, and analyzed them for fecal progesterone and cortisol metabolites. Social and ecological measures (rainfall) were collected concurrently. They noted a decline in body condition during the dry season.

They also noted that most births occurred during the wet season (Fig. 1).

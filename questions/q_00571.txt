Testing based on Functional Equivalence Partitioning - Park Entry Fee (ticket price) On weekday, the park's ticket price is shown below: Price:   0                      for    Age: 0-2Price: 15                      for    Age: 3-54Price:   5                      for    Age: >=55 On Saturday and Sunday, the ticket price is doubled. A function, tPrice takes in two parameters: (age, dayOfWeek)  age: an Integer dayOfWeek: an Integer, 0 - 6 indicates Sunday to Saturday, other values are not allowed The function returns the ticket price. Use functional equivalence partitioning approach to design test cases for this function. You should have at least three levels of partition (not counting the root). You must show your partitioning tree.  Generate one test case for each leaf node. Note each test case should look like:  ((age, dayOfWeek), ticket_price) For example: ((10, 1), 15) ((60, 0), 10) ((-1, 0), Exception)

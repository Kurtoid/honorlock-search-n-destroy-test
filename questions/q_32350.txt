Choose any four out of the following six short answer prompts, and write your responses in the provided space. Each question is worth 25 points. You will not get more points by answering more than four of these prompts.   You are the decision maker of a local conservation organization with the mission to purchase ecologically valuable private properties to put into permanent conservation. You are given the opportunity to acquire a large tract of land in North Central Florida near the Santa Fe River. All you currently know is that it contains mostly secondary mixed forest and abandoned fields. The forest also contains a small spring and creek. Purchase of this property would consume most of your organization's acquisition funds. List three methods you would use to assess the ecological value of the property as comprehensively as possible. Explain your reasoning (i.e. what insights you would gain from using each type of assessment) in two to three sentences each.   The number of Florida Black Bears (Ursus americanus floridanus) in Florida has increased from 300 animals in 1974 to 4000 today, and it continues to increase. During the same time period, Florida's human population has nearly tripled. Bears increasingly venture beyond the boundaries of protected areas in search for food and habitat, leading to human-wildlife conflict. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) is now seeking advice from experts (meaning you!) on whether or not to implement hunting as a bear population control strategy. In a paragraph, explain how you would go about preparing your report to the FWC, i.e. explain what steps you would take to arrive at a decision whether or not to support the hunting plan. Use scientific rationale and try to avoid being influenced by your personal feelings about hunting.   In a paragraph, explain why the essay The Tragedy of the Commons should not be regarded as a paradigm for understanding human population growth and its environmental impacts.   In 2-3 sentences each, briefly describe three issues that populations of sexually reproducing organisms face when they fall below the minimum viable population level.   In a paragraph, explain the difference between engineering and ecological resilience, including the assumptions underlying each concept.   The TEEB project, as explained in the TED talk by Pavan Sukhdev, has the aim of "Making Nature's Value Visible". Explain, in a paragraph, how they go about doing this, referencing terminology from lecture 8: People and Resources about resource economics.

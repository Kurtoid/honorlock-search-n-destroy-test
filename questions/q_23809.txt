A pulley of mass mC, radius R, and radius of gyration kC is supported by a cord shown in red in the figure below. The segment of the cord from A to B is inextensible, but the segment from D to E can stretch with spring constant k. The pulley supports a hanging mass, mP, by means of a light, inextensible cord CP.  The system is released from rest with the spring initially unstretched. Assume that the cord does not slip on the pulley. (a) (20 points) Find the expression that can be used to find the speed of the disk center C after point C has traveled a distance d downward. (b) (5 points) If the hanging mass mP is removed and replaced by a constant force P = mPg downward, will the answer in part (a) go up, go down, or remain the same? Briefly justify your answer.

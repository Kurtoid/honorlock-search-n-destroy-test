Let   be a length   sequence of positive integers. The maximum sum increasing subsequence of   is any increasing subsequence of it with the largest possible sum. Suppose you want to design a dynamic programming algorithm to find the sum of a maximum sum increasing subsequence of a given sequence.While there may be many solutions to this problem, one of the recurrences on the list below would achieve a working algorithm. Select the correct recurrence relation. You do not need to explain your answer. Example:  Input:  . Output: 18  (Since 5,6,7 is the maximum sum increasing subsequence, even though the longest increasing subsequence is 1,2,3,4,51 but this only sums to 15.)

10. Which of the following is false?  A. Daniel Callahan suggests that the moral logic of the motives for euthanasia and PAS contain within them the ingredients of abuse. B. Daniel Callahan's arguments are unsupportive of the AMA's view concerning not only PAS, but also euthanasia. C. To argue against PAS, Daniel Callahan argues that if you oppose the death penalty because you believe life is always worth saving, then you should oppose PAS too. As Callahan argues, if you believe that life is so valuable that even the life of a convicted murderer is worth saving, then you should conclude that suicide is never an acceptable solution, and therefore PAS is never morally acceptable.

AFDELING A:  LEESBEGRIP         VRAAG 1         Teks A      Lees die begripstoets TWEE  keer deur en beantwoord dan die vrae.                      Deel 1: Volstruis maak tone nat op Kaapse strand 1 'n Vrou van Kaapstad kon nie haar oe glo toe sy 'n volstruis in die vlak seewater by Kaappunt sien nie.           2 Kayleigh Tuck, 'n 27-jarige sosialemedia-inhoudskepper, is Saterdag na Kaappunt omdat sy gemeen het dat die ander strande 'n bietjie te vol is. Die laaste wat sy verwag het was om te sien hoe 'n volstruis in die see kom tone natmaak. "Ek kom nie baie by Kaappunt nie en ek het ek volstruise daar gesien maar nog nooit in die water nie," se Tuck, wie se kerel 'n video daarvan gemaak het. Die video is op TikTok en Instagram gelaai.           3 In die video is die een volstruis min gepla met die skare wat hom dophou terwyl hy in die water loop.  Daar is nog twee volstruise wat op die strand rondloop en die skare van naderby bekyk.           4 Tuck beskryf die video, waarop Toto se "Africa" gehoor word: "Net nog 'n dag in Afrika".           5 Die video is al meer as 386 000 keer op TikTok gekyk. "Dit was een van daardie oomblikke wat ons net moes afneem. Hoe gereeld sien 'n mens volstruise in die see?". Tuck se sy dink die volstruise het warm gekry en wou afkoel.           6 "Dit kan ook wees omdat die strande tydens die inperking (lockdown) gesluit was en daar nie baie mense gekom het nie. Toe hulle Saterdag mense sien, het hulle seker gedink: 'Waar kom al die mense nou skielik vandaag? Dis ons strand,'" skerts sy.             7 Tuck se mense moet die natuurlewe respekteer wanneer hulle diere in openbare plekke teekom.           8 "Dieselfde geld die pikkewyne op Boulders-strand. Gun hulle hul ruimte en respekteer hulle." (268) Uit Volksblad Feb 2021

Re: Two social work faculty developed a secondary prevention program for families with a known history of maltreatment; it involves bi-weekly home visits by a social worker who is trained in family systems interventions. These faculty, in collaboration from allies in the Department of Children and Families lobbied long and hard to secure State funding for a demonstration project using this program. The program developers were designated as the evaluators, and because this is a program evaluation, it was exempt from IRB review. Families were informed about the evaluation and asked to participate without going into detail about potential harms, benefits, or privacy of data. The expectation was that the program would show a significant reduction in reported child abuse incidents. Instead, the results showed a slight but significant increase in reported child abuse incidents and a higher rate of re-opened CPS cases among participating families within the first 3 years (using CPS administrative data). The investigators were perplexed and very concerned about withdrawal of State funding for this program. An evaluation report to the funder portrayed the program in a favorable light by highlighting program satisfaction as well as qualitative input from some of the program participants. The findings regarding the impact of the program in terms of reported child abuse incidents were included but the report cast doubts about the credibility of these findings, pointing to (minor) problems with the evaluation methods. ------------------------------------------------------------------- The higher rates of child abuse reports and re-opened CPS cases for families involved in this study could be a function of heightened scrutiny of families monitoring by the social service system, an unintended consequence.

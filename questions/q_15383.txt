Lis ce poeme et reponds aux questions suivantes. Read this poem and answer the following questions.   << Les chats >> par Charles Baudelaire   Les amoureux fervents et les savants austeresAiment egalement, dans leur mure saison,Les chats puissants et doux, orgueil de la maison,Qui comme eux sont frileux et comme eux sedentaires. Amis de la science et de la volupteIls cherchent le silence et l'horreur des tenebres;L'Erebe les eut pris pour ses coursiers funebres,S'ils pouvaient au servage incliner leur fierte. Ils prennent en songeant les nobles attitudesDes grands sphinx allonges au fond des solitudes,Qui semblent s'endormir dans un reve sans fin; Leurs reins feconds sont pleins d'etincelles magiques,Et des parcelles d'or, ainsi qu'un sable fin,Etoilent vaguement leurs prunelles mystiques.   Choisis la bonne reponse en choississant la bonne lettre. Choose the correct answer by choosing the correct letter.

Fills any extra space with the null character.   strchr(str1, char1) returns a pointer to the first occurrence of char1 in str1.   strrchr(str1, char1) returns a pointer to the last occurrence of char1 in str1.   strstr(str1, str2) returns a pointer to the first occurrence of str2 in str1.   strlen(str1) Returns the length of string str1.   strtok(str1, del) Splits string into tokens on any character in delimiter string. One split per call.   strcmp(str1, str2) If str1 and str2 are equal returns 0. If str1 is alphabetically before str2 or a substring of str2 returns a negative number.

Table1 presents 5 data points with 2 variables of x1 and x2. We compute the distances between pairs of 5 data points using Euclidean distance in Table 2. Assume we find 2 clusters A (A contains points 1, 2, and 3), and B (B contains points 4 and 5). Find the correct analysis (round to the nearest hundredth or +2 decimal places).

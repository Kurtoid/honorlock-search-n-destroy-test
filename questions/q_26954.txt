(Q001) Texas municipal governments may pass local laws known as ordinances, which govern behavior within the city limits. Generally, these ordinances do not generate much controversy, because their scope tends to be limited. Houston, however, held a referendum on an antidiscrimination ordinance in November 2015 that gained national attention and was one of the most bitter and costly local elections in Texas history.Texas is one of 28 states with no statewide laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In the absence of a state law, Houston's proposed ordinance would have prohibited bias in city housing, employment, city contracting, and business services on the basis of a number of criteria, including race, age, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The core of the political argument surrounding the ordinance was the ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.Opponents reframed the political debate from one of civil rights for gay and transgendered persons to a claim that the law would allow sexual predators in women's bathrooms. Signs reading "No Men in Women's Bathrooms" were displayed outside polling places, and television ads showed a young girl being followed into a bathroom stall by an older man. Opponents of the ordinance included Governor Greg Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who used the bathroom argument to support their position. Megachurches from the Houston area and former Houston Astros star Lance Berkman were strong opponents of the ordinance as well.Supporters of the ordinance included Houston's then mayor Annise Parker, who had been elected as the first openly gay mayor of a U.S. city and who argued that passage of the ordinance would show that "Houston does not discriminate." Groups such as Equality Texas, the ACLU, and the Human Rights Campaign also strongly supported the ordinance. Actress Sally Field was a well-known celebrity supporter, and Hillary Clinton, President Obama, Vice President Biden, football player Michael Sam, and actors Eva Longoria, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and Matthew Morrison used social media to show their support. Another actor, Matt Bomer, released a video calling on Houstonians to vote "yes," saying, "I was raised with the belief that everyone deserves to be treated equally. These are the same values I grew up with in Houston and they're the same values that I try to teach my kids."The ordinance failed overwhelmingly by a 61 percent to 39 percent margin in November 2015, but the issue did not go away. It returned during the 2017 legislative session when conservatives sought to pass legislation that would have restricted transgendered Texans from using restrooms, showers, and locker rooms. The debate was contentious and, at times, nasty. Big business, particularly large corporations with interests outside Texas, came out against the bill. In the end, the "Bathroom Bill" was killed in committee by Speaker Joe Straus. For his part, Straus believed that the bathroom bill could prove emotionally devastating to some transgender people. In no uncertain terms he stated, "I don't want the suicide of a single Texan on my hands." No one would be surprised if the Bathroom Bill is resurrected for the next session of the state legislature in 2019.Should cities' lawmaking powers be limited to local concerns such as traffic or animal control issues, rather than broader issues such as antidiscrimination laws?

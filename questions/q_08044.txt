Questions 7-10 are based on the following scenario: Evilan works on the final layout of the processor design at Processon, a company that designs and manufactures processor chips. After a series of poor investment choices, Evian has decided that his only path to truly luxurious life is a path of crime, so he has inserted a hardware Trojan into Processon's next-generation processor. The hardware Trojan continuously monitors the value of the stack pointer (SP) register, and does nothing unless the value of SP is 0x87654321. However, when SP does equal this value, the Trojan changes the processor's execution mode to Hypervisor mode, which allows full access to everything in the computer system, including memory locations that belong to the operating system and other users' programs. Evilan's plan is to wait for this processor to be deployed in data centers around the world, at which point Evilan will be able to purchase some user-mode execution time on various data-center servers, obtain other users' banking information, and finally buy a tropical island (and a mega-yacht to take him there in style). Evilan is pretty sure that his hardware Trojan will not be discovered during testing (or normal program execution) because the SP register normally points to very high addresses (e.g. 0xFFFFFFF0), and the addresses it normally points to are aligned to a 4-byte word (e.g. 0x87654320 or 0x87654324), so the value of 087654321 is highly unlikely to ever end up in the SP register unless Evilan's code sets it to that value.

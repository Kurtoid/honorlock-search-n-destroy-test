A 100.0 mL sample of 0.300 M NaOH is mixed with a 100.0 mL sample of 0.300 M HNO3 in a coffee cup calorimeter. If both solutions were initially at 35.00degC and the temperature of the resulting solution was recorded as 37.00degC, determine the DHdegrxn (in units of kJ/mol NaOH) for the neutralization reaction between aqueous NaOH and HCl. The specific heat capacity of water = 4.18 J/gdegC. Assume 1) that no heat is lost to the calorimeter or the surroundings, and 2) that the density and the heat capacity of the resulting solution are the same as water.

Kaitlyn is preparing a gourmet dinner for her boyfriend. On the menu is a garden salad with vinaigrette dressing, grilled ribeye steak, roasted potatoes, and parkerhouse rolls. Kaitlyn begins by making the rolls. After mixing all of the ingredients, she lets the yeast ferment, which causes the bread dough to double in size due to the gas produced. Next she prepares the salad dressing by adding some dried herbs, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil to a cruet. She shakes the dressing until an emulsion forms. For the salad Kaitlyn grates rainbow-colored carrots, slices some bright-red tomatoes and washes some green, leafy lettuce. Last, she prepares the grill using lump charcoal, which provides a nice even heat when burned. When her boyfriend arrives, she grills the steaks, which are perfectly marbleized. Once the steaks are seared, she removes them from the grill.The statement, lump charcoal produces an even heat when burned, best describes a

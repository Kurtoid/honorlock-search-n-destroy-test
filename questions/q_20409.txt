8. Determine the location/orientation of the image (using ray tracing method) of an inverted object located to the left and outside the focal length of a DCX.                                           9. A 4.2 mW HeNe laser beam is focused using a DCX (focal length 250 mm). The spot size area is 6.7 x 10-7 cm2. Determine: a) the spot radius, b) the divergence of the laser beam                                       10. Determine the minimum deviation angle of a prism knowing that the apex angle is 80deg and the refractive index is 1.365.                                         11. A two-lens system is made up of a converging lens followed by a diverging lens, each of focal length 150 mm. The system is used to form an image of an object 1.5 cm high, standing erect, 270 mm from the first lens. The two lenses are separated by a distance of 60 cm. Describe the image formed by this system.                                   12. You are handed a CX with a radius of curvature of 48 cm and an object is placed 48 cm in front of the mirror. a) What is the focal length of the mirror? b) Where is the image located at and how far is it from the mirror? c) Is the image found in part b) real or virtual? Explain. Draw a diagram. d) Is the image larger or smaller than the object?  By what magnification?                                             13. White light is incident normally on the surface of a soap bubble. A portion of the surface reflects red light of wavelength l0 = 650 nm. Assume that the refractive index of the soap film is near that of water, so that nf = 1.33. Estimate the thickness (in nanometers) of the soap bubble surface that appears red in second order.                                                 14. A laser (450 nm) is diffracted from a reflection diffraction grating. The grating has 8.9x103 lines/cm. Determine: a) The angles for the observed diffraction orders; b) What is the total number of orders observed? c) In order to decrease the number of orders observed does the source wavelength needs to be increased or decreased?
5.   The sled was started from rest and pushed until it reached a steady (constant) velocity toward the right.  Which force would keep the sled moving at this velocity?

At time instance A, following is happening in the network: Station 2 wants to send data to Station 1. Station 4 wants to send data to Station 3. Station 5 and 6 just finished a successful communication. All six stations have to contend for the channel, i.e. only one channel is available to all of them for use. Answer the following questions:  1. Station 6 is not hidden to station 2. True or False? Explain your answer. (2 Pts) 2. Is station 5 hidden to station 2? Explain your answer. (2 Pts) 3. Is station 6 hidden to station 1? Explain your answer. (2 Pts) 4. Based on your answer in (1), can you tell if communication between Station 5 and 6, which ended at time instance A, was based on RTS/CTS or regular (Data/ACK) mode? Explain your answer. (2 Pts)

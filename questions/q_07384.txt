SUMMARY QUESTION             Your older sibling has been annoying everyone at home as several of his/her/their lecturers have recently called him/her/them a genius, and now he/she/they enjoy bringing this up as often as possible.

Provide your own heading at the top of your note.   10                           Points to note:  Your summary should be in the form of one coherent paragraph. Your summary should be no longer than 90 words. Include an accurate word count at the end of your summary. Do NOT include the heading in your word count. Write in the appropriate register.

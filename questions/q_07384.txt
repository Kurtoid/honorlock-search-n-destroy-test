Based on the age structure above, which country has the highest birth rate?
Dirk required surgery for a kidney impairment. His total bill for medical services was $50,000. Dirk has a medical expense policy with a $1,000 calendar-year deductible and a $5,000 annual out-of-pocket limit. His coinsurance percentage is 20 percent. The out-of-pocket limit applies to coinsurance only. Assuming this surgery and hospitalization were the first medical care that Dirk received during the year and that all of the hospital services were eligible for coverage under the policy, how much of the $50,000 bill will the insurer pay?

Some students have been told that people remember words that are written in green ink better than red ink. Therefore, I collected data from 2 sections of Psych 202. My 2:30 pm class had a list of words in green ink to memorize. My 4:00 pm class had a list of words in red ink to memorize. After a delay, student recalled as many words as they could. My 4:00 pm class with green ink had a mean of 27.5 words, SS = 720, n = 36. My 2:30 pm class with red ink had a mean of 21.5 words, SS = 610, n = 36.

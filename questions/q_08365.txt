For each of the following, determine if the statement is true (T) or false (F).  If the statement is false, explain why it is false.    All synovial joints are diarthrotic.  Action potentials are generated in both dendrites and axons.  Troponin blocks myosin binding sites on actin.  Slow oxidative muscle fibers contain myoglobin and are more highly vascularized than fast glycolytic muscle fibers.  Sutures are amphiarthrotic cartilaginous joints.  Muscle tendons are critical for joint stability.

Give an interval around the mean where you believe most (approximately 95%) of the television viewing times fell in the distribution.

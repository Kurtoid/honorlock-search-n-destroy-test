Potassium aluminum sulfate "Alum" is an aluminum compound with many valuable uses. One is it serves as an intermediate to making other aluminum compounds. You synthesized "Alum" using the two step process below:              Al+3 (aq)    +   K+2 (aq)  + 2 SO4-2  +   12 H2O (l)  --------------------->   KAl(SO4)2 *12 H2O (s)   The equation above is balanced with one mole of aluminum ions producing one mole of Alum. In the chemical reaction, the aluminum (Al) is the limiting reactant. Calculate the percent yield is 31.36 grams of Alum is obtained by starting with 2.522 g of aluminum (26.98 g/mol). The molecular weight of Alum is 474.10 g/mol.    To illustrate scientific notation in your answers write the significant digits, then type "E", followed by the exponent. An example is: "2.34 x 10-3",  should be typed as "2.34E-3".

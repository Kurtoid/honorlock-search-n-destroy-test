Questions 9 and 10 refer to the following passage: Finally, China and Japan were on somewhat different paths when the Western challenge intruded in the mid-nineteenth century. China was suffering one of its recurrent dynastic declines. Government became less efficient, intellectual life stagnated, and popular unrest surged.

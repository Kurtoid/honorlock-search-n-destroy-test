DIRECTIONS: Choose the best answer for each question. Sextuplets [A] Most of us have met a pair of twins or triplets once or twice in our lives. But how many people know a set of sextuplets: six children born at the same time to the same mother? Not very many of us have. This is why the Dilley family is so famous.[B] Keith and Becki Dilley got married in 1986 and wanted to have children right away. After five years of no children, doctors gave Becki a special medication to help her get pregnant. It worked! But Becki wasn't pregnant with just one baby. She was pregnant with five - or that's what the doctors thought at first. [C] On May 25, 1993, Becki went to the hospital to give birth. The doctor delivered five healthy babies before Becki felt a sixth set of feet. The last Dilley baby, the sixth one, was quite a surprise. The babies had to stay in the hospital for several months. Some of them needed special machines to help them breathe. Others were so small and fragile that Becki and Keith could not hold them. After three months, the babies were finally able to go home.[D] Life in the Dilley household was quite busy, as anyone can imagine. There were six diapers to change, six bottles to prepare, six tiny outfits to wash, and so on. Thankfully, the Dilleys had family nearby who could help carry the load. Grandparents, aunts, and uncles all pitched in to help.[E] The sextuplets are grown up now. They have families of their own and work at various jobs. They seem to be just like other young adult, but they always have an amazing story to tell.Which paragraph describes all the work the Dilleys had to do to take care of the babies?

You are a microbiologist working on a team to come up with a plan to treat patients coming in with a strain of Treponema pallidum (the bacterium causing syphilis infections) that is resistant to Penicillin G, which is normally used in the community you are working in to treat syphilis infections. You don't know have any information about what mechanism of resistance the strain of T. pallidum has to Penicillin G yet. Two alternative antibiotics are available to you (Ampicillin and Doxycycline). As you can see in the image below Penicillin G and Ampicillin are structurally very similar, while Doxycycline is structurally different from both. Based on this information, which antibiotic do you think would be the best bet for successfully treating patients infected with the resistant strain? (Hint: This is NOT a trick question. Don't overthink it)

You have 2.00 kg of ice at -20.0oC in a thermally isolated container. You add enough water at 50oC to the container so that the contents of the container reach thermal equilibrium at 20oC. Assume that no heat is lost to the surroundings and that only what is inside the container changes temperature.  Thermal information for water in different phases is given in the table below.    Long-answer problem: at the end of the exam submit your work for this problem using the special final exam assignment link. Be clear and logical in each step. If you do not submit your work you will receive ZERO points for this part.     a) Find the heat (energy) required to increase the temperature of the ice to its melting point.

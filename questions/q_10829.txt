An experiment exposed mice to varying light conditions at night. The scatterplot of Body Mass Gain versus Percent of Calories showed evidence of a linear relationship.    The resulting least squares regression line equation  Body Mass Gain = 1.622 + 0.115 x Percent of Calories has an R2 value of 0.5866. What does the least squares regression line equation predict for the body mass gain (in grams)  for a mouse who eats 50% of its calories during the day? [a] (Round your answer to two decimal places.) What is the value of the correlation coefficient? [b] (Round your answer to two decimal places.)

11. Describe the principle of operation of pyroelectric meter.                                         12. Draw the Fresnel reflections produced by a positive lens. From which surface (1st, 2nd) the reflections present an eye hazard and why?                                         13. An atom, making a downward transition from the 4th to the 2nd energy level, releases a photon. Determine the (a) energy (J), (b) frequency, (c) wavelength, and (d) wavenumber for this photon.                                         14. Determine the values of the amplitude reflection/transmission coefficients for light incident at 300 on an air-glass interface (ng=1.50).                                       15. What percentage of the incoming irradiance is reflected/transmitted at normal incidence on an air-flint glass (1.66) interface?                                       16. The output power of an argon laser operating at a wavelength of 700 nm is measured by a photoelectric power meter with a detector 150 mm in diameter. Figure 1 illustrates the meter calibration curve. The calculated irradiance is 577 mW/cm2. Determine the power of the laser.

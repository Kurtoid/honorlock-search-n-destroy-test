Arwell is a small startup company whose stock is not traded frequently because it is not a public company. Arwell acquires a new pickup truck in exchange for 5,000 shares of its stock plus $5,000 dollars in cash. The last time that Arwell raised capital by issuing stock was on Shark Tank when Mark Cuban invested in them at a stock price of $10 per share. Kevin O'Leary thought that Mark was crazy for making such a high offer after Kevin had offered only $5 per share moments earlier. If Arwell had purchased the new pickup truck from a dealership, they would have paid $35,000. At what amount should Arwell recognize the truck on its books?

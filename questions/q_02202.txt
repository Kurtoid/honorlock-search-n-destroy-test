Problem 4a) Finite State Machines ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner. The tool bar has indent functions. In 4a), 4b), and 4c)  we will write a finite state machine (FSM) named FSM011 for the problem defined. Our FSM will find the sequence 011 embedded in an arbitrary sequence of bits wherever it occurs (use variable x), assume overlapping. Generate an output Z=2'd3 whenever this sequence is detected, otherwise Z=2'd1. Use a standard Finite state machine design organized in problem 4 parts a), b), and c) which is below. Inputs must be x, reset, clk, and outputs must be State, and Z.  A state transition table (which contains the same information as a state diagram) is supplied in 4c) In this problem 4a) write   the module statement,  a localparam statement that does a state assignment (you must use the state assignment table provided below in 4c), and  any declarations of local variables.  (if you find you need a local variable in problem 4b) or 4c), declare it here)  Be complete. You can look forward to 4b) and 4c) to see the entire problem if that helps. For maximum credit your code should carefully follow the specification, and your grade will depend that. Use the minimum number of lines to accomplish this specification. For problems on this test use System Verilog, always_ff, and always_comb, and don't use reg datatype. Also use proper indentation for organization. Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables. Do not use compiler directives. ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate

These questions are related to the design principles for secure systems.  Many people use the same password across many websites. Give an example of a design principle for secure systems that is violated by the use of the same password across different websites. Provide a brief explanation. (4 pts.)  The "Reflections on Trusting Trust" paper described a trojan in a compiler binary that could not be detected even if we had access to the source of the compiler. We discussed how the defense in depth principle can help us detect if the trojan exists in a compiler by using two independently developed compilers when at least one of them is correct. We could determine if one of the compilers has the trojan but could not ascertain which one is malicious. To answer this question, the following idea is proposed. Instead of two, we will get three independently developed compilers such that no more than one could be malicious. Can we use these three compilers (at least two of them are good) to detect the bad one when one exists? Explain your answer. (6 pts.)

Ukuzimisela nenhlanhla nakho kudlala eyakho indima ekutholeni impumelelo. Isimo somqondo sibaluleke kakhulu ekutholeni impumelelo empilweni. Impumelelo iqala ngombono , bese uphenduka  uba yiphupho. Okubalulekile ukuthi lowo ofuna impumelelo abe nesiqiniseko ukuthi iphupho lelo analo ngelakhe, hhayi elabangani bakhe noma abazali bakhe. Kubalulekile ukuthi umuntu abhekisise ukuthi lelo phupho lingaphumelela yini. Uma amathuba okuthi liphumelele emakhulu emaningi, kuhle ukuhlela ukuthi lokhu kuzokwenzeka kanjani. Ukuhambisana kwephupho nethalente umuntu analo kwenza ukuthi kube lula ukufinyelela empumelelweni.     2   Wonke umuntu ufisa ukuzibona ephumelela empilweni. Ziningi izinto abantu abafisa ukuphumelela kuzo. Kungaba yisemshadweni, emsebenzini, emabhizinisini nakwezinye izinto empilweni. Akusiye wonke umuntu ophumelelayo. Ukuze umuntu aphumelele kubalulekile ukuthi azazi yena, azi ukuthi usukaphi, uyaphi futhi ufunani empilweni. Okubaluleke kakhulu ukuthi umuntu aqonde kahle okumele kumlahlekele ukuze athole impumelelo. Ngenxa yobulukhuni bendlela eya empumelelweni, baningi abakhathala endleleni.     3   Isikhathi esiningi abantu abangaphumeleli bahlala benezizathu zokungaphumeleli kwabo. Basola abanye, bakhale ngemvelaphi yabo, isimo emphakathini, imithetho kaHulumeni nokungafundi. Ophumelelayo uzitshela ukuthi noma zikhona lezi zinto ezibalwe ngenhla kodwa uzophumelela. Umuntu ofisa/ofuna impumelelo uyazi ukuthi izinkinga ngeke zingabi khona kodwa akazivumeli ukuthi zime endleleni yakhe yokuphumelela. Akalindi ukukhuthazwa abanye ukuze aphumelelise iphupho lakhe. Akasoli muntu ngobunzima azithola ekubona ngenxa yokufuna ukufeza iphupho lakhe.     4   Uyazi ukuthi nguyena okufanele asebenze kanzima ukuze amaphupho akhe aphumelele. Umuntu ofuna impumelelo kumele adele okuthile, njengokuzijabulisa, ukuchitha isikhathi nabangani, nobuthongo imbala kanye nomndeni wakhe. Impumelelo akuyona eyabo bonke abantu, kodwa ngeyabantu abanomqondo ohlakaniphile. [Umbhalo wokuziqambela]   RIGHT CLICK ON THE BUTTON BELOW TO OPEN TEXT C IN A NEW TAB

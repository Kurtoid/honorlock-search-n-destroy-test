People with acrophobia (fear of heights) sometimes enroll in therapy sessions to help them overcome the fear.  Typically, seven or eight therapy sessions are needed before improvement is noticed.  A researcher conducts a study to determine whether a new pill, used in combination with two therapy sessions will help people with acrophobia overcome the fear of heights. Altogether, 38 people participated in the study.  Half of the 38 people were randomly assigned to receive the new pill and two therapy sessions, and the remaining half received a placebo and two therapy sessions.  After the two therapy sessions, none of the 38 people received additional pills or therapy.  Five months after the pills and two therapy sessions, each of the 38 people were evaluated to see if their fear of heights had improved.   a. Fill in the blank.

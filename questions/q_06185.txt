Questions 40-43 refer to a toy car which can move to the right or left along a horizontal line (the positive portion of the distance axis).  The positive direction is to the right.                                           Choose the correct velocity-time graph (A - G) for each of the following questions.  You may use a graph more than once or not at all.  If you think that none is correct, answer choice J.  40.          Which velocity graph shows the car moving toward the right (away from the origin) at a steady (constant) velocity?

The voltaic cell below uses the standard half-cells Ni2+ | Ni and Mg2+ | Mg, and a salt bridge containing KCl(aq). The voltmeter gives a positive voltage reading.  Identify A and write the half-reaction that occurs in that compartment.      Mg2+(aq) + 2e- - Mg(s)        Edeg = -2.37 V Ni2+(aq) + 2e- - Ni(s)           Edeg = -0.28 V

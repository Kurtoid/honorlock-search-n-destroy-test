The total solute concentration of a red blood cell is about 0.9%.  Sucrose cannot pass through a red blood cell's plasma membrane, but both water and urea can.  Which of the following solutions will cause a red blood cell to shrink?
This diagram below shows a transverse plane view of someone performing the down phase of a bench press. Inverse dynamics have been performed to analyze the first two segments (hand and forearm) so that the joint reaction force and the joint moment acting AT THE ELBOW ON THE FOREARM have been determined (REF and MEF). Use this information and the other information in the table below to move up the kinetic change and perform a dynamic equilibrium analysis of the upper arm to solve for the joint reaction force at the shoulder acting on the upper arm.     Joint Reaction Force at the Elbow on the Forearm  REF = 5 x + 300 y (N)   Mass of Upper Arm  m = 4.1 kg   Linear Acceleration of the Upper Arm  a = -0.3 x + 0.7 y

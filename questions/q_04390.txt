For this question, assume that we have an image processing piece of software called MiniShop.  It is a command line tool that takes a list of options and input values and the name of an image file on which to operate.  For example, to create an 800x600 pixel cropped image anchored at (127,67) in the original image, the user would type the following at the command prompt:    MiniShop   -crop   127   67   800   600   original.jpgand it would save the new image to original-crop-127-67-800-600.jpg as a result. Provide a single fully formed heuristic evaluation entry to describe the usability problem that this would represent, with all of the elements it should have (eg: describe the problem, identify the one heuristic it most violates and why, explain the practical issues that the existing approach will cause, provide a realistic severity rating and why, and suggest a fix).

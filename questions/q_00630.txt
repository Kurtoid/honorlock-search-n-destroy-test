Consider the reaction shown:   A (aq) +  2 B (aq)  -->  C (aq) +  D(aq) The following data were obtained at a particular temperature.    Trial [ A ], M [ B ], M Initial rate, M/min   1 0.0400 0.200 0.0809   2 0.0800 0.300 0.971   3 0.0800 0.200 0.647   4 see the next line ?    In Trial 4, 40.0 mL of a 0.500 M solution of A are mixed with 30.0 mL of a 0.260 M solution of B.  Use unrounded answers in the calculation steps.  Report your answer for k using correct sig figs.  You can use decimal format or E format. In decimal form for numbers less than 1, always enter the 0 before the decimal point. You should use E format when the power of ten is +/-4 or larger or to properly show sig figs. To enter scientific notation, use E format with no spaces, i.e. for 1.23x10-4 type 1.23E-4.  You must show your work in the file you upload to receive full credit. You'll be asked to type in your rate law in the next question. Fill in the following blanks with the appropriate answer. The order with respect to A is [A] The order with respect to B is [B] The value of the rate constant using trial 1 is [k] The units for the rate constant k are M[unit1] min[unit2] The rate for Trial 4 should be [rate] M/min
EXHIBIT 1 A real estate company is planning its next multifamily housing development, which will consist of two types of rental apartments, large apartments (x1) and small apartments (x2). The company has to decide how many of each type of apartment to build in order to maximize its annual profit. A large apartment has a profit contribution of $5,000 per year, and a small apartment has a profit contribution of $3,000 per year. A large apartment requires 1,000 square feet of building space and a small apartment requires 500 square feet of building space. The development will have a total 80,000 square feet of available building space. On average, the annual cost of advertising a large apartment is $200, and the annual cost of advertising a small apartment is $400 (more expensive because of more frequent turnover). The company has an annual advertisement budget of maximum $40,000. Finally, the company has a maximal funding of $18,000,000 to invest in building these apartments. A large apartment typically costs $200,000 to build, and a small apartment $150,000. The decision variables are defined as: x1 = Number of large apartments to build x2 = Number of small apartments to build           Large apartment (x1)   Small apartment (x2)     Profit contribution   $5,000   $3,000     Building area required   1,000 sq. ft.   500 sq. ft.     Advertising cost   $200   $400     Investment needed   $200,000   $150,000       Please solve the problem described in this Exhibit using the Excel Solver.

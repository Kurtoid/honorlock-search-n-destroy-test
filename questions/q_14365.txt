Researchers at Gallup chose a random sample of 1,020 American adults, who were aged 18 and older.  The 1020 American adults were asked to respond to the following question: "Please tell me how much trust you have in banks." Gallup reported that 36% of the 1,020 adults indicated that they had very little or no trust in banks. The margin of error for a 95% confidence interval calculated using this sample was 2.8%. How can we get a smaller margin of error and still be at 95% confidence?

This came as an email to me. It is a survey embedded in an email but the survey no longer works. Don't worry about taking the survey as it is not required to answer the questions. The questions I am asking below (in the drop downs) are focused on content we've learned in our class together. Again, don't worry about the survey or taking it on-line, just read the questions in relation to what you've learned in class. Each answer is worth 4 points. Answer the following questions: 1. This nonprofit is focusing on [answer1] 2. It is not surprising that IPA is affiliated with a top-notch university in the U.S., because their approach uses [answer2], the most stringent form of evaluation. 3. This kind of data (Q#2) would most likely be used by which nonprofit rating agency we studied in class as their primary means to rate the best nonprofit organizations involved in malaria reduction? [answer3] 4. The option C approach below is more likely to be done by a [answer4] rather than a regular charity-based nonprofit.                                         Worldwide, there are 500 million cases of malaria each year, and as many as 1.5 million people die annually from the disease. It is well-established that insecticide-treated nets (ITNs or bednets) are effective in preventing the spread of malaria, but there has been much debate in the past about whether to charge for the bednets or distribute them for free. Randomized evaluations have shown that one approach substantially increases their use.   Can you guess which approach worked best?                           A:      Providing the bednets for free.                     B:      Subsidizing the bednets and charging a nominal fee.                     C:      Selling them at full price.

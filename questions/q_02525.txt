Bacterial Transformation   Some species of bacteria produce pigments that can be used as non-toxic dyes in manufacturing.  In order to control the production of such a pigment, the redP gene was cloned into the pGLO plasmid, replacing the gfp gene.  This new plasmid, pRED (see map below) now carries three genes - the bla gene for resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin, the araC gene to allow for arabinose regulation, and the redP gene needed for the synthesis of red pigment.  The expression of the redP gene is under the control of the pBAD promoter.   To test the new pRED plasmid, a scientist first spreads 0.1 ml of E. coli bacteria on nutrient agar (NA) plates, containing one or more supplements as indicated below.  All plates were incubated at 37degC overnight to allow time for bacterial growth.  In the space below, state whether or not growth would be expected.  Also, if growth is expected, what color(s) will it be? NA plate:                                                                      NA + Ampicillin plate:   NA + Arabinose:                                                           NA + Ampicillin +Arabinose plate:   Next, a small amount of E. coli bacteria was transformed with pRED, and 0.1 ml of the transformation mixture was spread on the same series of plates.  All plates were incubated at 37degC overnight to allow for bacterial growth.  In the space below, state whether or not growth would be expected.  Also, if growth is expected, what color(s) will it be? NA plate:                                                                   NA + Ampicillin plate:   NA + Arabinose:                                                           NA + Ampicillin +Arabinose plate:

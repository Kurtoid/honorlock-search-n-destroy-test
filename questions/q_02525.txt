Suppose you want to find the reaction enthalpy, DHrxn for the reaction,    X2 + O2  --> 2XO         DHrxn = ???  kJ where X is an imaginary element, by adding some combination of the reactions below.  You are not going to actually add the enthalpies for these reactions, but rather determine the multiplier for each reaction that will make them add to the reaction above.  If you use a reactions as written enter a "1"; if you need twice a reaction then enter a "2"; if you need to reverse a reaction, enter "-1".  If you do not use a reaction, enter a "0", etc. The only accepted answers are "0,  1/2, -1/2, 1, -1, 2, or -2". Enter one of these answers in each blank corresponding to each reaction in order. 1)  X2 + 2O2 --> 2XO2                       DH = 50 2)  2XO + O2 -->  2XO2                    DH = -100 3)  XO2  + X2   -->  X2O + XO         DH = -50

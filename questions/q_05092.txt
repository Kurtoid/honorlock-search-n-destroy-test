Remember to write equations and show all your work (no pun intended). A gnome named Herve, mass = 6.7 kg,  slides down a frictionless slope, from a height of 4.0 m above the base.  He starts with initial velocity v0 = 5.4 m/s down the slope.  At the base of the slope, on level ground, he hits a rough patch and slows down.  The rough patch is 4.4 m across and the coefficients of friction between the floor and the gnome are mk = 0.42 and ms = 0.50. Find Herve's kinetic energy, K (in Joules), after the rough patch.

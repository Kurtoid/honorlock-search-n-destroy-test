1. [20 points] A manufacturer uses 45000 units of an electronic board per month. Their supplier offers a marginal unit discount scheme to the manufacturer which is shown in the table below. The ordering cost is $6500 per order. The manufacturer incurs an annual inventory carrying rate of 20 percent. What is the optimal order quantity?       Quantity   Unit Price     q < 30000   $28     30000 = 40000   $22         2. [25 points] A retailer sells a particular type of desk. They currently have an inventory policy called "keep the average demand of eight weeks" in stock for this item. When the inventory drops to that level, order 600 units. The lead time has a normal distribution with mean of six weeks and variance of four weeks. The unit purchase cost of this item is $40. Fix ordering cost is $2000 and the annual inventory carrying rate is 20%. The weekly demand is normally distributed with mean of 60 units and variance of 225. Excess demand is fully backordered. The cost assessed for each back-ordered demand is $10 per unit. Assume there are 52 weeks in a year. ***For this question, when you read "z" from the z-chart, you must always pick the upper z-value. You should not interpolate or pick the lower z-value. I. [4 points] What is the total annual expected cost under the current policy? II. [2 points] What Type 2 service level is being achieved with the current policy? III. [14 points] The retailer wants to use the (q,r) policy model for this item. Determine the optimal order size and reorder level for this item. IV. [5 points] How much can the retailer save if it switches to the optimal policy?     3. [25 points] A company has three assembly plants located in Austin, Los Angeles, and San Francisco with daily production rate of 40, 40 and 80 units, respectively. Components A, B and C are used to make the final product at the assembly plants. One unit of component A, two units of component B, and two units of component C are used in each product. Components A, B and C are produced at manufacturing plants located in Macon and Nashville, and New Orleans, respectively. Currently the company uses trucks with a capacity of 8000 units and a cost of $12000 per trip to make full truckload milk-run deliveries to assembly plants. In other words, a truck picks up subassemblies first from Macon then from Nashville and then from New Orleans, and drops off first at Austin, then at Los Angeles and finally at San Francisco. Assume that it takes 2 days to drive from Macon to Nashville, 3 days from Nashville to New Orleans, 2 days from New Orleans to Austin, 3 days from Austin to Los Angeles, and 1 day from Los Angeles to San Francisco. The on-site inventory holding costs per component per day are $0.6, $0.8, and $1 for assembly plants in Austin, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, respectively. The in-transit inventory holding cost is $0.8 per component per day. Assume that there are 360 days in a year. I. [10 points] What are the annual total logistics (transportation, in-transit inventory, and on-site inventory) costs under the current policy? II. [15 points] a consultant suggested this company to open a warehouse in Atlanta to consolidate shipments and perform full cross-docking using trucks with a smaller capacity. Under the suggested policy, inbound shipments (components A, B and C) are directly shipped from manufacturing plants to the central warehouse in Atlanta using trucks with a capacity of 1000 components of each type and a cost of $300 per truckload. Assume that it takes 1 day to drive from each manufacturing plant to the central warehouse. For the outbound shipments (shipments from the central warehouse to the assembly plants) they use the optimal shipment quantities for a milk-run delivery scheme. A truck picks up components from the central warehouse, and drops off first at Austin, and then at Los Angeles and finally at San Francisco. Assume that it takes 1 day to drive from Atlanta to Austin. They use trucks that have a capacity of 3000 units of either component with the cost of $1500 per truckload for outbound shipments. Suppose that the company incurs an annual cost of M if it opens the central warehouse. For what values of M should the company use the suggested policy? Hint: To determine the optimal shipment quantities for a milk-run delivery scheme for outbound shipments, you should use the weighted average of on-site inventory costs (the weighted average of $0.6, $0.8, and $1) in your EOQ formula.       [30 points] The demand over a two-year period is shown as follows:        Quarter   2019   2020     1   212   301     2   250   422     3   118   183     4   176   219       I. [12 points] Forecast the demand for the four quarters of 2021 by seasonal decomposition using moving averages. Use a 5-period moving average technique for the de-seasonalized series. II. [12 points] Forecast the demand for the four quarters of 2021 using Winter's triple exponential smoothing method. Assume

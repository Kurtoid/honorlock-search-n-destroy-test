Let  be a length  sequence of positive integers. The maximum sum increasing subsequence of  is any increasing subsequence of  with the largest possible sum. Suppose you want to design a dynamic programming algorithm to find the sum of a maximum sum increasing subsequence of .While there may be many solutions to this problem, one of the recurrences on the list below would achieve a working algorithm. Select the correct recurrence relation. You do not need to explain your answer. Example:  Input:   Output: 18  (Since  is the maximum sum increasing subsequence, even though the longest increasing subsequence is  but this only sums to 15.)

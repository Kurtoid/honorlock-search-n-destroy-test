Question 9: A 40-year old chemist working at a Swiss pharmaceutical company described the following two experiences: "Last Friday, April 16, 1943, I was forced to stop my work in the laboratory in the middle of the afternoon and to go home, as I was seized by a peculiar restlessness associated with a sensation of mild dizziness. On arriving home, I lay down and sank into a kind of drunkenness, which was not unpleasant and which was characterized by extreme activity of imagination. As I lay in a dazed condition with my eyes closed (I experienced daylight as disagreeably bright) there surged upon me an uninterrupted stream of fantastic images of extraordinary plasticity and vividness and accompanied by an intense, kaleidoscope-like play of colors. This condition gradually passed off after about two hours." "I experimented on myself with the smallest dose of the substance that could be expected to have any effect. While my lab assistant and I were cycling home, it became clear that the symptoms were stronger than the first time. I had great difficulty in speaking coherently, my field of vision swayed before me, and objects appeared distorted like images in curved mirrors. I had the impression of being unable to move from the spot, although my assistant told me afterwards that we had cycled at a good pace. Once I was at home, the physician was called. By the time the doctor arrived, the peak of the crisis had already passed. As far as I could remember, the following were the most outstanding symptoms: vertigo; visual disturbances; the faces of those around me appeared as grotesque, colored masks; an intermittent heavy feeling in the head, limbs and the entire body, as if they were filled with lead; clear recognition of my condition, in which state I sometimes observed, in the manner of an independent, neutral observer, that I shouted half insanely or babbled incoherent words. Occasionally I felt as if I were out of my body." The doctor who examined him in both instances found pupillary dilation, tachycardia, sweating, blurred vision, tremors and incoordination. With which of the following substances was the author most likely intoxicated?

Read the passage, and then answer the question below. I looked upon the scene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain--upon bleak walls--upon the vacant eyelike windows--upon a few rank sedges--and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees--with an utter depression of soul, which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the afterdream of the reveler upon opium--the bitter lapse into everyday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil. Sedges: Grasslike plants --"The Fall of the House of Usher" by Edgar Allan Poe Question: According to the passage, which is the best description of the speaker's relationship to the house?
This 72-year-old female comes to the emergency department with inability to walk. She complains of low back pain that has been ongoing for years, but has recently become much more severe to the point today of not being able to walk. She is accompanied by her daughter, who provides further history of a CVA twelve months ago, with the patient still experiencing difficulty with attention and concentration as a result. Her mother has hypothyroidism after irradiation for thyroid cancer. Her diabetes, type 2, has been uncontrolled recently, and BGMs on admission was 398. This hyperglycemic condition will need brought under control and consult to neurosurgery regarding the patient's lumbar DDD. Neurosurgery determined that due the patient' multiple medical conditions it would be prudent to obtain glycemic control and then proceed to surgery for the back issues as it was apparent after testing that the patient was in need of a fusion. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Degenerative disk disease, L3-4, L4-5 OPERATION: Posterior lumbar interbody fusion, anterior column, L3-4 and L4-5, using nanoLock fusion devices and Danek pedicle screws with autogenous bone graft PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Patient was brought to the operating room and after induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, was placed in the prone -position on the spinal frame. Back prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A #18 gauge needle was used to identify the posterior spinous process of L3-4, IA-5 marked with Indigo Carmine stain and substantiated by x--ray. Just to the left of the midline, an incision was made and the incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and fascia. The tissues just under the skin were separated and the left and right lower back muscles were moved aside, exposing the back of the spinal column. Using the same lumbar incision, dissection of a suprafascial plane was made to identify the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS). Using an osteotome, the cortical bone of the PSIS was chipped off to expose the cancellous undersurface. A large bone gouge was utilized to harvest the cancellous bone from left iliac ere t. The bone was morselized and stored for use later in the procedure. The graft site was then irrigated with antibiotic irrigation and packed with Gelfoarn. The fascial opening was then closed. Larninectomy was then performed. The fusion was completed using the posterior lumbar interbody technique utilizing a nanoLock interbody fusion device. The L3-L4 level was addressed first. An alignment guide was placed over the L3-lA disk space and the disk was incised with a knife. A drill was used to make a bole into the disk space and spacers were put in sequentially up to a size #11. Cross-table lateral x-rays were taken of the lumbar spine. A C-ring retractor was placed over the spacer on the left side and the locking tube sleeve was inserted into the body of L3 and IA. The hole was drilled and loose fragments were moved with the straight pituitary. The nanoLock device was then selected and packed with bone graft obtained earlier from the iliac crest. The bone graft was packed into the device at the distal end and the device was inserted on the left side. The proximal end of the device was packed with bone. The same technique was completed on the right hand side. After completion of the procedure at the L3-L4 level, the same technique was done at the L4-L5 level. Because this was a two-level device procedure, the pedicle screw instrumentation was used to augment the stabilization. The pedicle screw was put into the L3 vertebral body by making a burr hole at the junction of the facet joint and transverse process on the left. The curette was used to make an entry hole into the pedicle and the screw was inserted. The same technique was done on the contralateral side and at the LS level bilaterally. The screw from L3-L5 was connected to the other L5 screw with a rod on both sides, and then the rods were locked into place with the locking nuts, and the rods were then connected with a transverse connector piece. Final x-rays were taken. The wound was then closed in anatomic layers using interrupted Vicryl suture for the deep layer and staples for the skin. Sterile dressing was applied and the patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

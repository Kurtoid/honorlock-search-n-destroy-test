What is the limiting reactant when 10.0 g of carbon monoxide (CO, molar mass = 28.01 g/mol) and 15.0 g of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, molar mass = 159.70 g/mol) are allowed to react completely to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and iron (Fe).                          Fe2O3(s) + 3CO(g) - 2Fe(s) + 3CO2(g)

QUESTION 8             A scientist investigates how the wavelength of sound waves in water varies with frequency. The table shows her data.             Right click on the button to open the table in a new window.                          8.1   Plot a graph of the results and draw a curve of best fit.   (5)                   8.2   Use your graph to find the frequency of sound waves that have a wavelength of 500 m in water.   (1)                   8.3   Describe the relationship between frequency of sound and wavelength.   (2)                   8.4   Suggest how the scientist could improve her results.   (1)                   8.5   Using the graph state the value for frequency at a wavelength of 2.5 Hz.    (1)                   8.6   Use the value obtained in 8.5 to determine the velocity of that wave.    (2)

Testing (cont.) Throat swabs were plated on culture media, including blood agar, chocolate agar, and Thayer-Martin agar. On the blood agar plate, a-hemolytic streptococci grew abundantly. An oxidase test was also performed on the culture of the Gram-negative diplococci on the chocolate agar plate.   Question This is a [positive] oxidase test, which means that the bacteria is a [respiration].

Write a C function with the following signature that gets three  input parameters: char* str, char** patterns and int n. The first parameter str is a char array that stores a string. The second parameter patterns is an array of strings (patterns) and the third parameter n is a positive integer specifying the length of the array passed as the second parameter of the function.  For every string pattern (stored in the array of patterns), your function must search for it in string str and remove all occurrences of it. The function finally must return the updated string str as its return value. Please note that the function should not modify the content of input parameters str and patterns while doing the mentioned task. Hint: you may use malloc function to allocate memory for storing the string that your function returns. Also, for the sake of simplicity, you can assume that the n patterns have no common prefix. Example: If the original string str contains "hello world", the array patterns contains "orl" and "ell", your function must return "ho wd". char* findAndRemove(char* str, char** patterns, int n){      ... }

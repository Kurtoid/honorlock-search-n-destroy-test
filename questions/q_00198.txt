True/False.  Enter T or F for statement.  (Do not enter the words "true" or "false".  Just the capital letter T or F)[1] Silicon atoms are covalently bonded to one another. [2] Doping increases the conductivity of silicon. [3] The width of the depletion region in a pn junction increases with reverse bias. [4] To produce power, a solar cell must be in forward bias. [5] LEDs emit light in equilibrium. [6] Zener diodes are useful for their forward-bias zeta voltages . [7] N-channel MOSFETS require negative VGS to turn on. [8] Large-amplitude ac input signals ensure linearization of an amplifier. [9] Thinking about Project 4 - Diodes, the measured reverse leakage currents for the various diodes reasonably matched the values reported in the respective datasheets. [10] Thinking about Project 5 - Diode Applications, the I-V curve of the infrared photodiode shifted upward (positive DC offset) when it was illuminated with infrared light.

In a classic study of sensory memory (Sperling, 1960), participants were able to remember a row of letters with about the same accuracy when the row was cued after the letters disappeared compared to when the row was cued before they disappeared. This study illustrated what about sensory memory?

A 4-year-old child, unvaccinated, is recovering from measles. Two days ago, he began  complaining of a stomach ache, and back pain. The child was given children's Tylenol for the fever and chills. A visit to the doctor revealed hemoglobinuria along with a decreased hemoglobin (6 g/dL) and increased reticulocyte count. A Donath- Landsteiner test was performed and showed the following. Control sample = no hemolysis at 4C or 37C, no hemolysis at biphasic temperature. Patient sample = no hemolysis at 4C or 37C, hemolysis at biphasic temperature. The results indicate:
Structure A is ____________________________.
In the question above, what fulfillment option is John using?

In an unstructured peer-to-peer network, if a peer wants to find a specific data item, the network has to be "flooded by the query" in order to find peers that host the data. However, flooding can cause a high amount of network traffic and hence such networks typically have very poor search efficiency. Can you explain at a high level (i.e. no need for equations) how a structured network, such as Chord system, overcomes this limitation (i.e. how a data item is assigned to a given node and how another node efficiently finds that item in response to a specific query)?

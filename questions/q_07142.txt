Application Question B: Excel functions Note: You will use cell references (relative, absolute, or mixed). Do not manually enter the number. You will be graded based on cell references, excel functions, and formulas. Project Description  You live in Lebanon, Kansas, which is the geographic center of the United States. You are looking for a college that will be near your home or near your relatives in Illinois. By doing a little research online at various websites, you have been able to obtain some information about the colleges in your area which you plan on using to rate the colleges and choose the best one for you.   Download and save the file below. QuestionB.xlsx   Steps to Perform: Step 1. (0.5 points) Save the file as QuestionB_FirstLast using your first and last name.  Step 2. (3 points)  On the SchoolData worksheet, using the cell range A13:Q54, create named ranges using the values in the top row (Row 13) for the range names.  Be familiar with the named ranges that come with the data and the named ranges you create in the step. You will use some of them later. Step 3. (4 points) In Cell M14, enter a function that uses the MilesGrade range from the Lists worksheet to return the Score based on the distance of the school from your home (Distance). Copy the formula down through Cell M54.  Step 4. (5 points) In Cell N14, enter a function that will return 6 points if the Fresh Satis (Freshman Satisfaction) and Grad Rate (Graduation Rate) are greater than 50%. If both conditions are not met, the college will only receive 1 point. Copy the formula down through Cell N54.  Step 5. (5 points) In Cell O14, enter a function that will return 6 points if the Size of the school (Size) is less than 2,000, and return 3 points if the school meets the financial needs of its students (Need Met) more than 50% of the time. If neither condition is met, the college will only earn 1 point. Copy the formula down through Cell O54.  Step 6. (9 points) In P14, enter a function that tests if the state is equal to KS.  If the college is in Kansas (KS), nest a VLOOKUP function that will return the Value from the COA (Cost of Attendance) range from the Lists worksheet based on the resident cost of attendance (Res COA) If the college is outside of Kansas, nest a VLOOKUP function that will return the value from the COA range from the Lists worksheet based on the non-resident cost of attendance (Non-Res COA).  If there is no cost of attendance in the schedule, the formula should return blank. Copy the formula down through Cell P54.  Step 7. (4 points) In Cell Q14, enter a function to total the number of points the school has earned (Columns M through P). Copy the formula down through Cell Q54.  Step 8. (4 points) In Cell B1, enter a function that will calculate the average resident cost of attendance for college located in the state of Kansas.  Step 9. (8 points)  In Cell B2, enter a formula that will count the number of schools in the state of Kansas that have a low cost of attendance. You decided that a low cost of attendance is any school that earned a 4 or 5 cost point value in Column P.  (Hint: You will need to add the count for colleges in the state that earned 4 points to the count of colleges in the state that earned 5 points.) Step 10. (3 points)  In Cell C7, enter a function based on the total points you calculated that will determine the maximum number of points that were earned for all schools.  Step 11. (9 points) In Cell C8, enter an INDEX and MATCH function to determine the name of the college that matches the number of points you found in Cell C7. To allow you to quickly change from the name of the college to any other attributes, you should use an INDIRECT function to the name in Cell B8.    Upload your QuestionB file (with answers) to this question.

Write a program that reads a list of integer values into a 1D Array and outputs those doubles in reverse. The input begins with an integer indicating the number of integers that follow. For coding simplicity, follow each integer that is output by a space, including the last one. Note that you have to declare the Array. Be sure to size the array so it contains the exact number of ints in the input. Ex: If the input is: 5 1 2 3 4 5 the output is: 5 4 3 2 1 Enter your program in the essay box that follows the below skeleton program  (the full program is fine). Below is a "starter" skeleton to help get you started. import java.util.Scanner;public class LabProgram { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in); int numElements; // Number of integers in user's list // Add more variables as needed numElements = scnr.nextInt(); // Input begins with number of integers that follow // Add statements as needed and good luck }}

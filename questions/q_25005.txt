Each block in a direct-mapped write-back cache with a snooping write-invalidate, cache coherence protocol has 3 states: invalid, shared, and exclusive.  When the source is processor, it means the request (cache result) came from the current processor (cache).  When the source is bus, it means that the request came from another processor (cache).  A read miss or write miss indicates that the cache block was accessed, but the correct memory block was not in the processor's cache.      Case Source Current State Request Action New State   1 processor invalid read miss place read miss on bus    2 processor invalid write miss place write miss on bus    3 processor shared read hit     4 processor shared read miss place read miss on bus    5 processor shared write hit place invalidate on bus    6 processor shared write miss place write miss on bus    7 processor exclusive read hit     8 processor exclusive write hit     9 processor exclusive read miss write back block    10 processor exclusive write miss write back block    11 bus shared read miss     12 bus shared write hit     13 bus shared write miss     14 bus exclusive read miss write back block    15 bus exclusive write miss write back block      Indicate the cache state transitions based on the information in the table above.  In other words, choose one of the three states (invalid, shared, or exclusive) that will be the new state of the processor's cache block for each case in the table.  You should do this by cutting and pasting the lines below and fill in an I (invalid), S (shared), or E (exclusive) to represent the new state for each case. 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.

Read about what happens when you drink a slurpee.  Then answer the questions that follow If you drink a large slurpee (a beverage high in glucose) the following events occur in this order . . . 1. Glucose is absorbed in the intestine and the level of glucose in blood rises. 2. In response to rising blood glucose levels, cells in the pancreas release insulin 3. Insulin facilitates the movement of glucose into body cells,  as a result, blood glucose levels fall 4. When blood glucose levels drop, the stimulus for insulin release disappears and insulin is no longer secreted Questions:  What type of feedback is occurring? [neg] What is the stimulus? [increaseglucose] What are the receptors?  [cellsinpancreas] What is the output? [insulin]

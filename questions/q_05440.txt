Consider the adiabatic compression of a gas from V1 and T1 to V2.  Assume that the compression is mechanically reversible, and that the heat capacities can be assumed constant.  Assume that internal energy is only a function of temperature.  Using the van der Waals equation of state with a = 0 (no attractive interactions), compute the final temperature T2.  Note: The van der Waals equation is P = RT/(V-b) - a/V2.

A local farm in Letterkenny Canada has decided to start a produce delivery service service where customers can order one of three assorted bags of produce. The Orange bags sell for $80; and their material costs are $25. The Blue bags sells for $75; their material costs are $40. Green Bags sell for $20; their variable material costs are $5. All bags are estimated to have a labor and deliver cost of $10.  Last year, the farm sold 5000 Orange bags , 2500 Blue bags, and 7,500  Green bags and they expect the same volume this year.  The farm has fixed costs of $12,500 per month.  Calculate the annual break-even point of the farm (Choose the nearest answer)      Product                                 Orange                                 Blue                                 Green
In Joyce Carol Oates' story, "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?" the narrator describes Connie as a fifteen-year-old who "had a quick, nervous giggling habit of craning her neck to glance into mirrors" (126).

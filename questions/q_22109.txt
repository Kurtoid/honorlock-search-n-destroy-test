You work at a steel mill designing their carburization process.  During carburization, steel is exposed to methane gas at high temperatures.  The carbon from the methane diffuses into the surface of the steel forming a "carburized" near-surface layer that is significantly harder than the original steel. At the carburization temperature of 600 degC, the diffusivity of carbon in steel is about 10 (microns)2/s.  If you are asked to diffuse the carbon 10 microns into the steel (i.e., form a 10 micron thick carburized layer), approximately how long should you expose the steel to this carburization process?

Let's say you wanted to understand the role of habitat loss versus fragmentation on the Florida scrub lizard in central Florida. To do so, you acquire a categorical map of scrub patches in the central Florida region. With this map, you randomly select scrub patches to survey (using pitfall traps) for the presence or absence of scrub lizards before and after some urban development occurs that causes a reduction in scrub habitat. You will need to interpret how variation landscape structure may influence the presence or absence of scrub lizards in the patches that you sampled. From a scale perspective, the extent of your analysis will be [options]
The following experiment is used for the following question.   A researcher discovered a species of moth that lays its eggs on oak trees. Eggs are laid at two distinct times of the year: early in spring when the oak trees are flowering and in midsummer when flowering is past. Caterpillars from eggs that hatch in spring feed on oak flowers and look like oak flowers, but caterpillars that hatch in summer feed on oak leaves and look like oak twigs.   How does the same population of moths produce such different-looking caterpillars on the same trees? To answer this question, the biologist caught many female moths from the same population and collected their eggs. He put at least one egg from each female into eight identical cups. The eggs hatched, and at least two larvae from each female were maintained in one of the four temperature and light conditions listed below.       Temperature   Day Length     Springlike   Springlike     Springlike   Summerlike     Summerlike   springlike     Summerlike   summerlike       In each of the four environments, one of the caterpillars was fed oak flowers, the other oak leaves. Thus, there were a total of eight treatment groups (4 environments x 2 diets).   In every case, caterpillars that feed on oak flowers look like oak flowers. In every case, caterpillars that were raised on oak leaves looked like twigs. These results support which of the following hypotheses?

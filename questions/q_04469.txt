Question 14: What would the optimal cycle length (Webster's formulation) and the corresponding effective green times for each phase be?   Optimal cycle length : [v1] s (rounding up to nearest 5 s) effective green time for Phase A: [v2] s (to nearest 0.1 s) effective green time for Phase B: [v3] s (to nearest 0.1 s)   effective green time for Phase C: [v4] s (to nearest 0.1 s) effective green time for Phase D: [v5] s (to nearest 0.1 s)
Use this scenario to answer the question. In a population of snails, there are both striped and unstriped.  The dominant allele (T) produces striped snails and the recessive allele (t) produces unstriped snails.  The allele frequency of the unstriped allele is 0.21.  What percentage of the population is has the TT genotype?
d. (16 pts): If the motor fails ( ), the elevator will start to fall. Fortunately, there are brakes to catch it! Suppose the elevator is falling at m/s when the brakes engage. The brake system is a frictional device with a static coefficient of friction
When planning care for a client in the latent phase of labor, what is the primary goal?
The patient will not leave home unless accompanied by a friend or relative. This patient's symptoms are typical of those with which of the following diagnosis?
Van is diagnosed with hypertension (high blood pressure). His doctor provides him with a variety of options for treatment. Which of the following would be suitable treatments for his hypertension.
Two cars, of equal mass, are moving on a highway.  Car B is moving twice as fast as Car A. Car A has ____________ kinetic energy as car B.
In a test cross for two characteristics (dihybrid cross), can the predicted frequency of recombinant offspring be 60%60%? Why or why not?
In the images below: Foal A is 5 weeks old with a mild to moderate left carpal valgus that has developed progressively despite corrective trimming.  Foal B is 9 months old with a moderate to severe right carpal valgus that has only had minimal corrective trimming.  Based on the deformity you see present, the patient, and the history, which set of recommendations would you propose to produce the best cosmetic result at least risk to the patient?
A random sample of n = 4 scores is selected from a population.  Which of the following distributions definitely will be normal?
Solve the problem. Round results to the nearest hundredth.The mean of a set of data is 4.11 and its standard deviation is 3.03. Find the z score for a value of 10.86.
Which of the following, when taken up by a cell, binds to a repressor so that the repressor no longer binds to the operator?
Which of the following describes a feature of a network-based firewall?    Is executed directly on the servers that need to be protected. Inspects traffic received by a specific host. Works with a single network interface. Inspects traffic as it flows between networks.
Fill in the blank with the appropriate choice.  Only the best answer will count as the correct answer.  Each answer is used only once 5. A comparison of types of play found in mammals by Robert Fagen with types of play described for Parakana children by Yumi Gosso shows that human children engage in new kinds of play (such as "symbolic play" and "______with rules") that are not found in other animals. These kinds of play are unique to our species.  6. At birth, about _________ of the energy metabolized by human infants is used by the brain while the remainder is used by the body. In adult humans, about 20% of available metabolic energy is used by the brain.  7. The process of creating connections between neurons is known as_________. It is completed earlier in the part of the brain responsible for vision and hearing.  It peaks later in the frontal lobes of the brain responsible for planning and thinking.  The process of creating connections among neurons of the frontal lobes continues in adults but at a much lower rate than in immature humans. 8. Using PET scans to measure glucose utilization, Chugani discovered that 3-year old humans have brains which are ______ as active as adults (they are building connections among neurons at ______ the rate of adults). Glucose utilization remains at this rate until children reach 10 years of age and only gradually changes to the adult level at about 18 years of age. [Note the same word is used in all blanks]. 9. Exuberant overconnectivity of neurons during childhood is accompanied by ________ of unused connections and strengthening of frequently used connections.  As described by Diamond and Hopson, this principle of brain circuitry construction is known as "use it or lose it."  10. When Byers saw that play rates in Norway rats, domestic cats and house mice peaked at the same time as terminal synapse formation peaked in the cerebellum, he suggested that the function of play was to shape _______ development. 11. To test the above hypothesis, Byers looked at play rates and brain size in marsupials. He found that play was common in the marsupial species with the ________ brains while it was absent in other marsupials.   12. An early analysis of emotional communication by Darwin emphasized that species-typical emotional expression has evolved in both humans and other animals. He published his findings in an 1872 book which showed pictures of human infants expressing grief using _____expression while emotions expressed by dogs showed minimal ______ expression but dramatic postural changes.    [Note that the same term is used in both blanks] 13. Paul MacLean described the evolutionary emergence of brain structures and emotions which support the mother-infant relationship as a "________revolution" which is found in mammals but not in reptiles.   14. John Bowlby suggested that an emotional-behavioral process he called _________keeps young children in proximity to their caretaker. He found that hospitalized children experienced (and communicated) extreme distress when separated from their parents even when their physical needs were met and hospital staff behaved in a kindly manner.  15. Bowlby proposed that hospitalized children who protest the departure of their parents are behaving appropriately given the dangers that ancient human children would have faced in the "environment of________ adaptedness" if they became separated from their parents. This is the environment that shaped human psychology over the "deep time"/evolutionary history of our species.

Intentional weight loss may be helpful or harmful, depending on the method used. Decreased fat stores are normally the goal and loss of muscle is never a concern as an undesirable side effect.

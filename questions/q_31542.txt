Shannon has created a model with six predictors (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 , x6). She has 80 observations. She found the following ANOVA table.      DF Sum of Squares Mean Sq F p-value   x1     0.002   x2     0.003   x3     0.004   x4   401  0.065   x5   300  0.26   x6   254  0.25   Residuals  [SSEfull]       She would like to remove the last two variables (x5, x6) all at one time, so she ran the model with only the first four variables  (x1, x2, x3, x4).      DF Sum of Squares Mean Sq F p-value   x1     0.001   x2     0.002   x3     0.75   x4        Residuals  [SSEr]       Find the F test statistic to determine if she can remove both variables.

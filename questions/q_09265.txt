Optical characterization of Semiconductors (20 points) (a) A semiconductor is illuminated with a red light with a wavelength of 633 nm. We observe some infrared light emission with a peak wavelength of 750 nm. What information about the emitted light can be used to determine if the light emitted is the Stokes line from Raman scattering or is actually photoluminescence? You could propose additional experiments to guide your determination; but if you do, please describe what experiments will be conducted and how results from such experiments will be used to make the determination. (10 points) (b) A particular semiconductor with a direct bandgap of 2.2 eV contains a certain type of point defects with a concentration of 10 ppm. These point defects have a Gaussian distribution in energy with the peak at 300 meV below the conduction band and a peak width of 100 meV.  Discuss how the presence of these point defects may impact the optical absorption and luminescence spectra (i.e. how the absorption and luminescence spectra of this defect-containing semiconductor may be different from those of the same semiconductor without these defects). (10 points)

In a particular plant, leaf color is controlled by gene locus D. Plants with at least one D allele have dark green leaves, and plants with the homozygous recessive dd genotype have light green leaves. A true-breeding dark-leaved plant is crossed with a light-leaved one, and the F1 offspring is allowed to self-pollinate.

Which of the boxes marked 1-4 correspond(s) to plants with dark leaves?

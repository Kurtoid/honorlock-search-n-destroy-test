Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs) can be vital in a health fitness club setting in order to save lives. One example of this is the survival rate from a cardiac event when an AED is utilized. If an AED is used within the first five (5) minutes of collapse, what is the estimated survival rate from a cardiac event?

You are exploring an opportunity to build a retail center in York, Pennsylvania. After performing the feasibility study you identify the following pertinent information. The retail center is 100,000 square feet in size. The center has an estimated total development cost of $22,500,000. Your market study projects annual NOI of $2,450,000. Based on your discussions with the lender you would be able to obtain a loan at 60% loan to cost with a 4.25% interest rate and a 30 year amortization.  What is your projected development yield on this project? (to 4 decimal places - for example: 1.25% would be answered 0.0125)

The research and development department of a well-known household products company is producing a new liquid soap that will clean an entire home with only one drop. They have discovered that the production of the soap has created a byproduct, Fluoro-X. The environmental and health effects of Fluoro-X are unknown, but the company decides to pre-treat the waste stream from the lab before pumping it to the treatment plant. Their laboratory studies reveal that Fluoro-X reacts with chlorine gas, Cl2: Fluoro-X + Cl2 --> products The rate law for this reaction is d[Fluoro-X]/dt = -0.85/s*[Fluoro-X] To treat the waste stream containing Fluoro-X, a 50-L CSTR is designed that will supply Cl2 into the reactor. The Cl2 is pumped into the reactor at a rate of 2 L/s and is free of Fluoro-X. The flow rate of the Fluoro-X stream is 7.5 L/s and the concentration is 3.5 mg/L. The outlet from the CSTR is then sent to the sewage pipes. Draw the control volume. At steady-state, what removal percentage is achieved in this process?
What is the common name for this organism?
It's important to understand the difference between a "fact" and an "opinion". An "opinion" is an idea that you believe is true but can be argued while a "fact" is an idea that is absolutely true and cannot be argued.

OFFIT is a company that sells protein powder for nutritional shakes. The company is considering a new project that would develop a new ketogenic blend that is low in sugars. The company hasestimated that this new product's NPV is $2 million, but this estimate is based upon sales of the new product alone. As OFFIT's chief economist, you recognize that some of those sales will come at the expense of the existing non-ketogenic blend that the firm sells. You run some focus groups and online trials to generate data, which lead you to estimate that if OFFIT starts selling the new ketogenic blend the company will lose $300,000 in after-tax cash flows during each of the next 10 years because of reduced sales of the existing product. If OFFIT's preferred discount rate/cost of capital is 10 percent, what is the estimated net present value (NPV) of selling the new ketogenic blend after accounting for the negative externalities? Round your answer to the nearest dollar, i.e. -34,984. Do not include a dollar sign ($) in your response.

Since its removal from the banned substances list in 2004 by the World Anti-Doping Agency, caffeine has been used by athletes with the expectancy that it enhances their workout and performance.  Researchers at the University of Western Australia conducted a test in which they determined the rate of energy expenditure (in kJ) on 10 healthy, sedentary females who were nonregular caffeine users.  Each female was randomly assigned to either a placebo or caffeine pill (6mg/kg) 60 minutes prior to exercise.  The subject rode an exercise bicycle for 15 minutes at 65% of their maximum heart rate, and the energy expenditure was measured.  The process was repeated on a separate day for the remaining treatment.  The mean difference in energy expenditure (caffeine-placebo) was 18kJ with a standard deviation of 19kJ.  Assuming the differences are normally distributed, determine if caffeine appears to increase energy expenditure at the

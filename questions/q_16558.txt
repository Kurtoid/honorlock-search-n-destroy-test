Fleur pointed out that there were a lot of things that could be causing her symptoms and they had to keep an open mind. She wanted first to update Grandma Rose on what was known about the digestive process, and then start asking her other questions. Please answer either this question 26a with drop-down answers or the next question 26b, but do not answer both. Only one of the two questions will be graded.  In the early stages of the digestive process, acetylcholine released by the vagus nerve, stimulates the [answer1] to release gastrin, which then stimulates the enterochromaffin-like cell to produce [answer2], which stimulates the [answer3] to produce HCl. The secretion of H+ to the gastric lumen involves the movement of intracellular vesicles containing the enzyme [answer4] to the surface to fuse with the apical plasma membrane. The lower pH causes [answer5] from the Chief cell to convert to its active form [answer6]. The lower gastric pH also stimulates the D cells to produce [answer7] which inhibits gastrin release and enacts a regulatory control of the process. When the acidic chyme enters the small intestine, the lower pH (~pH 4) stimulates mucosal cells to produce [answer8] which inhibits gastrin release and also stimulates the pancreas to release [answer9] and [answer10] into the pancreatic duct, thus facilitating the movement of zymogens. Pancreatic acinar cells are signaled to release zymogen granules by the duodenal peptide hormone [answer11], which also stimulates the [answer12] to release bile.  Because of the secretions from the pancreatic duct, the pH in the duodenum is [answer13], thereby facilitating the processing of zymogens such as proelastase or procarboxypeptidase by the enzyme [answer14] to their active forms in the duodenum.

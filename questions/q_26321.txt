Questions (21)-(23) concern the following thought experiment, discussed by Parfit.  The brain of one person, A, is divided and transplanted into the bodies of two others.  The resulting people X and Y are perfectly psychologically continuous with A.  Who is A, after the operation?  There are, it seems, three answers: (i) A is neither X nor Y; (ii) A is either X or Y (but not both), and (iii) A is both X and Y.  Each possibility seems problematic. (iii) seems problematic for the following reason:

A baby is born to a young Chinese couple in Beijing, China.  At the age of one month the child is taken from the Chinese couple and given to a young Mexican couple in  a small village in Mexico to raise. Neither his Mexican parents nor anyone else in the village knew anything of the Chinese culture or the Chinese language.  Even so by the time he was ten he was fluent in both Spanish  and Chinese, although he had never heard the Chinese language spoken.   There were many other ways in which he was "Chinese" like - he knew how and preferred to eat with chop-sticks for instance.  Fascinating to his Mexican parents and others who knew him because there was no way that he could have been taught those things growing up.   If you had to say, based on the limited information I have given you, would you say that this story is most likely true or very probably false.

Recent studies have demonstrated that daily exposure to full-spectrum light (phototherapy) is most effective in improving symptoms in people who are experiencing:
A researcher wants to better understand the well-established link between clients' pre-treatment expectations that psychotherapy will be beneficial ("expectations for change") and their progress in therapy ("therapy outcome"). She anticipates that "engagement in therapy" will explain at least part (if not all) of the relationship between pre-treatment expectations and therapy outcome. The researcher is interested in understanding this link for all adult outpatient psychotherapy clients but has easy access to the university counseling center (UCC) at her institution. Her procedure submitted to the Institutional Review Board is: As new UCC clients enter treatment, they are invited by the intake counselor to participate in the study and they go through an informed consent process. The researcher will be the intake counselor for some of these appointments because she is a counselor at the center. She will, therefore, also provide the therapy to some of the clients in the study. To track clients over time, they will be asked to put their student ID number on both the Time 1 and Time 2 forms.   Because the researcher wants to reduce the amount of time burden on participants, participants will only complete measures at two time points. At Time 1 (at intake) they will complete a detailed demographic questionnaire and a brief homegrown scale the researcher believes captures the "expectations for change" variable. This measure includes three items measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) scale: "I want to get better," "I know what it will take to improve my presenting concerns," and "I have the social support needed to change." At Time 2 (immediately after the final therapy session, administered by the treating therapist), they will complete the 34-item Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE) scale, which is a well-established measure of psychological distress and is designed to measure the "therapy outcome" variable. They will also complete a single-item measure of "engagement in therapy": "How engaged were you throughout this therapy process?" (0 = not at all, 10 = extremely). The researcher will use this data to answer the research question: does engagement in therapy explain part of the relationship between expectations for change and therapy outcome?    This is a study examining a mediation effect. Identify the independent (predictor) variable, mediator variable, and dependent (outcome) variable. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of how each of these variables was operationalized, as well as how the operationalization and data collection procedures affect the construct validity of the study. Discuss the strengths and limitations of this study with regard to internal validity, external validity, and data evaluation (statistical) validity. Based on the limitations you identify and without switching to an experimental design, offer suggestions for how to improve the validity of the study. Imagine that you are the IRB reviewer for this study. What ethical concerns do you have about the study as proposed? What suggestions do you have to limit the risks associated with this study?

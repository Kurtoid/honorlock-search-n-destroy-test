El queso manchego es un producto unico que tenemos en Espana que es lo mejor de la gastronomia. Es un producto que deriva de la leche de un tipo de oveja (sheep) que se llama <<oveja manchega>>. Esas ovejas viven en zonas aridas del pais y comen paja (hay). Los que trabajan en eso ordenan (they milk) las ovejas y luego, despues de un largo proceso de elaboracion, se forma el queso en un molde.

Did you show a 360 degree view of your room AND show your desktop during the room scan?  If not, do it NOW! Maximize the testing window!  You should not see anything on the computer except the test and testing materials.  Please take a moment, before you start the test, and show your webcam that both sides of each sheet of scratch paper are blank, even if you showed it during your environment video.  Once this is complete, please click on the Chapter 3 Formula sheet link BELOW and give a thumbs up to the camera that the link opened.  Please keep the tab open through the entire test (don't "x" out of it), it saves time.  To get back and forth between the formula sheet and the test, hold the Alt button while tapping the tab button. If the link doesn't open immediately, please try to open it again.  If the link does not open properly, please submit the test immediately and contact Mrs. Conderman (do NOT look at or work on the test).  This is unlikely, but it would fall under "technical difficulties" and you will not be penalized for following these directions. Thank you!

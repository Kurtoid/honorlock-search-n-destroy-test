This question refers to the essential steps in meiosis described below.   formation of four new nuclei, each with half of the chromosomes present in the parental nucleus  alignment of tetrads at the metaphase plate  separation of sister chromatids(dyads)  separation of the homologs; no uncoupling of the centromere  synaspis; chromosomes moving to the middle of the cell in pairs    From the description above, which of the following is the order that most logically illustrates a sequence of meiosis?
Nuclear proteins A and B were identified as components of multiprotein complex biochemically purified from human cell line HeLa. Consequent studies revealed that endogenous proteins A and B co-localize in nucleus of HeLa cells and also interact in vivo by FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) in these cells. Surprisingly, same two proteins do not interact in in vitro pull-down assay when purified as recombinant proteins from E. coli.   Q9A (5 points): Suggest potential explanation(s) of difference between in vivo and in vitro results.     Q9B (5 points): Design experiment(s) to prove your model.

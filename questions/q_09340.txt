(Matching) Mode of thermal transfer for hot packs
Suppose S is an arbitrary static analysis and D is an arbitrary dynamic analysis for finding divide-by-zero errors. Further, suppose S is sound and incomplete, whereas D is complete but unsound. Also, suppose both S and D always terminate. Let P1, P2, and P3 be the following programs. All errors referred to below are divide-by-zero errors: P1 contains an errorP2 does not contain an errorP3 is unknown if it contains an error Which of the following statements are True? Complete the following tables.    Program Analysis S Analysis D   P1 [P1-S] report an error [P1-D] report an error   P2 [P2-S] report an error [P2-D] report an error   P3 [P3-S] report an error [P3-D] report an error         Program If S Reports an Error, D If D Reports an Error, S   P3 [P3-SD] report an error [P1-DS] report an error

A survey was done at Center Hospital to determine how long (in months) nurses had been in their current positions. The responses of 20 nurses are shown below. 23      2       5      14      25      34      27      32      12      8 7      23    29      26      28      11      20      33        8    35 Use the Outlier Rule of Thumb to determine the upper and lower fences for the data, then determine if there are any outliers. The upper fence is [upperfence].  The lower fence is [lowerfence].  There are [outliers] outliers.

A three phase synchronous generator rated 230 V (line-to-line), 60 Hz, has a synchronous reactance of   3  per phase.  Assume that the stator resistance is negligibly small.  An open circuit test on the machine showed that the stator voltage of the generator was equal to the rated voltage with a field current of 5 A.  Assume that the generator is magnetically linear (no saturation). Suppose that the generator is driven by a diesel engine (this is typical of a backup power supply in a hospital, for instance), and the speed of the engine and generator is known to be 1800 rpm, which is the synchronous speed.  For the remainder of this entire problem, the stator of the generator is connected to a power system which can be considered to be balanced three phase, 230 V(line-line), 60 Hz voltage source.  Suppose that the torque supplied by the diesel engine is 75 Nm, and the field current is adjusted to 6 A.  How many magnetic poles does the generator have? Find the power angle, d. Find the real power produced by the generator.

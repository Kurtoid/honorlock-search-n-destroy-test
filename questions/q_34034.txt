The manager was not encouraged by the results and is considering two options and asks you for your opinion regarding each option:  Option A: Shut down the business and find a buyer; or  Option B: Sell 200 more pizzas the next day since Average Variable Costs would only increase to $8.70 which he thinks would improve their financial position. What would you recommend Chef's Pizza manager regarding each of the two options: A & B? Use the numbers provided to support your answer.

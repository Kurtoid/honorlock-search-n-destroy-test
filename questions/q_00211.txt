For each of the three following situations, compare the likely daily gain per animal response for cattle on a basal diet (forage alone) versus a supplemented diet at the type of stocking rate indicated. Explain why you think this is true. Situation #1. One-half of a group of cattle grazing limpograss with crude protein concentration of 4% receives no supplement. The other half are grazing the same limpograss and receiving a non-protein nitrogen supplement. Compare gain per animal for unsupplemented versus supplemented animals if they were stocked at a low stocking rate. Indicate why it is this way. Compare gain per animal for unsupplemented versus supplemented animals if they were stocked at a high stocking rate. Indicate why it is this way.   Situation 2. One-half of a group of cattle are grazing annual ryegrass (75% digestible and 18% crude protein) as the basal diet and receiving no supplement. The other half are grazing the same forage but receiving 3 lb of ground corn per head per day.  Compare gain per animal for unsupplemented versus supplemented animals if they were stocked at a low stocking rate. Indicate why it is this way. Compare gain per animal for unsupplemented versus supplemented animals if they were stocked at a high stocking rate. Indicate why it is this way.   Situation 3. Cattle are grazing bahiagrass (50% digestible and 10% crude protein) and one-half receive only bahiagrass. The other half are grazing the same forage but also receiving 3 lb of ground corn per head per day. Compare gain per animal for unsupplemented versus supplemented animals if they were stocked at a low stocking rate. Indicate why it is this way. Compare gain per animal for unsupplemented versus supplemented animals if they were stocked at a high stocking rate. Indicate why it is this way.

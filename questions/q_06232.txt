Use the following scenario to answer the following questions:   A professor wants to perform an experiment to test which resources would be best for students to pass her exams. She is currently in the classroom and she sends half her class to study in the library and the other half must stay in the classroom. Both groups of students have access to any available resources within their location of study. To test which group of students does better, the students at the library return to the classroom and students play team Kahoot where each group competes to get the correct answer and the fastest. Points are awarded based on correct answers and speed of the correct answer. No points are rewarded for wrong answers. Professor Archer predicts the library students will score better on the kahoot than the students who stayed in the classroom. The actual experiment was performed: Team library: 8/10 42048 points Team classroom: 10/10  53073 points Note that the students in team classroom found and looked at the answers to the kahoot test, although team library was unaware. Professor Archer ruled that because the answer key was in the classroom it counted as any available resources in the classroom.

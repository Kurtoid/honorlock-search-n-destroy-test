Recently, our program has demonstrated that the scalloped hammerhead shark uses the Tolomato River, a portion of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway between Ponte Vedra and St. Augustine, as a nursery habitat. We determined this by showing that the abundance of newborn scalloped hammerheads is more abundant in this system than in other northeast Florida estuaries. We also determined that these animals are not born in the estuary; they are more likely born outside of the estuary and move into it 1-2 weeks after birth. Last, we also have demonstrated that these animals do not appear to come back to this habitat over multiple years; close to 100% of the scalloped hammerheads that we have caught in this site have been newborn animals. However, it is of course possible that after they "grow up," females may have offspring that also use this system as a nursery. We are curious about the factors that could influence the use of this system as a nursery. a) Using your knowledge, describe whether you believe this behavior is: -fixed action pattern (FAP) or -a function of imprinting or -a function of associative learning. As part of your answer, you should define what each of these terms refer to.   b) In addition to the factors that drive this behavior, we are also curious about how these animals "know" how to find the Tolomato River system. That is, what are the factors that regulate use of this habitat?  Briefly describe an approach that we could use to we could investigate this question.

On the Excel spreadsheet, there are two matrices (Matrix A and Matrix B) highlighted in yellow on the "Exam2-Q51" tab). Complete the following matrix operations: (1) Calculate [C]=[A]*[B] using "MMULT" function in the designated blue area; (2) Calculate the Determinant of Matrix A using "MDETERM" function in the designated blue area; (3) Get the transpose of Matrix A using a VBA program; (4) On the "Exam2-Q52" tab, calculate [C]=[A]*[B] using a VBA program.   You will need to use "option base 1" in matrix or array VBA programs. The algorithm for the transpose of a matrix [A] is: Transpose matrix AT (j,i) = A (i,j)   The algorithm for matrix multiplication is: For i = 1 to (number)             For j = 1 to (number)                         For k = 1 to (number)                                  C (i,j) = C (i,j) + A (i,k)* B (k,j)                         Next k             Next j Next i Note: The first two sub-questions, (1) and (2), are Excel spreadsheet problems, and no programming is required. The code/formulas should be written such that values in blue change correctly if the values in yellow change and the code is re-executed. Once complete, please type a one-word essay (e.g., "ok") for this question and then upload your combined Excel file at the very end of this exam.

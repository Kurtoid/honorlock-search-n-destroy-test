Failure to underline & label all goal components will result in grade of a 1.   See the below example.  LTG:   xxxxxxxxxx (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX (O) XXXXXXXXXX (A) xxxxxxxxxxxxxx (S) XXXXXXXX (T). LTG Rationale:   write 1 brief sentence stating your rational for this goal, for the given pt.   Example Case information-a client s/p (status post) CABG demonstrates Poor activity tolerance, which negatively impacts showering.

Make sure to submit it to the Retake Exam 3 - Written Portion assignment - you don't want your work to be given a zero because you put it in the wrong place! If you find that you are taking much longer than 10 minutes to do so, please log into zoom, where I will be (the zoom link is in the instructions of this test).

Stimuli are changes inside or outside the body that can be detected by sensory receptors.
You wish to study the effects of temperature on crystallization growth rate. For this experiment, you alter the temperature and measure the change in crystal growth, while making sure the protein concentration is constant in each sample. Which is the dependent variable?
How many moles of Potassium permanganate are in 193 g of the compound.

The nurse enters the room of a patient who is complaining of feeling very anxious.  The patient is lying supine in bed, breathing rapidly, and complaining of shortness of breath. The nurse places the patient in a high-fowler's position.  What should the nurse do next?
In the exercise below, the initial substitution of x = a yields the form .  Look for ways to simplify the function algebraically, or use a table, and/or a graph to determine the limit.
Using the the scientific calculator on honorlock perform the following calculation: 2.50x10^15/1.67x10^2 In this class you may see this same problem written out in this form: 2.50E15/1.67E2 where E means times 10 raised to the following power If you did the problem correctly you should get 1.50E13 (Rounded).  You will need to use the EE button on the honorlock calculator to input the syntax. For example, the number 6.022x10^23 would be 6.022(press EE button)23 If you got the answer correct mark true. If you got the answer wrong keep practicing until you do. You may need this skill for your exams!
A complete list of current dimensioning variables and settings is displayed when which of the following is typed at the Dim: prompt?
Problem 4c) FSM combinatorial part ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner. The tool bar has indent functions.  In problem 4c) write the Combinatorial code for this FSM using the state transition table defined below continuing the code from 4a) and 4b) but do it using instantiations of the Mux you wrote in problem 1. A state transition table (which contains the same information as a state diagram) is supplied, below. Refer to it and instantiate  a 4:1 multiplexer from problem 1 caseMUX41 for nextstate, and another one for Z. For maximum credit your code should carefully follow the specification, and your grade will depend that. Use the minimum number of lines to accomplish this specification. Use System Verilog, always_ff, and always_comb, and don't use reg datatype. Also use proper indentation for organization.   ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate

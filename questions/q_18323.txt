She noticed that the scores were far higher than usual, probably because people were experiencing heightened anxiety as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. All participants received the therapy, which ended in June of 2021, just as a vaccine was being introduced and life was beginning to return to "normal." At the study's conclusion, Dr. Cooke found that scores on the posttest were considerably lower than scores on the pretest.

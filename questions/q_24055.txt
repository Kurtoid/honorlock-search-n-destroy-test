Bonus Question: A bonus question has been provided for each exam, adding 6 points to your overall score (3 midterms that count toward final grade). Despite these extra points, sometimes a small number of students approach the professor after receiving their final exam score to ask for points they did not earn to "bump" their grade. To receive the final 2 bonus points, please select just one of the following answers - any one of which will cause the final 2 bonus points to be added to your overall score, bringing the total up to 8 bonus points for the course. If no response is logged for this question, the final 2 bonus points will not be added to your point total.  This does not mean that if there were legitimate problems with questions on this exam that students shouldn't inform the instructor and seek rectification. If a question on this exam was problematic, the instructor will evaluate this and make alterations as has been the case for the mid terms.  Note that no bonus points will be reflected within individual exam scores, but are rather added by Dr. Bushman when calculating final grades.

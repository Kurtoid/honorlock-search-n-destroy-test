Q4a. (30 points). Supplementary cementitious materials (SCM's) are routinely used to replace cement in concrete. That being the case, describe the physical (e.g. particle size, texture) and chemical (e.g. oxides, reactivity, solubility....) properties of fly ash, slag cement, and silica fume relative to a typical ASTM C150 Type I portland cement and how these properties could be expected to affect properties of a concrete mix.   Q4b. (30 points). Benchmark (or compare/contrast) portland-limestone cement (PLC) as specified by ASTM C 595 Type IL to portland cement as specified by ASTM C 150 Type I. In this exercise, consider a range of factors such as manufacturing, environmental impact, fresh concrete properties, setting tendencies, and hardened mechanical and durability properties and explain how the properties of each cement impact these factors.

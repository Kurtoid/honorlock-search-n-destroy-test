Sulfa drugs like Bactrim, given for bacterial infections, inhibit bacteria by blocking folic acid synthesis.  The precursor molecule of folic acid is para-amino benzoic acid (PABA).  Interestingly, PABA has a structure very similar to Bactrim.  If Bactrim is present in greater quantities than PABA, the bacterial enzyme will bind to it (through its active site) because of the structural similarity between each.  This  is how the enzyme will be prevented from synthesizing essential folic acid in bacteria. This is an example of:

Some police officers went to an auto body shop with a search warrant to look for evidence supporting a tip that the shop owner was part of a stolen car "chop shop" ring and that he accepted stolen cars and resold the parts. While officers were talking to the owner in the shop's office, a woman pulled her car into the shop's garage, where a plain clothed police officer was examining some parts. The woman told the officer, "I need to have my car repaired and repainted right away because I just hit a kid on a bike and the cops will be looking for cars like mine in no time." Shortly before the woman had entered the garage, the officer had heard over his radio about a hit and run accident involving a child on a bike. The car that the police were looking for was the color and model of the woman's car, and the damage to the car seemed likely to be from that type of accident. The officer identified himself as a police officer and placed the woman under arrest. He performed a quick patdown of the woman's outer clothing and looked into the large purse she was carrying. In her purse, the officer found a package that appeared to be (and later proved to be) cocaine. In addition to charges related to the hit and run, the woman was charged with possession of cocaine. At trial, the woman's attorney moved to have the cocaine excluded from evidence. How should the court rule?

A 1.00-kg hollow cylinder of inner radius R1=10.0 cm and outer radius R2=30.0 cm is attached to a frictionless axis with four very light spikes as shown in the figure above. The cylinder is spinning with an angular velocity 6.00 rad/s in the direction shown. A small piece of clay with mass m=100 g is thrown toward the cylinder with velocity v=5.00 m/s; it hits the cylinder at a distance d=20.0 cm from its center at an angle theta of 70.0 o with respect to the radial line.  The clay sticks to the cylinder. a)(3p) Find the angular momentum of the cylinder before the clay hits it. Show work and remember to specify the units. b)(3p) Find the angular momentum of the clay with respect to the axis of rotation of the cylinder before the clay hits the cylinder. Show work and remember to specify the units. c) (1p) Is angular momentum of the cylinder-clay system is conserved during the collision? (yes or no) d) (1p) Is linear momentum of the cylinder-clay system is conserved during the collision? (yes or no) e) (7p) Find the angular speed of the cylinder after the clay hits it and sticks to it. Show work and remember to specify the units in your final answer. f) (5p) Find the amount of kinetic energy of clay-cylinder system lost in this collision. Show work and remember to specify units in your final answer.

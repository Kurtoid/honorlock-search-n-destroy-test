Since DNA is a double stranded molecule, the first event that has to happen is that the double helix has to open up.  The enzyme that does this is called [1].  When the molecule is opened up, it is unstable, so the single stranded bubble has to be held open with proteins that are called [2]  The unwinding of DNA increases the tension in the DNA molecule away from the origin of replication, like an elastic band being wound tightly.  To get rid of this tension, an enzyme called [3] cuts the DNA phosphodiester strands, releases the tension and then reseals the cut ends.  No DNA has been synthesized yet. The enzyme that is responsible for DNA synthesis, which is called [4] makes new DNA by adding nucleotides to the [5] end of a primer.  This enzyme must have a primer to work.  An enzyme called [6] is used to synthesize a primer that is made of [7]  and is the reverse complement of a region of DNA where DNA synthesis starts, called the [8]  Once the primer is made, nucleotides can be added using the sequence of the DNA strand as a [9]  Since both strands of DNA must be synthesized, you must have a primer complementary to each strand.  The enzyme continues to make new DNA in a [10] to [11] direction.  As the replication fork continues to grow, new DNA is continuously generated.  However, there is a problem with synthesizing what is called the lagging strand.  That problem is that there is no free [12] end to add nucleotides onto.  This problem is overcome using what are called [13] fragments.  The lagging strand is made in stages, and that is why they take longer (and why they are called lagging strands). At this stage a hybrid molecule exists:  a template strand made of DNA, and a newly synthesized strand that had primers made of RNA and sequences made of DNA.  Since we want to make DNA, not DNA/RNA, we must get rid of the RNA.  This is done using the enzyme [14] which removes the RNA and replaces it with DNA.  The final step is to seal the parts of the molecule where the RNA was replaced, and this is done by the enzyme [15]

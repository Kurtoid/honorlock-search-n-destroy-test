Large  state universities might be a place where fewer members of a student's time-tested support network are to be found, compared to if that student had enrolled in the local community college.            It's America, and people here think big. It's a cultural assumption to simply think that bigger is better, but is that always the case? Sixty-eight ounces of Coco-Cola with that combo meal is really better than twelve? Perhaps super-sizing it is not always the best way. Obese people up or down the road can expect to develop serious health issues. Larger vehicles typically incur greater operating costs for fuel, tires and insurance. A bigger house draws more funds out of the bank account to heat it in the winter and cool it in the summer compared to a more affordable and modest dwelling. Big cities have greater problems with traffic and crime. Perhaps the job with the smaller company would offer more opportunities and a greater chance to make a cubicle dweller's brilliance stand out all the brighter. Americans would do well to reconsider other situations in which bigger is automatically assumed by many to be better. For example, when graduating from high school and planning a career, is it really such a no-brainer starting out at a massive state university over the little by comparison, almost anonymous local community college? For many students who are new to higher education and who aren't getting a free four-ride, contrasting attending a large university with attending a community college can lead to seeing tangible advantages of starting out at the humble community college. Indeed, there are significant differences between starting the higher education journey at a community college and beginning at a large state university, and those include cost considerations, the quality of the learning atmosphere, and having more immediate access to a valuable personal support network.      To begin, the most obvious point of contrast between starting higher education at a state university and a community college involves the costs. For example, in 2016 the typical cost of a year at San Diego State University, just looking at the tuition costs, is approximately $7,000 (www.sdsu.edu), and that doesn't include the mandatory fee of $752. By great contrast, full-time tuition per annum at Imperial Valley College is under $1,500 (www.imperial.edu), and the fees are minuscule compared to SDSU's. For those whose robotic knee jerk reaction is bigger is better, exactly how is being buried in massive debt upon graduating a better situation when a young recent college graduate is likely already burdened enough with the challenges of starting a new independent life? No wonder why the average student debt from college loans is now $35,000, according to www.studentloanhero.com. By great contrast, if a student were to start at a community college and transfer after two years, many thousands of dollars would be saved-- even possibly tens of thousands of dollars. Beyond that, savings can be positively monumental when looking at how many students attend a university to which they cannot commute daily, and this can add another eight to twelve thousand dollars in debt per academic year by adding expensive housing costs.      Next, the learning atmosphere at a huge state college often markedly contrasts with that of a community college. Countless excited freshman, initially thrilled to be on such a huge campus, soon find they are not big men on campus but invisible person on huge campus. If that doesn't compute during walking 30 minutes or more through a sea of humanity on the way across campus to class from the parking lot so distant that it seems it might be in another county, then the realization certainly dawns when excitedly throwing open the classroom doors on the first day of classes only to find a crammed theater with hundreds of classmates in the same class section-- students who also can't believe that what they were warned would happen is actually indeed being manifested before their eyes and will continue to occur every day of the 16-week semester. Finding out during the first five minutes of class that a real professor is not teaching the class, but a teaching assistant who is also a student is manning the chalkboard, serves as foot stomp on the already not simply burst but shredded balloon set ablaze. How is someone going to learn in an atmosphere like that? By stark contrast, most classes at a community college are considered full at approximately thirty students per section, and students won't need to stand up and speak into an auditorium microphone squealing with feedback in order to ask a question of the student-masquerading-as-instructor. As a matter of fact very likely your community college has substantial teaching experience at one or more of those very same mega-universities. One of many factors linked to student success is the ratio of faculty to students (http://nces.ed.gov/npec/pdf/kuh_team_report.pdf). At a ratio of 1:30, instead of perhaps 1:600, community colleges once again hold the less-is-more edge. On their websites, universities used to brag about many tens of thousands of books they had in their libraries. Now with vast bulk of research materials now living on line, that size issue is an utter non-factor. And at a community college, during that one or two minute walk from the parking lot to classes, rather than feeling stressed and invisible, new students probably will feel more relaxed and comfortable talking to people. Making friendships that can evolve into lasting relationships occurs more readily in smaller, less stressful environments and can more easily happen among the less populated classrooms, too.      Finally, large state universities might be a place where fewer members of a student's time-tested support network are to be found, compared to if that student had enrolled in the local community college. As high school adolescents transition into young adulthood, they face issues they have never encountered before as they start living increasingly independent lives. True, there are Facebook and Skype to make connections with high school friends and family in order to keep in touch, but it is not the same as being in their presence. And sometimes it's when we are far from home when a serious problem arises, like the flat tire on the freeway in a city where no one knows you or suddenly finding the bank account is barren. Quite differently, attending community college the first few years in the cozy familiarity of one's comfort zone, with family and friends cheering from the sidelines and then at the gymnasium at graduation, can provide a psychological backdrop of security, helping students to focus on their studies. Many students needlessly suffer their first year of studies far away from home in an unfamiliar setting, feeling tremendous isolation. That cannot be productive to achieving a high grade point average. Getting a bachelor's degree takes most full-time students four or five years, and often they get derailed in the first semester or two, especially when far from home. If students would think about putting themselves in the very best position to succeed right out of the gate on Day One at college, keeping their support network close at hand, made all the easier by beginning the college experience at a local community college, can pay huge dividends.      To conclude, when considering the costs of higher education, the educational atmosphere, and the value of keeping one's support network close, attending a large state university or a communication college at the start could not be more different choices. It is somewhat ironic that some students who start at the local college do so by necessity, envious of their university-attending former high school classmates, hardly realizing how fortunate they actually are. Many thousands of dollars can easily be saved over the first two years before transferring (if that is the goal), a better educational experience can be acquired in those 100 and 101 level courses, and the benefits of a personal, local support network can be enjoyed by starting out at the local community college. So the next time someone tries to tell you that bigger is better, below that bulky and glittery surface a contrary and valuable alternatively may be hiding.

Several physicians have reported that patients who consume apple cider vinegar appear to have lower levels of LDL ("bad" cholesterol) than those who do not. As a result of this observation, researchers decide to they enlist 500 participants, all of which were 65 years of age. Of these participants, 250 are given a specific brand of apple cider vinegar and asked to consume 25mL every day. The other participants are asked to not consume any apple cider vinegar. All participants are asked to follow the same diet. After 6 months, researchers measure the participants' LDL levels.

ASU scientists use the Rutherford Backscattering Facility to determine the atomic composition of materials. In this facility, He atom ions (mass of 4 amu) are accelerated to high kinetic energies and strike a target. A fraction of the He atoms bounce back, reversing their direction of motion by 180deg. This occurs when the He ions hit the nucleus of a target atom head-on.  A nearby detector measures the kinetic energy of the bouncing He ions, and from this energy one can deduce the mass of the atom that was hit. Suppose that the material contains silicon ( Si mass 28 amu) and germanium (Ge mass 73 amu). (The Si and Ge atoms are bound in a crystal, as in the figure, but for the purpose of this calculation you can ignore the bonds and assume that the He atom strikes either an isolated Si atom or an isolated Ge atom). What is the ratio  of the kinetic energies of the He ions bouncing off Si atoms and the He ions bouncing off Ge atoms? Assume that the collision is elastic.

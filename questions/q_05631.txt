Document 1 Attendance Note Client: Ms Mabel Arch - 62 Station Road, Walker, NE6 7ER File Handler: Frank J. Church FJC met with Ms Mabel Arch, art teacher who collects art as a hobby. She is a full time art teacher at a secondary school, primarily. She studied History of Fine Art at University.  In July 2020, when covid-19 restrictions would allow, Ms Arch was in Cornwall when she came across an impressionist oil painting called 'Blue Print of the Future' by Julio De Diego (1900-1979), a Spanish painter who ultimately made his name in America.  She has always been a fan and owns another piece by him called 'Homage of the Spanish Republic', which she had bought in America, so she had been amazed to find this piece in Cornwall.   Ms Arch bought 'Blue Print of the Future' for PS12,000 from an art shop owned by Mr Henry Townshend of 12a The Quays, Portscatho, Truro, TR1 5HX, on the basis that the young shop assistant on the till said it was genuine. Nowhere was it described as a print; the sign just said it was by Julio De Diego. She paid in full at the time.  On return from Cornwall, Ms Arch hung the painting in her classroom and one of her students passed comment that it was 'fake'. Ms Arch was certain it wasn't but had the work inspected by an art expert, Lucille DeGrille, who confirmed the work was a copy. A copy of that report is below.  Ms Arch wishes to claim back the money she paid to Mr Townshend. She has called Mr Townshend to ask for her money back and he was very abusive, saying something like 'it is bloody obvious that it's a print, you daft old bat', which she found very upsetting. Ms Arch makes the point that the asking price had certainly been suggestive of a genuine work.

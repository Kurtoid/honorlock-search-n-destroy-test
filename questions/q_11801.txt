When they connect to this server, they do so through a BuyerInterface software component that's installed in their personal computers. The BuyerInterface component interacts with the Listing Interface in the Real_Estate_Server. This Listing Interface is an interface of the Listing_Processor software component. The Listing_Processor component retrieves listing information from MultipleListings database that is also stored in the Real_Estate_Server. Once a listing has been selected, the buyer connects to the Bank_Server through the same BuyerInterface using TCP/IP protocol. The BuyerInterface connects to the Bank_Server through MortgageApplicationInterface, which is an interface of the MortgageApplication software component. The MortgageApplication software component retrieves necessary information from the CustomerDB that is also in the BankServer. We are interested in modeling one Real_Estate_Server and one BankServer, which are each accessed by several buyers.

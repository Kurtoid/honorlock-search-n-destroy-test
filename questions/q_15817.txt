The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of counseling provided by nurses on depression and coping strategies of infertile women undergoing in vitro fertilization in a mid-western clinic (N = 67). Of the 84 women who were interviewed, 30 were accepted as a comparison group, and 37 were given counseling in addition to routine nursing care services, which included group education and individual interviews about treatment and coping strategies. The nurses also provided support by accompanying the women during the invasive procedures. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Jalowiec's Coping Strategies (JCS) Scale were used for measurements. Scores for the BDI ranged between 0-63, with higher scores meaning higher depression. Items in the the BDI were reviewed by experts who evaluated their appropriateness. The Cronbach alpha of the BDI scale was .69 in the present study. The JCS measured emotional coping strategies and problem-solving abilities of individuals facing stress. The JCS is composed of 40 questions on coping strategies rated on a 1 to 5-point scale. Higher scores show higher utilization of those coping strategies on the scale. The Cronbach alpha value in the present study was .73. There was no statistically significant difference between the comparison and study groups before or after the counseling with respect to depression and coping strategies.

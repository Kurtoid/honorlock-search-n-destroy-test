A biologist wants to determine if a population of snails is evolving in response to the introduction of a predator species.  Snail shells come in three colors.   Homozygous dominant shells (AA) are dark brown, heterozygous shells (Aa) are tan, and homozygous recessive shells (aa) are yellow.   At the start of the study, prior to the introduction of the predator species, there are 45 dark brown snails, 60 tan snails, and 16 yellow snails.  Five years after the introduction of the predator species, there are 62 dark brown snails, 44 tan snails, and 8 yellow snails.   What are the observed genotype and allele frequencies at the start of the study? AA =                                      Aa =                                        aa =  A =                                        a =    What are the expected genotype frequencies after 5 years of predation if the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? AA =                                      Aa =                                         aa =    What are the observed genotype and allele frequencies after 5 years of predation? AA =                                      Aa =                                         aa =  A =                                        a =    Based on your calculations, it it likely that the population is evolving or not?

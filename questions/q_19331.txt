What is the tone and mood of this passage? "There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all."

Read the following selection and answer the question that follows. Contrary to popular belief, you can't catch a cold from being outside on a cold day without a coat or hat. Rather, the only way to catch a cold is to come into contact with a cold virus. Contact can be direct, such as when you hug or shake hands with someone who is carrying the virus, or indirect, as when you touch an object like a keyboard or telephone contaminated with a cold virus. The next time you touch your nose or rub your eyes, you transfer these germs from your hands into your body. You can also catch a cold virus by inhaling virus-carrying droplets from a cough or sneeze of someone with the cold.      The increased frequency of colds during the fall and winter is likely due to people spending more time indoors in the close quarters of classrooms, dorm rooms, and the workplace, which makes the sharing of germs easier. The low humidity of the winter air can also cause the inside of your nose to be drier and more permeable to the invasion of these viruses.      Recently, the herb echinacea has emerged as a popular treatment strategy for the common cold. Echinacea had been used centuries ago by some Native American populations to treat coughs and sore throats. Recent studies have shown that the herb comes up short in preventing or affecting the duration or severity of a cold. The results of a recent review of over 300 studies using echinacea were inconclusive. More research needs to be done to establish whether echinacea can help prevent or treat the common cold.      One of the best ways to reduce your chances of catching a cold is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water. This will lower the likelihood of your transmitting germs from your hands to your mouth, nose, or eyes. One study found that children who washed their hands four times a day had over 20 percent fewer sick days from school than those who washed less frequently. When soap and water aren't available, gel sanitizers or disposable alcohol-containing hand wipes can be an effective alternative. Covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and then immediately washing your hands will help you keep from contaminating the people around you. --adapted from Blake, Nutrition and You, p. 241The main topic of this selection is

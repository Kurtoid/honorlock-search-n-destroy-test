Implement a thread-safe (meaning multiple threads can use it at once) function 'add_head' that adds a new node to the head of a singly linked list. You can assume that 'list' is already initialized with a list of job_node's that contain data values with the address of 'list' pointing to the head of the list. If you need, you may also add code in a global scope, or that runs when the list is first created. Below are some potentially useful functions you may call.    Useful Functions Linux Description   int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *mutex, pthread_mutexattr_t *attr); initialize a mutex   int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex); lock a mutex   int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex); unlock a mutex    struct job_node { int data; struct custom_node* next; }; //TODO REGION 1: (if needed) implement this. struct custom_node* job_list; void init() { job_list = NULL; //TODO REGION 2: (if neede) implement this. } void add_job(struct job_node* node) { //TODO REGION 3: implement this. must be thread safe! }
Convert the following switch statement to an if-else block so the output is the same for all cases. Assume the switch variable is already declared and initialized. Note that some lines may need to be blank, if that is the case and there are multiple lines in the block, the blank line MUST BE THE LAST LINE in the block.  For example (follow this format):   if (a == 10) {  sum += 10;  //LEAVE BLANK }   Instead of (do NOT do this):   if (a == 10) {  //LEAVE BLANK  sum += 10; }  Some lines may be used once, never, or multiple times.  switch (doggo) {  case 'r':  System.out.println("rocko");  case 'c':  System.out.println("chispa");  break;  default:  System.out.println("nope");  case 'm':  System.out.println("moccita"); }     if (1._______________) {  2._______________________  3._______________________ } else if (4._______________) {  System.out.println("chispa"); } else if (5.________________) {  System.out.println("moccita"); } else {  6._______________________  7._______________________     }

Figure 2(a) shows three chips A, B, and C on a board. Assume chip A has 100 I/O pins, chip B has 200 I/O pins, and chip C has 100 I/O pins. Further, chip A has 30 input wires from chip B, chip A has 40 output wires to chip B, chip B has 50 output wires to chip C, and chip B has 30 input wires from chip C as shown in Fig. 2(a).    (a) Give the minimal number of test cycles (clocks) required to fully test stuck-at-0 and stuck-at-1 faults for those 150 wires (i.e., external test) using boundary scan design. Note that the TAP controller starts and ends at state Test-Logic-Reset and the instruction register has 5 bits in each chip. Note: if you forgot to bring a page of boundary scan design architecture, 16 states, and boundary scan cell design, please go to the last (and dummy) question 6 in the bottom of this exam.    (b) Figure 2(b) shows a boundary scan design that can be used to trigger other test methods (circuits). The beauty of this design is that NO extra pins are required to implement the test methods triggered by the boundary scan design. What test methods are supported in this design? (just use one or two sentences to answer, short answer.)

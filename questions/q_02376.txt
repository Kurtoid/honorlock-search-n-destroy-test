8.2 (3 Points) We assume that a file system makes use of the counting approach to managing free blocks in a file system. In this approach, each entry in the counting table stores two items, namely, (1) the address of the first free disk block and (2) the number n of free contiguous disk blocks that follow the first block. Initially, the file system has 512 GB free space, where the block size is configured to 64 MB. How many bytes should be reserved in each entry for the second item (i.e., a counter)?
Consider the permutations method from the textbook, which is intended to return all permutations of the word passed in as a parameter. Which line contains the recursive call in the permutations method? public static ArrayList permutations(String word) {  ArrayList result = new ArrayList();  if (word.length() == 0) // line #1  {  result.add(word); // line #2  return result; // line #3  }  else  {  for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) // line #4  {  String shorter = word.substring(0, i) + word(substring(i + 1); // line #5  ArrayList shorterPermutations = permutations(shorter); // line #6  for (String s : shorterPermutations) // line #7  {  result.add(word.charAt(i) + s); // line #8  }  }  return result; // line #9  } }

8 surveillance drones are deployed to a region, and now need to be assigned to watch a new area in the region. Due to other existing tasks, each drone is only available during a certain period of time during the day. In addition, given each drone location, there are different costs involved with assigning each drone. Table below summarizes drone availability and cost. The problem is to determine a subset of drones that can be assigned to the task, so that the area is continuously watched from 6am to 9pm at minimum cost.  Draw a network, so that the problem can be solved as a shortest path problem. Describe how your approach can be applied to any set of drones (i.e., explain, in general, what nodes and arcs are present in your network). Identify the optimal solution. In the field below type the minimal cost.    Drone Availability Cost   drone 1 6am-noon 100    drone 2  3pm-9pm 300   drone 3 10am-7pm 1000   drone 4 6am-3pm 450   drone 5 noon-6pm 380   drone 6 7pm-9pm 50   drone 7 1pm-4pm 150   drone 8 2pm-9pm 650

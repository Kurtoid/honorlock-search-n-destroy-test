9) Danny is the head coach for a high school rowing team (8 rowers on a boat). At the end of every practice, the team has to row a set distance, from one dock to another.  Danny always tells the team to try as hard as they can. Usually, it takes the team 1 minute to row this set distance from dock to dock. Danny would like his team to row faster.  He buys a device that can automatically measure the force that is being applied by each of the 8 rowers individually. He tells the team members that he'll be keeping track of each of them individually and if anyone isn't rowing as hard as they can, they'll be penalized.  That day the team finishes the set distance in a new record, 50 seconds.The fact that the team rowed faster once Danny could measure each rower's effort individually is consistent with what phenomenon?

You have created a GFP fusion to a protein that is normally secreted from yeast cells. Because you have learned about the use of temperature-sensitive mutations in yeast to study protein and vesicle transport, you obtain three mutant yeast strains, each defective in some aspect of the protein secretory process. Being a good scientist, you of course also obtain a wild-type control strain. You decide to examine the fate of your GFP fusion protein in these various yeast strains and engineer the mutant strains to express your GFP fusion protein. However, in your excitement to do the experiment, you realize that you did not label any of the mutant yeast strains and no longer know which strain is defective in what process. You end up numbering your strains with the numbers 1 to 4, and then you carry out the experiment anyway, obtaining the results shown in Figure Q15-46 (the black dots represent your GFP fusion protein).      Figure Q15-46 Name the process that is defective in each of these strains. Remember that one of these strains is your wild-type control.

Two students decided to repeat the Hershey and Chase experiment, with modifications. Like Hershey and Chase they used radioactive sulfur but they substituted radioactive nitrogen for radioactive phosphate. They reasoned that each nucleotide has only one phosphate and two to five nitrogen atoms. Thus, labeling the nitrogen atoms would provide a stronger signal than labeling the phosphates. Which of the following is the biggest shortcoming in their experimental design?
An intron is a section of ________.

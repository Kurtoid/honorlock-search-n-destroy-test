You are out hiking and you happen upon a mountain biker who appears to have crashed and is lying just off the trial unconscious. You establish that he has a carotid pulse and is breathing normally. You scan for significant bleeding and you only spot abrasions along his lower extremities. You do observe ecchymosis behind the right ear and a clear fluid coming out of that ear. There are no open lesions on the head. He does not open his eyes when you speak, but he does open his eyes when you pinch his clavicle. He does move away from the pain of your pinch. He says inappropriate words. Your appraisal of this situation is:

JUnit: Suppose that you have written a Java class called RationalNumber, with a constructor that takes two arguments of type double; If num and denom are given as arguments, then the rational number num/denom is created, after reducing (i.e., removing the common factors). For example, if we pass 6 and 8 as arguments, we get the rational number, 3/4. That is, new RationalNumber(6, 8) creates the number 3/4. Assume that there is an appropriately defined equals method. We are interested in testing the method for subtraction, which is declared as follows: public RationalNumber subtract(RationalNumber r) This method returns a new rational number that is the result of subtracting r from this. For example, if r1 represents 3/4 and r2 represents 2/3, then r1.subtract(r2) returns 1/12. For the above subtract method, write a single test method in Java/JUnit that uses input values that are not already given in the previous paragraph. Fill in the code below:

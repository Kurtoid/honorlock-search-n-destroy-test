Intro. to Stats - Test Show working  Consider the following data:                                                       Condition Present       Condition Absent                Test Result +                           150                                10                Test Result -                              25                                 75                One person is randomly selected from the group    (a) Find Prob( Test Result - )                 (b) Find Prob( Test Result + and  Condition Absent )          For the data in question 1, find:            (a) Prob( Condition Present | Test Result - )              (b) Prob( Test Result + | Condition Absent )          If P(A)=0.65, P(B)=0.1 and P(A or B)=0.35, find P(A and B).               Are the events in question 3 mutually exclusive ? Explain.                    Laura has 7 Stats textbooks that she is going to place on a shelf. How many different arrangements of the books are possible if the order of the books on the shelf matters to Laura.             A university advertises to fill 2 positions for Statistics teachers. 24 people apply. In how many ways can the positions be filled ?             (a) Calculate 8P3 (b) Calculate 14C0                    X             0           1            2             3            P(X)        0.7      0.05         ?           0.1   What does P(2) equal for this to be a probability distribution?        What is the expected value of the probability distribution in question 8.           a) For a binomial experiment, how many outcomes are possible for each trial ?              b) In a binomial experiment, is it possible for the probability of success to change from one trial                 to the next ?        Consider a binomial experiment with n=10 trials where the probability of success on a single trial is p=0.7. Find Prob(r=4).             (a) What is the expected value of the binomial distribution in question 11 ?                (b) What is the standard deviation of the binomial distribution in question 11 ?            An unfair coin has prob(heads)=0.4. The coin is tossed. What is the prob. that the first tail occurs on the 7th toss ? ( Hint. Note that the word first is underlined ).             A gale force wind occurs on average once every 60 hours on a mountain road. For an interval of 300 hours, what is the prob. that 3 gale force winds are experienced ? ( Hint, use a Poisson distribution. )                   Cleo is a 65% basketball free throw shooter. She is interested in how many attempts it takes to make 4 baskets. What is the probability that it takes 11 attempts ? ( Hint. Note that the number of attempts is the variable in this question .)                 What is the mean and standard deviation of the Standard Normal distribution ?          17. What does a z-score represent ?             18. Consider a normal distribution with mean=20 and standard deviation=4           (a) Find a z value corresponding to an x value of 14                  (b) Find the data value corresponding to a z value of 1.5                 19. Find the area under the standard normal curve          (a)   To the right of z=1.52                 (b)   Between z=1.40 and z=2.03         20. If x has a normal distribution with mean=40 and standard deviation=15,         find Prob  ( 30

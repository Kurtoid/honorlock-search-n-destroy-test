What is the output of the following segment of code if the value 4 is input by the user? int num; int total = 0; cout > num; switch (num) {     case 1:     case 2:   total = 5;     case 3:   total = 10;     case 4:   total = total + 3;     case 8:   total = total + 6;     default:  total = total + 4; } cout
Heating a mixture of 1,3-diphenylacetone and acrolein in trimethylamine gives a product, C18H16O, in 53% yield. The mechanism for product formation is a Michael addition followed by an intramolecular aldol condensation. Which of the following is the product of this reaction?

In biofilm-forming bacteria, intracellular signaling molecules serve as messengers to coordinate a shift from ________ to ________ growth.
A client is receiving continuous bladder irrigation following prostate surgery. Which statement, made by the nurse,   is incorrect?
Pthread Barriers. This is a scary-looking question whose answer is actually simple. In the previous question (Q no XX), if the answer is Yes, explain how. If the answer is No, describe a minimal change to one or both calls (pthread_barrier_init() and pthread_barrier_wait()) to allow POSIX Barriers to additionally be used for Quorum Consensus. That is for the processes who attempt to join the barrier through pthread_barrier_wait() to overcome the barrier and proceed if there is a quorum of such processes who did the same. Give specific changes to the calls showing any new parameters or any pseudo code of variable definitions, or describe what you would do. Specific answer will earn more credit. The barriers system calls are listed below:     pthread_barrier_init (pthread_barrier_t *barrier, const pthread_barrierattr_t *attr, unsigned int count);     pthread_barrier_wait (pthread_barrier_t *barrier);      (No more than 100 words).
You are conducting an experiment in which you add a newly developed fertilizer to plants. You construct a line graph for each test group to compare them. On the graph you put fertilizer added in mg on the x-axis and plant growth in cm on the y-axis. You want to calculate the rate of plant growth for each fertilizer concentration. The units of growth rate will be:
This is the principle that an animal's size is heat-related; smaller bodies are adapted to hot environments, and larger bodies are adapted to cold environments.

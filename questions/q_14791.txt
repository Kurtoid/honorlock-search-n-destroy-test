You can use any calculator or there is a scientific calculator in the browser. Note that you cannot print out the periodic table or equation page during the exam. Make sure you have paper and pencil so you can show your work. After you finish the exam, you must upload a scan (pdf file) of your work within 15 minutes. Be ready to do this (but no phones, etc. allowed during the exam)! Many of the questions will ask you to show your work on paper to get full credit. This will also allow me to give you credit on certain problems if your answer was correct but marked wrong because you used incorrect sig figs, for example. Write your name on every page. You must label the work for each question that requires work using the question number and circle your answer. Don't cram this into a small space - spread it out and make it easily readable for Dr Sue. On your work, don't forget to use correct sig figs and put units on every number and each answer. Show unrounded answers first then round to the correct sig figs. There will be a penalty for problems requiring work if you do not upload work that supports your answer. The 15 minutes for upload is not for finishing the problems. No credit for revisions done after submitting the exam. Some of the problems require manual grading therefore no score will be shown when you finish! I may decide to curve the results or alter question points if necessary (in the students' favor).

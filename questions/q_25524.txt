2. A type of beetle is accidentally introduced into a forest. The population grows according to the model   where t is the number of weeks after the beetles were introduced. a. (1 pt) How many beetles are there at time t = 0? b. (1 pt) What is the continuous growth rate? c. (2 pts) How many beetles will there be after 5 weeks? Round to the nearest whole number. d. (3 pts) When will the population reach 1,500 beetles? Round to two places after the decimal. The model is f(t) = 75 * e^(0.23t)

An n-channel silicon MOS transistor with a metal gate (work function of 4.55 eV) has doping of Na = 1018 cm-3 in the substrate, tox = 4 nm and W = 2L = 200 nm. Fixed charge density is found to be 1014 cm-2 at the oxide/silicon interface. a. Find the flat band voltage with no substrate bias. (hint: 2 terms, watch your units) b. Find the threshold voltage. c. Find the maximum depletion width, Wm. d. Find the depletion capacitance e.

BONUS) You are marooned on a distant planet with strange (non-human) creatures who do not understand your language. (They think the sounds you make are nothing more than grunts.)  They see you as a dangerous animal.  Unless you can prove that you have intelligence, they will surely eat you. The leader of this group offers you a piece of paper and a pencil-like writing instrument.  On this paper you see symbols, which you determine are numbers.  But there is a problem--what number system do they use (i.e., what base, e.g., 10, 2, 8, 16, etc.)?  Since they each have 19 fingers on their upper hand and 18 fingers on their lower hand, you guess it might be base 37. Save your life by solving the below problems (one addition and one subtraction) with the aid of the given table.  You must show all work, i.e., carries and borrows! Use your scratch paper and label this BONUS. Note: Zero is represented as O and is the third character STOP and the second character in COVID!; the letter O is the last character in PLDO. Be very careful to copy they characters properly.

Which of the following interview questions/statements is most likely to result in the misinformation effect?
Use the following scenario to answer the question(s) below.You are talking with some friends. Your friend Jessica says she doesn't believe in climate change, since the Earth has always gone through warming cycles. She says all the impacts we are experiencing now are a result of those cycles, and they will eventually slow down and stop as the Earth comes out of the cycle. "Plus," she says, "it's been really cold this winter, so there can't be a changing climate."  Reference: Ref 10-3   Climate models show that when we consider both anthropogenic and natural forcers together, the result is:

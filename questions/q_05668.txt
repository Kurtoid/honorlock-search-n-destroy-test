Right click on the button below to open the MAP OF NOTTINGHAM ROAD AREA  in a new tab.           3.1.1   Describe the location of Nottingham Road village to someone who is unfamiliar with the area. In your description include the name of the province, as well as access roads and other important landmarks.   (4)      3.1.2   Has the map been drawn "to scale"? Provide a reason for your answer.   (2)      3.1.3   Jon and his friends plan to visit a number of places on the Midlands Meander. Would this map help them to find the venues they are looking for?   (2)                       3.2   The following map shows the small town of Nottingham Road. Refer to this map to answer the questions that follow.               Right click on the button below to open the MAP OF NOTTINGHAM ROAD VILLAGE in a new tab.           3.2.1    Jon wants to know how far it is from the Craft Centre to the turn off to the Art Gallery. (both are located in the top right corner of the map) He measures the map distance as 3cm. Then he uses the bar scale as 1cm represents 400m. Does this mean that the Craft Centre is 1,2km from the Art Gallery turn-off?  Show your working out to explain your answer.    (4)      3.2.2   What direction would you drive in if you are going from the Craft Centre to the Art Gallery?    (2)                       3.3   The four friends decide to visit the Nelson Mandela capture site on the way back to Pietermaritzburg. They get a little bit lost and stop outside Timber 24 on the R103. Google maps gives the following route to get to the capture site.                Right click on the button below to open the NELSON MANDELA CAPTURE SITE  in a new tab.           3.3.1   Write down directions from Timber 24 to the Nelson Mandela capture site.   (4)      3.3.2   The map shows that the distance from Timber 24 to the capture site is 2,9km. If you drive at an average speed of 35km/h, you will reach the capture site in 5 minutes. Use calculations to show that this is true.  The following formula may be used: Distance = speed x time   (4)

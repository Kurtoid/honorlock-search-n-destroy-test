Assume there is a 5-stage pipeline that has no structural hazards and supports data forwarding from the EX/MEM buffers and MEM/WB buffers to the inputs of the ALU muxes in the EX stage. Branch behavior is known at the end of the EX stage of the pipeline. For a given workload, comprised of 30% branches, 20% loads, 10% stores, and 40% ALU instructions, what is the average CPI if:   10% of the branches are miss-predicted and 40% of instructions have a data dependence on the instruction immediately prior to them (e.g., ADD R1, R2, R3 is followed by SUB R4, R1, R1, which is data dependent on the ADD).

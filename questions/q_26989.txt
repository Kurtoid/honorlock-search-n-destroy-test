Although we focused on the hormonal regulation by reversible phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase which acts to regulate glucose levels on a timescale of several hours, it is also important to know that these enzymes are also regulated allosterically on a moment-to-moment basis by a cellular response to glucose levels. In the graph below are the response curves for enzyme activity (glycogen phosphorylase - red curve, glycogen synthase - black curve) over time to adding glucose to a liver cell extract, e.g., all necessary enzymes and substrates for glycogen metabolism.   What is your conclusion regarding allosteric control of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase?

Consider the concentric spherical conductors arranged as shown in the figure below. Each of the dimensions for the conductors are given in terms of the length a. Assume the cavity between the conductors is initially a vacuum. Clearly justify all of your answers to the following questions.    a) Calculate the capacitance for the arrangement of conductors shown in the figure. Your answer should be written in terms of a number and a. b) For the rest of this problem use a = 0.0022 m. Calculate the capacitance of the spherical conductors for a = 0.0022 m. c) A 28 V battery is connected between the inner and outer conductors. How much charge develops on each of the conductor surfaces? While the battery is connected to the capacitor, the vacuum seal starts to leak filling the cavity with a gas that increases the permittivity to 2.08x10-10 C2/Nm2.  Answer the following questions concerning the effect of the dielectric. d) How much energy is stored by the capacitor with a dielectric? e) What is the new charge on the conductors? f) Now the battery is disconnected from the capacitor. If the dielectric gas is removed from in between the conductors, then calculate how much energy is now stored by the capacitor? part a) E = 8.992 x109

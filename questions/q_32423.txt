Given the following reactions: N2 (g) + 2O2 (g) - 2NO2(g)                        DH = 66.4 kJ  2NO (g) + O2 (g) - 2NO2 (g)                      DH = -114.2 kJ Determine the enthalpy of the reaction (in kJ) of the reaction below.  (Chapter 5) N2 (g) + O2 (g) - 2NO (g)                            DH = ?

The gas phase system below is at equilibrium at 200degC with the following partial pressures: 0.20 atm A, 0.20 atm B, 0.10 atm C, and 0.40 atm D. If an additional 0.30 atm C is introduced into the reaction vessel, what will be the partial pressure of C at 200degC when equilibrium is re-established? A(g)  +  B(g)  =  C(g)  +  D(g)
Use the following code for items 26 - 32. The product method will take a variable length parameter list of type int as the only parameter.  The name of this list will be numbers.  The method will return the product of all the values in the array numbers. Examples: product(1, 2, 3, 4) would return 24, product(2, 4, 6) would return 48, and product(10, 20) would return 200.   public static int product( 26 ) {  int prod =  27 ;  for ( 28  num :  29 ) {  prod  30   31  ;  }  return  32 ;  }

Cardiac Output Hybrid: Cardiac output is calculated by[41](41) x [42](42). So if EDV = 150 ml and ESV = 50 ml and the heart is beating 150 times per minute what is cardiac output: [43](43: put in the number in L/min). Stroke volume is determined by 3 things: the amount of blood in the heart before contraction called: [44](44), the pressure the left ventricle has to overcome to get blood out called: [45](45), and the force of contraction called: [46](46). During exercise venous return increases drastically due to increased muscle pump this would lead to an increase in which volume:[47](47: A or B). The strength of heart contraction is controlled by the[48] (48: L, M, or N) which causes more[49](49: O, P, or Q) to flow into cardiac myocytes leading to [50] (50: R, S, or T) and a stronger contraction. This increase in contraction strength increases stroke volume by decreasing [51](51: cardiac measurement).       A. End diastolic volume   E. Systolic blood pressure   I. Afterload   M. Parasympathetic nervous system   Q. Ca++     B. End systolic volume   F. Contractility   J. Heart rate   N. Somatic nervous system   R. Stronger action potential     C. Ejection fraction   G. Stroke volume   K. Aortic stenosis   O. Na+   S. More actin/myosin interaction     D. Mean arterial pressure   H. Preload   L. Sympathetic nervous system   P. K+   T. More filling time

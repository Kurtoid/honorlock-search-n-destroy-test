QM 292 Exam #3 APR Fall 2020.docx The data in the attached document is a snapshot of mortgage loan information obtained from New Century Financial Corporation loan performance data.  Each row represents information on an individual borrower.  The variables in the data set are defined as follows: DEPENDENT VARIABLE: APR - Annual Percentage Rate.  The interest rate charged to the mortgage loan borrower.  The riskier the bank perceives the borrower, the higher the APR charged to the individual borrower.  INDEPENDENT VARIABLES: Back-end-Ratio - represents the amount of debt, inclusive of estimated mortgage payment, per dollar of income.  For example, a back-end-ratio of '20' should be read that $0.20 (twenty cents) of each $1 in borrower income is paid to debt; where debt includes the mortgage payment, borrower's car loan payments and credit cards. Back_end_ratio takes on the value from 0-100. Borr_age - age of the borrower at the time the mortgage loan was approved. Borr_marital_status - 1= married, 0 = unmarried CLTV - combined loan to value.  CLTV is the ratio of the mortgage loan amount to property appraisal value.   For example, a CLTV = 70 means that the mortgage loan is 70% of the appraised value of the home. In other words, if the property is appraised at $100K and the loan amount is $70K, then CLTV = (70/100) x 100 = 70.  CLTV ranges from 0-100. Comb_monthy_income - combined monthly gross income of the borrower and co-borrower. Fico_score  - borrower credit scores.  FICO scores are based on the borrower's credit history.  For example, does the borrower make payments on time and the amount of revolving debt that the borrower has outstanding.  Credit scores take on the value from 350-850.  The lower the borrower's credit score, the greater the risk that the borrower will default on the loan.  As an analyst for the Federal Reserve Bank, you are interested in predicting APR.  You estimate 3 different models. Regression results for three models displayed in the attached file: Model #1, Model #2, and Model #3. Each regression used a .05 level of significance.    The analyst for the Federal Reserve makes the following statements in a press release: a. Model 3 regression results suggest that  on average unmarried borrowers pay a higher APR.   b. At the .05 level of significance, the F-test indicates that none of the models are statistically significant.  At the .10 level of significance at least one of the models is statistically significant. c. For Model #2 and Model #3, the coefficient on CLTV, suggests that there may be a data or model problem. d. For Models #1, #2, and #3, FICO-score is the single most important variable in predicting APR.  Evaluate the Analyst statements.

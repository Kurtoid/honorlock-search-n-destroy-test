Review this Clinical Study and respond to the questions: BackgroundMr. Stevens is a 78-year-old man who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease five years ago.  He was referred by his neurologist to your outpatient rehabilitation center for a speech evaluation and possible treatment.  Family members, including Mrs. Stevens and their three adult children, have complained about difficulty in understanding him.  Mrs. Stevens reports that his voice is extremely soft, that he sounds "breathless," and that he "mumbles."  The children live out-of-state  and communicate mostly with their parents through phone calls, since their parents do not own a computer.  Of late, Mrs. Stevens is finding it more and more difficult to get her husband to talk to the children on the phone.  She's hoping that speech therapy will improve his ability to communicate. Clinical ObservationsUpon meeting Mr. Stevens, you are struck by his stooped posture, and you note that his head hangs forward, both when standing and sitting.  As his wife indicated, his speech intelligibility is reduced due to low intensity, lack of normal prosody, and slurred speech. Clinical MeasuresUsing a handheld spirometer, you obtain Mr. Stevens' vital capacity both in his typical stooped posture and with postural support that helps to improve the alignment between his head and chest.  In addition, you have Mr. Stevens sustain the /a/ vowel for as long as possible, in order to determine his maximum phonation time, which is a measure of available breath support for speech purposes. This activity is also done under the two conditions of his stopped and improved posture.  Spirometric measurements under the stopped postural condition indicate a VC of 2800 ml, compared to the norm of 4470 ml for his age group.  When provided with postural support, his VC improved to 3500 ml.  Maximum phonation time also improved from 3.5 seconds with extremely breath voice to 9 seconds with a stronger voice quality. A. How can you use this diagnostic information to set treatment goals?  B. Suggest one treatment goal that would be appropriate.

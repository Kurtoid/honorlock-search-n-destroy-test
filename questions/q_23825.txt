Your patient rings his call bell and reports that he had sudden onset of severe pain, numbness and coldness in his right leg from the knee down. The symptoms started about 1 hours ago but he did not want to bother you. However, the pain has not resolved. Your patient has a history of smoking and Type II diabetes. For the past few months he has gotten intermittent cramps to his right leg (intermittent claudication). He is currently in the hospital for treatment of pneumonia and dehydration. When you examine the patient, his right leg below the knee is cold, pale and pulseless. Capillary refill on the right leg is 10 seconds and to the left 2 seconds. The right popliteal pulse is palpable but not the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibialis. The patient's vital signs are BP 136/88, P 96, R 18, T 98.2 (oral).

One of the core concepts that we discussed this semester was Critical Environmental Justice (CEJ), which posits that understanding environmental justice issues is facilitated by focusing on four pillars or concepts.  We discussed and reinforced these pillars through a variety of case studies. Below you will be expected to describe or define each pillar in your own words (3 pts each = 12 points) and choose one case study from the list below and relate it to this pillar (3 pts. each =12 points).  You may use a case study example ONLY ONCE - meaning you will need to choose a total of four different case studies to support your answer. You must accurately depict the chosen case studies to receive full credit so be as specific as possible to demonstrate your understanding of the concept/ pillar AND the case study. One or two sentences should suffice to define the pillars and one to two additional sentences to provide the illustrative example from the case studies should be sufficient. There is no correct order or numbering system for the "pillars", but you need to have four (4) different pillars.  Case studies (choose one per pillar) Black Lives Matter Movement Cancer Alley, Louisiana E-waste trafficking Fast Fashion Industry Gullah/Geechee Nation Homelessness in the USA Incarcerated persons in the US prison system Inequality in environmentalism and the 'Great American Outdoors' (Black faces, white spaces) Mountaintop Removal Mining in Appalachia (USA) Sierra Leone Diamond Mining Tilikum the Orca (Blackfish and Species Justice) Water colonialism and indigenous water justice in southeastern Australia

Which one of the following is NOT a possible representation of the visual?
Which of the following leases are most commonly used by community and neighborhood centers?
You believe in the Palace of Crystal, eternally inviolable, that is in something at which one couldn't furtively put out one's tongue or make concealed gestures of derision. But perhaps I fear this edifice just because it is made of crystal and eternally inviolable, and it will not be possible even to put out one's tongue at it in secret.    It's like this, you see: if instead of a palace it was a hen-house, and it began to rain, I might creep into the hen-house so as not to get wet, but I shouldn't take the hen-house for a palace out of gratitude because it had protected me from the rain. You laugh; you even say that in that case it doesn't matter whether it's a hen-house or a mansion. No, I answer, if not getting wet was all one had to live for.    But what if I have taken it into my head that that isn't the sole object of living, and if I have to live, let it be in a mansion? That is my will and my desire. You can drive it out of me only by changing my desire. Well, change it then; attract me by something else, give me a different ideal. Meanwhile, I still refuse to take a hen-house for a palace. ***  Laugh if you like: I will accept all your ridicule, but all the same I won't say I've had enough to eat when I'm hungry, I won't be satisfied with compromise, with the constantly recurring decimal, merely because it exists by the laws of nature and exists in reality. I will not accept as my crowning wish a block of flats for poor tenants on thousand-year leases and, in any case, with 'Wagenheim, Dental Surgeon' as the signboard. Destroy my desire, blot out my ideals, show me something better, and I will follow you.

Read the poem (used for all poetry questions) and answer the question that follows. My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130) By: William Shakespeare My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red; If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damasked, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound; I grant I never saw a goddess go; My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.      And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare      As any she belied with false compare.   What is the rhyme scheme (use only a string of letters with no spaces between them)?
4.    One of your friends on campus who is working on her dissertation in the College of Criminology is considering PLS to run some data. After reading few articles about PLS, she is knocking on your door with a few questions for you.  Please respond to the following two questions below in a way that would impress your peer student and solidify the belief that you are in fact well trained.  Include relevant papers for the doctoral student to read wherever appropriate. a.    She is excited to hear that PLS is the 'new big thing' when it comes to running structural models.  Why is that?  In other words, what are its advantages and disadvantages over the "regular" SEM? (15 points) b.    She is aware of how covariances-based SEM tells her whether her model fits the data.  Is there any way to tell whether a PLS model works? (5 points)
In a power-dependence relation, power reflects the rewards an actor has to offer and:
A distribution of point charges is placed on the coordinate system shown below. The axis is marked in meters. Assume the potential infinitely far from the origin is zero.   a) Calculate the electric potential due to the distribution of charges at point P, which is located at the origin. b) Find the electric potential at r= 8mi+4mj (8m, 4m) labeled as P' in the figure. c) A charge qc = -1.965x10-3 C is placed at the origin and is moved infinitely far away. What is the change in potential energy for qc. d) First of all, qc is removed from the origin. Then a charge of qd=8.65x10-7 C is placed at P'. What is the change in potential energy in moving this charge to the origin? part a) V1 =-3.182 x107 V V2 =1.659x107 V V3 =5.529 x106 V VP =-9.699x106 V part b) 8. Find the contribution to the electric potential at point P' due to charge q2.  Write your answer in scientific notation, and enter the coefficient, rounding to 3 decimal places. Do not include units, and put a minus sign if negative. V2' =         x107 V

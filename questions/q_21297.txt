A real estate agent from State A entered into a contract with a famous movie star from State B. The contract called for the real estate agent to find a suitable mansion for the movie star, with the real estate agent to receive a 10% commission of the mansion's ultimate value as a fee. After finding the movie star a suitable mansion for $10 million, the movie star and the real estate agent had a dispute about the ultimate amount owed to the real estate agent, and the movie star refused to pay any of the commission. The real estate agent thus filed a proper diversity action against the movie star. As part of the litigation, the real estate agent granted her attorney access to her computer and network. The real estate agent's attorney created a list of emails that he believed were relevant to the litigation, including emails where the real estate agent and movie star discussed the commission the agent would earn, and emails between the real estate agent and a colleague where the real estate agent discusses her efforts on behalf of the movie star and the potential commission. The list took the attorney several hours to complete. The defendant served the following request for production on the real estate agent: "All statements and communications between the parties, including any and all statements of the plaintiff and defendants, including emails." Must the real estate agent provide copies of the emails to the movie star?

Dr. Cotta is interested in the causes of behavioral problems among children. To study this, she employs the "Behavioral Tendencies" scale, which uses parents' and teachers' ratings to score children on a scale of 1-70. (Higher scores indicate more behavioral problems.) The population mean on this scale is 29.87. Dr. Cotta suspects that one of the many causes of behavioral problems is a stressful home environment.             She gathers a random sample of 100 children who have been classified as living in a stressful home. For this sample the mean score on the Behavioral Tendencies scale is 36.95. She computes the following test statistic: t = 2.60.

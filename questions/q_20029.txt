QUESTION 1 - 7 Points  Ohio Bottle Company manufactures glass bottles used by breweries throughout the country.  Ohio has developed a process for manufacturing glass beer bottles that uses 50% less glass than the traditional manufacturing process, but results in bottles just as strong as the standard manufacturing process.  Because less glass is used in the manufacturing process Ohio can sell its bottles well below the prices charged by its competitors including Michigan Bottles, its primary competitor.  Ohio's manufacturing process has given it a competitive advantage over its competitors (including Michigan) because Ohio can charge less.  Michigan has been attempting to figure out Ohio's process for years but has been unable to do so.  Ohio has a manufacturing facility located in Toledo, Ohio, where it conducts all of its bottle manufacturing.  Ohio maintains significant security measures at its one Toledo manufacturing facility.  Only upper management employees are admitted into the manufacturing floor and those employees are required to sign strict confidentiality agreements prohibiting them from disclosing any of the details regarding the manufacturing process to anyone else.  The manufacturing facility is locked at all times and requires a special pass and a security code to enter.  There are written plans describing the bottle manufacturing process which are saved on a company server at its facility.  All of those plans are labeled: "Property of Ohio Bottle Company: Confidential.  Unauthorized Use Prohibited".  The server is protected against outside access and only the owner and Chief Technical Officer of Ohio have access to those plans.  Because of a malfunction with Ohio's secure server (which malfunction was beyond Ohio's control), the Ohio manufacturing process was accidentally released via email to several of Ohio's clients and competitors including Michigan.  Michigan immediately made copies of those plans and has used the manufacturing plans to begin building a manufacturing facility utilizing Ohio's bottle making technology.      Ohio has sued Michigan under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.  Michigan has defended on the basis that (A) the manufacturing process does not constitute a trade secret and even if it does, (B) Michigan did nothing wrong in the manner in which it accessed the process because the plans were made available to it by accident from Ohio's computer server.      Required-7 Points:  With regard to Michigan's defense set forth in (A) above, in separately lettered or numbered paragraphs discuss whether the manufacturing process will be a trade secret under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.

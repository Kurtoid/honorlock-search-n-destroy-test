If the values are not the same then the cross pointers of these nodes are assigned to nullptr, see the illustration:   Here is the definition of Node: struct Node {   int value;   Node *next;   Node *cross;   Node(int e) : value(e), next(nullptr), cross(nullptr) {}};Do not change the value of the next pointer.

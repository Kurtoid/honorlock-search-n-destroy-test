BONUS POINTS: What pressure of carbon dioxide is required to maintain the carbon dioxide concentration in a bottle of club soda at 0.12 M at 25 degC? SORT   You are given the desired solubility of carbon dioxide and asked to find the pressure required to achieve this solubility. GIVEN   SCO2 = 0.12 M FIND   PCO2 STRATEGIZE   Use Henry's law to find the required pressure from the solubility. Use the Henry's law constant for carbon dioxide listed in Table 13.4. RELATIONSHIPS USEDSgas = kHPgas (Henry's law)kH,CO2 = 3.4 x 10-2 M/atm (from Table 13.4) TABLE 13.4 (Henry's Law Constants for Several Gases in Water at 25 deg C)                       GAS                                                          kH (M/atm)                         O2    1.3 X 10^-3                        N2    6.1 X 10^-4                        CO2    3.4 X 10^-2                        NH3     5.8 X 10^1                        He     3.7 x 10^-4    SOLVE   Solve the Henry's law equation for PCO2 and substitute the other quantities to calculate it. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upload your work when you are finished with the exam. The reaction shown below is at equilibrium. Vt(OH2)2(g)  +   Tr2S(g)  =  VtS(g)  +  2 TrOH(g)      Kp = 8.41 x 10-6 a.  Write the equilibrium expression for Kp for this reaction on your paper.  You do not need to type anything into Canvas for part a. b.  A flask is filled with 0.187 atm of Vt(OH2)2 and 0.212 atm of Tr2S.  Determine the partial pressures of VtS and TrOH at equilibrium.  You may assume that the change in concentration is very small relative to the starting pressures. partial pressure VtS [VtS] partial pressure TrOH [TrOH]

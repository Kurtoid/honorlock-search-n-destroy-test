A recent study asked U.S. adults if they think that the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of global climate change.  In this study, 67% said yes, they did feel the that the federal government was doing to little to reduce the effects of global climate change.  You take a simple random sample of n = 9 adults. Let X = the number of adults that say yes they feel the federal government is doing to little to reduce the effects of global climate change.   a. On checking the conditions, this is found to be a Binomial distribution.  Three of the conditions are given below:  Binary: Yes, success = yes to the question, failure = no to the question Independent: Yes, the trials are independent. Success:  Yes, the probability of success is the same each trial, p = 0.67.  What is the missing condition? [condition]   b. How many different ways are there to get five U.S. adults who say yes out of the nine adults in the sample? [ways]   c. What is the probability that exactly four adults from the nine adults say yes they feel the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of global climate change? [exactly]   d. What is the sample space of this distribution? [sspace]

DIRECTIONS: Choose the best answer for each question.A Sport for All Koreans [A] The two Koreas - North and South - sometimes work together to promote traditional Korean culture in international organizations such as the United Nations. One successful example of this joint cultural promotion is ssireum - traditional Korean wrestling. In November 2018, after a joint application by the North and South Korean governments, UNESCO approved ssireum for its list of intangible cultural heritage. [B] As a folk style of wrestling, ssireum involves two men (or, sometimes these days, two women) locking on to each other's satba. The satba is a special belt that is wrapped around each wrestler's waist and thigh. While holding each other's satba, the wrestlers grapple,1 trying to use their strength and skill to bring their opponent to the ground. [C] According to experts on Korean history, ssireum has been the national sport of Korea since the fourth century. Although it began as a skill used for war, it eventually became a common sport for men at all levels of society. Even kings in the early dynasties2 enjoyed playing the sport. [D] Unlike other popular sports, ssireum was also an important event at annual holidays and festivals. For example, it was one of the main events on the traditional holiday of Dano, held on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. During this day, a large ssireum tournament was organized, with the champion given a bull as the grand prize. Because most of the wrestlers were farmers, a new bull was very useful since it could improve farm life. The attractive prize ensured that each wrestler tried his best to win.[E] In the 20th century, ssireum became a modern sport. In 1927, a national federation was created to promote and regulate3 the game. Ssireum was given a standard format, including a fighting ring of seven meters and three referees to decide the winner. Although winners of national competitions no longer receive a bull for the grand prize, champions receive the respect of the audience during national television broadcasts. [F] Why, you might ask, is ssireum a good choice to promote Korean culture to the world? First, ssireum is different from other martial arts because its fighting style involves a high level of skin-to-skin contact. This, according to experts, matches the Korean belief in the importance of mutual4 respect and mutual affection. Second, ssireum is based on grappling with an opponent rather than directly hitting them. This makes ssireum a non-violent sport that matches the traditional Korean philosophy of harmony and togetherness. In summary, ssireum is a symbol of peace - the two Koreas' perfect choice for the UNESCO cultural heritage list.1 Two people grapple with each other if they are trying to fight by tightly holding on to each other. 2 A dynasty is a period of time when kings or queens from the same family rule a country.3 To regulate an activity means to ensure that it is controlled by rules that all participants have to follow. 4 Mutual means shared between two people or two groups. Which of the following is NOT a reason why the author thinks ssireum is a good choice for the United Nations cultural heritage list?

The graph below shows oxygen dissociation curves for hemoglobin. The red curve (in the middle) corresponds to hemoglobin under "normal" conditions in red blood cells. The blue (top left) and green (bottom right) curves show the oxygen dissociation curves for hemoglobin with concentrations of H+, CO2, or 2,3-BPG above or below "normal".  (2 pts each, 10 pts)  Blank #1: Which curve shows the binding of O2 by hemoglobin at pH values above "normal"? (blue or green) Blank #2: Which curve shows the binding of O2 by hemoglobin at 2,3-BPG concentrations above "normal"? (blue or green) Blank #3: Which curve shows the binding of O2 by hemoglobin at CO2 concentrations above "normal"?  (blue or green) Blank #4: Assuming the red curve corresponds to adult hemoglobin, which of these curves would correspond to fetal hemoglobin? (blue or green)  Blank #5: What does the O2 concentration value of 27 torr correspond to?

TS-Linux One-shot timer is accurate in delivering a timer interrupt, but it has the overhead of the OS having to field these interrupts and having to re-program the APIC timer after each interrupt event.  Firm timer uses one-shot timer in its implementation.    (i) (2 points) What makes one-shot timer provide nano-second accuracy for timer events?  (ii) (2 points) What makes TS-Linux avoid the overhead of fielding frequent one-shot timer events?  (iii) (2 points) Guestimate the overhead of reprogramming the one-shot timer after each interrupt.

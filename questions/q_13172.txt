This problem statement applies to questions 44-47:  A sled is pulled to the top of a hill. The sketch above indicates the shape of the hill. At the top of the hill the sled is released from rest and allowed to coast down the hill. At the bottom of the hill the sled has a speed v and a kinetic energy E (the energy due to the sled's motion). Answer the following questions. In every case friction and air resistance are so small they can be ignored. Question 44: The sled is pulled up a steeper hill of the same height as the hill described above. How will the velocity of the sled at the bottom of the hill (after it has slid down) compare to that of the sled at the bottom of the original hill? Choose the best answer below. A. The speed at the bottom is greater for the steeper hill.B. The speed at the bottom is the same for both hills.C.

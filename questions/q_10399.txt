Examine the following closed economy: C = 2,000 + (3/4)*(Y - T) I = 12,000 - 125,000*r Gbar = 4,000 Tbar = 4,000 Mbar = 24,000 P = 2 L(Y,r) = Y - 100,000*r   a) Derive the IS and LM curves and use them to calculate the short-run equilibrium level of output (Y), the real interest rate (r), consumption (C), and investment (I). b) Assuming we are initially in the long-run equilibrium in part (a), describe how an adverse LM shock (maybe due to an increase in the demand for real money balances) affects output (Y), the real interest rate (r), the level of investment (I), and the price level (P)  in the short-run. Describe what happens to these variables in the transition to the new long-run equilibrium in the absence of any monetary or fiscal policy.

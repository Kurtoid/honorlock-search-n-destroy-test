George and Susan play a centipede game.  George goes first.  He can either take the larger of two piles of money which would be $50 and give Susan the smaller, $10, or pass.   If he passes, the smaller pile gets $10 more and the larger pile is divided in half.  So we end up with $25 and $20.   Then Susan can pick the larger pile and give George the smaller or pass.  If Susan passes the smaller pile gets $10 more and the larger pile is divided in half, even if there is a fraction.   It goes on like this until everyone has had two turns.  If the last player passes, the two piles are added together and each player gets half.  Draw a graph, label every node using backwards induction and tell me how each player should play.  Upload the results.

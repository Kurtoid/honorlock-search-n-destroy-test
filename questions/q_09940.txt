9)  The two spectra below are both of Nylon-66.  Predict which was from infrared versus Raman.  Note, the top one is just plotted upside-down for comparison of the peak intensities (it does not mean it is transmittance mode).  Match the following marked peaks with their corresponding vibrational modes, and also match which spectrum corresponds to infrared versus Raman.  Top spectrum (Infrared / Raman) [1] Bottom spectrum (Infrared / Raman) [2]

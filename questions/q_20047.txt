Apply the formula that corresponds to Weber's Law to solve this just noticeable difference problem: Research finds that children notice larger cereal boxes at the grocery store than smaller ones. Research also shows that in order to notice the difference in size, a 12-inch x 8-inch sized cereal box would have to increase in height and width by at least 15%. Which of the following dimensions would you recommend to ensure that children just notice that your brand's cereal boxes are larger than your competitors' 12-in. x 8-in. sized cereal boxes?

Use the five-step method (on scratch paper)  to determine the offspring of the cross between a man heterozygous for type B blood with a woman that is heterozygous for type A blood. Use IA for the A allele, IB for the B allele and i for the O allele.  State the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of the offspring. You do not have to use superscripts (you can put IBi instead of IBi).  Step 1: The genotypes of the parents would be the man [blank1] x the woman [blank2].  Step 2: The possible alleles in the gamete from the man would be [blank3] and [blank4].              The possible alleles in the gamete from the woman would be [blank5] and [blank6].  Step 3: The punnett square would require [blank7] squares, in a [blank8]x[blank9] arrangement.  Step 4: The first box, in the upper, left-hand corner would have the genotype [blank10] in it.  Step 5: The predicted genotypic ratio for this cross would be [blank11]IAIB:[blank12]IAi:[blank13]IBi:[blank13}ii             The predicted phenotypic ratio for this cross would be:             [blank14]typeAB:[blank15]typeA:[blank16]typeB:[blank17]type O

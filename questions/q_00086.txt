Carlos designed a study examining memory strategies for his PSY 250 course. His stated hypotheses were:  "It is predicted that utilizing imagery improves word recall more than rehearsal alone, furthermore, combining rehearsal and imagery will result in increased recall of words compared to either rehearsal or imagery alone.  It is further predicted that advanced education decreases the influence of imagery." Below is his participant section for his paper.   Participants Participants will be categorized according to education level; high school graduate, college graduate, graduate school graduate. The participants will be equally distributed between three conditions (rehearsal, imagery, and rehearsal & imagery).  Rewrite Carlos' Participant section so it includes all the pertinent information (hint you will have to go beyond info given)

Community Changes In southern California, algae growing on boulders was disturbed every time boulders were overturned by waves. Sousa studied algal succession on the boulders. Sousa made the following observations  The first to colonize was always the seaweed Ulva lactuca. It was followed by a red alga, Gigartina canaliculata.  C. Based on Figure 3, Ulva might inhibit the succession of the red algal species (Gigartina) but in observations in the field, Ulva is not always the dominant species in terms of percent coverage of rocks. What are two different possible explanations (hypotheses) preventing 100% dominance by Ulva? Briefly explain each. (4pts) Note: I am asking for two answers. Please provide a brief explanation too.

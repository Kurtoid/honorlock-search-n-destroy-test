**Note: you will use this same artificial cell scenario for the next four questions. Imagine an artificial cell that is composed of a selectively permeable membrane.  The interior of the cell contains an aqueous solution (meaning water is the solvent) consisting of 4M galactose, 1M carbonate, and 0.00001M hydrogen ions.   This 'artificial cell' is immersed in a beaker containing a different solution. The solution in the beaker consists of 2 M galactose + 0.001M hydrogen ions (and again, water is the solvent).  The membrane is permeable to water and to small molecules such as galactose and hydrogen ions, but it is not permeable to larger ions such as carbonate.

A small boy in a yellow slicker and red galoshes ran cheerfully along beside the newspaper boat. The rain had not stopped, but it was finally slackening. It tapped on the yellow hood of the boy's slicker, sounding to his ears like rain on a shed roof . . . a comfortable, almost cozy sound. Using your own words, explain what the writer means by each of the words in italics and bold.   (3)

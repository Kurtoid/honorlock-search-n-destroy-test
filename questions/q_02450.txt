A hypothetical population of 500 cats has two alleles, T and t, for a gene that codes for tail length. (T is completely dominant to t.) The table below presents the phenotype of cats with each possible genotype, as well as the number of individuals in the population with each genotype. Assume that this population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Recall that the Hardy-Weinberg equation is p 2 + 2pq +q 2 = 1.  Answers can be used once, more than once, or not at all.

Some students have been told that people remember words that are written in green ink better than red ink. Therefore, I collected data from 3 sections of Psych 202. My 1:00 pm class had a list of words in blue ink to memorize. My 2:30 pm class had a list of words in green ink to memorize. My 4:00 pm class had a list of words in red ink to memorize. After a delay, student recalled as many words as they could. MBlue = 22, MGreen = 20, and MRed = 18. All classes had 20 students in each class and the SSTotal = 1085. Use the 7 steps of hypothesis testing to conduct an ANOVA that explores if ink color influences memory recall and use an a = .01. 1) IV: [IV] DV: [DV] number of tails: [tails] 2) State Hypotheses: Null: [Null] Alternative: [Alternative] 3) What is your critical value? [critical] 4) Calculate the appropriate test statistic. Show your work. Numerator = [Numerator] Denominator = [Denominator] Final obtained test statistic = [TestStat] 5) Decision: [Decision] 6) Effect size: Calculation/work: [Calculation] Final effect size value = [Effect] 7) Plain English interpretation: [PE] APA statistical information: [APA]

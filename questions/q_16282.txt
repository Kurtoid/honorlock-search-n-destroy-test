Which of the following best explains why heme groups are often buried within protein structures?    Proteins increase the reactivity of hemes so that they can more rapidly transfer electrons. Proteins protect the heme and prevent it from indiscriminately transferring electrons, thus controlling the target and rate of electron transfer. Hemes are very hydrophobic and require surrounding proteins for solubility in aqueous solution. Hemes are very hydrophilic and require surrounding proteins for solubility in lipid membranes.

Dr. Kagan wants to understand how temperamental characteristics are related to shyness in children. He invites children to the lab, where he measures both of these variables. Unbeknownst to Dr. Kagan, the shyest children who were invited to the study decided not to participate because they were uncomfortable interacting with the researchers. After collecting the data, he calculates the correlation coefficient for the relationship between temperamental characteristics and shyness, and finds that it is much weaker than expected. Based on this information, it is possible that Dr. Kagan's findings are due to _____.

Swift Company purchased a machine on January 1, 2019, for $900,000. At the date of acquisition, the machine had an estimated useful life of six years with no salvage. The machine is being depreciated on a straight-line basis. On January 1, 2022, Swift determined, as a result of additional information, that the machine had an estimated useful life of eight years from the date of acquisition with no salvage. An accounting change was made in 2022 to reflect this additional information. What is the amount of depreciation expense on this machine that should be charged in Swift's income statement for the year ended December 31, 2022?
Suppose your program has the following pattern of branch outcomes: NT, T, NT, T, NT. The following questions deal with the 2-bit predictor with states: 00 (strongly not taken), 01 (not taken), 10 (taken) and 11 (strongly taken). (a) What is the accuracy of always-taken and always-not-taken predictors for this sequence of branch outcomes? (b) What is the accuracy of the two-bit predictor for this pattern, assuming that the predictor starts off in the 00 state? (c) What is the accuracy of the two-bit predictor if this pattern is repeated forever (e.g., in a loop)? Thus the pattern will be: NT, T, NT, T, NT, NT, T, NT, T, NT, NT, T, NT, T, NT, ...

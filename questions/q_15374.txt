The picture below is of peppered moths, a moth commonly found around London, England. It naturally has two color forms as shown on the picture, a light form and a dark form. Before the industrial revolution, the lighter form was the most common because it allowed the moth to blend in better with tree bark. However, during the industrial revolution, coal soot darkened the bark of trees around London. The lighter moths were easier for predators to see and eat but the darker moths blended in with the darker tree bark. Over time, the darker form of moth became more common. The allele for moth color, is a trait that is heritable (passed on to offspring through DNA) and conferred an advantage in that environment. This is an example of which of the following concepts?

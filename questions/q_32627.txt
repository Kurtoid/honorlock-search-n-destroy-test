Write a function that will perform a sequential search on an array and return the first item in the array that differs by more than 5 from the previous item. If there is no such item found in the array, the function will return -1. For example, given the following array: 1 4 7 3 5 8 12 17 11 10 6, will return 11, because the difference from 17 to 11 is more than 5.

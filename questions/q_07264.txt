Question 3. [35 points] Forever Young is a fashion and apparel retailer in the United States. The company has historically outsourced production to China. Sourcing from the Chinese supplier costs $6.50/unit. Management have identified demand and exchange rates as the two major uncertainties faced by the company. Over each of the next two periods (assume them to be a year each), demand may go up by 10 percent with a probability of 0.5, or down by 10 percent with a probability of 0.5. Demand in the current period was 1,000,000 units. Similarly, over each of the next two periods, the exchange rate may fluctuate causing the cost per unit increase by 5 percent with a probability of 0.5, or decrease by 5 percent with a probability of 0.5.   [15 points] Draw a decision tree (on paper) reflecting the uncertainty over the next two periods. Identity each node in terms of demand and exchange rate and the transition probabilities.  [20 points] What is the NPV of expected cost over the periods for the Chinese supplier? Assume a discount factor of k=0.1 per period.

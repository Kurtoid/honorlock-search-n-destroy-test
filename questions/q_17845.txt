Using the Gauss-Seidel Method to solve the equations below with an initial guess of x1 = x2 = x3 =10. These equations have been transferred to its augmented matrix form on the "Exam2-Q7" tab. -4x1 - x2 + 12x3 = 2400 15x1 - 3x2 - x3 = 3300 -3x1 + 18x2 - 6x3 =1200 To use Gauss-Seidel Method, you will need to (1) rearrange the rows in an augmented matrix to be a diagonally dominant matrix, (2) solve for each variable on the diagonal, (3) iterate x1, x2, and x3 values using your initial guess values. Answer the following questions directly on the "Exam2-Q7" tab: (1) What are the expression equations for x1, x2, and x3? (2) Solve this SLAE using the Gauss-Seidel Method in fifteen (15) iterations. Note: This is an Excel spreadsheet problem and no programming is required. Once complete, please type a one-word essay (e.g., "ok") for this question and then upload your combined Excel file at the very end of this exam.

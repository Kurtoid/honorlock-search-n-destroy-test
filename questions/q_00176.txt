Lectura Read this article and answer the questions. (5 x 3 pts. each = 15 pts.)         Hola, Eduardo:      !Que bien me lo pase el verano con mis papas en Espana! Visitamos, vimos, conocimos, conversamos, paseamos, tomamos cientos de fotos, pero sobre todo1, !!comimos!! !Que comida tan buena! Y lo mas interesante es que, en un pais tan pequeno, varia mucho de region a region. Por eso lo probamos todo.      Comimos ensaladas, sopas, la famosa paella, todo tipo de pescados y mariscos..., y todo preparado de una manera muy simple, con ajo, perejil2 y aceite de oliva3. Por eso todo tenia un sabor muy natural y autentico. El aceite de oliva fue lo mas nuevo e interesante. Los espanoles lo usan para todo.      ?Y de postre? Los dulces son muy variados, muy ricos y no tan "dulces"; por eso, no tienes que preocuparte... comi mucho, si, pero llevo la misma ropa de siempre, la que a ti te gusta.      ?Y las tapas? !Que buena idea! Son pequenisimos platos preparados con una gran variedad de ingredientes. Comer tapas es una excelente oportunidad para conocer gente y conversar. Este verano vamos tu y yo. A ti tambien te va a encantar.

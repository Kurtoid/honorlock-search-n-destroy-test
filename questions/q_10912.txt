Paging through his personal copy of Hemispheres, the United Inflight magazine, Orphy noted that the volume inside the fuselage of the 787 is 980 m3 and that it was pressurized to the equivalent of 6,000 feet altitude.  He wondered how much that increased the mass of the plane compared to using the oxygen masks and not pressurizing the plane (but still keeping it at 25oC).  If the atmospheric pressure at 6,000 ft is 609 Torr and at 40,000 ft it is 140 Torr, how much heavier is the plane (in kg) because it is pressurized? Recall that 760 Torr = 1 atm, and assume an average molar mass of air of 29.0 g/mol.   Turn in your work if you want partial credit!

Expression of adenylate cyclase (encoded by the cya gene) and CAP (encoded by the crp gene) is essential for expression of all catabolite-sensitive operons. In your studies, you are interested in isolating strains containing mutations in either cya or crp. To do so, you utilize the tetrazolium salt selection method in which bacterial colonies only appear red when they cannot ferment the carbon source supplied in the plate. Your assistant mutagenizes some bacteria and spreads them on plates containing maltose as a carbon source and tetrazolium salts. He identifies red colonies which he thinks likely have mutations in cya or crp genes. Given your infinite wisdom in bacterial genetics, you tell him you aren't so sure. Explain 1) what one alternative explanation for what his red colonies could be, if it isn't due to cya or crp mutations? Also, 2) what should he do to enrich for cya or crp mutants and how can he be certain they are cya or crp mutants once he selects colonies?

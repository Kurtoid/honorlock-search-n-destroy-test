A research company decided to test this claim and 40 individuals were recruited. The initial (before) weight of all the 40 participants were recorded. Half of them were asked to follow the diet plan developed by Group 1 dieticians and the remaining half followed the diet plan of Group 2 dieticians for 8 weeks.

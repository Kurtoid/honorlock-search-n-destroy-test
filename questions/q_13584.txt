Jimmy made harassing phone calls to Barry for a full week before Barry had a big presentation at work (a project that was very important to Barry's job).   According to Barry, Jimmy "told him that he would be fired if he paused more than 5 seconds during the presentation" and said that he (being Jimmy) would be leaving the morning of the presentation with Barry's wife to make a "social" trip. This distressed Barry to no end. Barry had a emotional breakdown over the calls and later sued Jimmy for the tort of "Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress" and seeks $2 million. Jimmy contends he didn't say those things. If this case is brought in Texas State Court, what court will hear it first:

For the rest of this exam, use the following application architecture description as the basis to answer the below questions: Overview - The application is called "CCAPP".  It has a web-based front-end interface and exposes several services for other applications to utilize. Web Infrastructure -  All the application components are written in .NET and deployed on 2 app pools on 3 IIS servers named WIIS1.acme.com (with IP 10.20.10.101), acme.com (with IP 10.20.10.102), & WIIS3.acme.com (with IP 10.20.10.103) - they each listen on port 80. One app pool is for the web-based user interface and utilizes the "/ccapp" virtual directory, while the other app pool is for the web services and uses the "/ccapp-apis" virtual directory The IIS servers are part of two pools (one for each virtual directory) front-ended by a load balancer. The load balancer exposes two VIPs (ccapp.acme.com with IP 204.153.78.20 for the user interface and ccapp-apis.acme.com with IP 204.153.78.21 for the web services) to the internet. The load balancer proxies the web servers and populates the X-Forwarded-For HTTP Header for both pools Both app pools are recycled in a rolling fashion (one IIS server at a time) each night There is no "session stickiness" because the session state is stored in a database  Security & Network  There is a firewall in between the load balancer and the IIS servers The application's front-end interface is protected by an OAUTH cloud-based service that has a replicated copied of the company's Active Directory. For any user to authenticate to the application it needs to be defined in AD and part of the ccapp-users group. The application's web services are protected by IP-filtering (only certain IP addresses are allowed to connect to them) and application tokens (long strings) are individually shared with each client There is a firewall in between the IIS servers and the database server  Database & Other external factors  CCAPP utilizes a SQL Server database (IP 10.20.20.100) for its application data and its session state (only applicable to the user interface) CCAPP (UI & services) makes calls to internal web services that have their own web and database servers. The application also makes calls to web services on the Internet The application is 24x7, but also has a nightly batch job component that performs heavy updates for a couple of hours Transaction log backups occur every 30 minutes, differential backups nightly and full backups weekly on Sundays Index rebuilds and/or reorgs (depending on the state of each index) as well statistics updates are performed on a weekly basis as well The database is large (over 3TB) and replicated to another location asynchronously for disaster recovery purposes  Personnel  Assume you have access to a business user representative, an ITSM practitioner, server engineer, DBA, web hosting engineer, network engineer & an application developer  The following are the answers provided to the above:  Ask the ITSM practitioner if any relevant changes were performed recently - an application change was deployed the night before  Ask the ITSM practitioner (with access to the Helpdesk) & business user representative if any other applications are experiencing performance problems - No other applications experiencing issues  Ask the business user representative if they can provide the IP address of a user with the problem - The IP address 10.4.53.5 is provided  Ask the Web Hosting engineer to see if any of the members in the load balancer pool for this application are down - No pool members are down  Ask the Server engineer if any of the IIS servers or the database server is experiencing high activity - The IIS servers have low CPU activity, but the SQL Server is at 100% CPU utilization  Ask the Database administrator to see if the database has been corrupted - The database is not corrupted  Ask the Network engineer to see if there is high utilization on the Internet circuit - The Internet circuit is not experiencing high utilization  Ask the Network engineer to see if he is seeing packets going to the database server being dropped by the firewall - No dropped packets observed     Based on the above answers, select the three most appropriate follow-up questions/actions. - 10 points

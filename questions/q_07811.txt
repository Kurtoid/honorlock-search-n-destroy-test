Shrute Farms purchased a tractor at the beginning of 2017 at a cost of $100,000.

Mary is the operations manager at a company that makes model aircraft, and she just got the bad news: the boss is discontinuing her line of model aircraft. "But don't tell anybody," he warns; if the consumers with orders find out, they might cancel their order or ask for a steep discount on a discontinued product. Mary's supplier in Brazil doesn't know the line will be discontinued either; they're still churning out model aircraft parts. If she doesn't tell them to stop, they'll continue manufacturing--and every part they build tomorrow will be worthless. She relays this to her boss. "Do we have a contract with them?" he asks. They already filled your most recent contract, and she hasn't made a new one. "Then don't tell them anything," says the boss. "Act as if nothing has changed."  If Mary concludes that she should not tell the supplier because her primary responsibility is to protect the bottom line of her organization, which approach to deciding ethical dilemmas is she following?

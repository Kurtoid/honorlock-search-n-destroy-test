Super Typhoon Rolly 31/12Z 155KTS =   Date/Time  Wind-speed in knots Super typhoon Rolly hit the northern Philippines and raced across the capital, Manila, affecting two million people and killing at least 16. The storm destroyed thousands of homes and damaged the crops of more than 26,000 farmers. Estimates of crop damages exceed $36 million, according to the Philippines Department of Agriculture. Typhoon Rolly is the strongest storm to hit the Philippines in 2020. It passed through the Philippines and weakened after hitting the densely populated Manila area early on November 1. It is the most powerful storm to hit the country since Typhoon Haiyan killed more than 6,000 people in 2013.  "We have experienced terrible wind speeds, lashing rains, and devastating flooding," Oxfam Philippines' Country Director Lot Felizco said. "Typhoon Rolly knocked out mobile phone service, power lines, uprooted trees, and caused damage to critical infrastructure, including hospitals and markets. Homes made of light materials, particularly those near Mayon Volcano, were engulfed in floodwater and volcanic mudflows." Typhoon Rolly was the Philippines' 18th tropical cyclone for 2020. An average of 20 tropical cyclones form near the Philippines each year. Typhoon Rolly was the third consecutive typhoon that hit the Philippines in two weeks.

Aging is associated with both calcium resorption from bone and calcium accretion within the vasculature.  Despite this intriguing correlation between bone mineral density and vascular calcification, a direct biological link has been minimized because osteoporosis and vascular calcification were considered non-modifiable, passive consequences of ageing. However, recent data now suggest that this association is not simply an artifact of age and that pathological and nutritional factors may overlap the relationship between arteriosclerosis and osteoporosis.  Provide support for a hypothesis that suggests both vitamins D and K can increase the mineralization process in bone and concomitantly decrease the mineralization process in vascular tissue.

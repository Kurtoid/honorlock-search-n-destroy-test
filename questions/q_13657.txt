Revise and rewrite the body paragraph's conclusion sentence for improvement.                                                Introduction: 1.Imagine how many families in America include a family member who regularly gambles. 2.Several recent studies prove that the numbers are large, but many people do not understand the effect that gambling has on the family (Jost 56). 3.Susie Smith, author of the book Families in Crisis and a professor of Sociology at Yale University, argues that excessive gambling leads to broken homes. 4.In her article, "Gambling in America-Does Excessive Gambling By a Parent Negatively Impact His or Her Family: Pro," she defends her position on the dangers of gambling. 5.On the other hand, James Johnson, a law professor at Stanford, condemns excessive gambling, but he does not believe it ultimately hurts families; he validates his position in his article, "Gambling in America-Does Excessive Gambling By a Parent Negatively Impact His or Her Family: Con." 6.Smith uses outside sources and appeals to logic, while Johnson focuses on statistics and appeals to emotion, as these elements help him support his position.             First Rhetorical Tool body paragraph: 7.Rhetorical tools are used throughout Smith's article. 8.She uses outside sources to defend her argument about gambling. 9.Smith cites a 2010 report published in the Journal of Family Law and written by James McKey indicating that excessive gambling is a leading cause of marital break-ups in the United States (Smith, par. 5). 10.The rate of divorce due to excessive gambling is even higher when children are involved (par. 5). 11.Studies show, unfortunately, that the "[p]ainful effects of their parents' breakups can stay with children for years" (par. 7). 12.Smith quotes Edward W. Barth, a psychiatrist and author of the new book Adult Children of Divorce, who observes that "children of single mothers get involved in substance abuse and other troubling behaviors . . . more than kids with fathers at home" (par. 6). 13.Smith continuously places blame on the party who gambles, whether it is the wife or husband. 14.It is so imperative that you do not excessively gamble because it may lead to divorce, which then may hurt the children. 15.Susie Smith cites outside authorities to note the painful effects of divorce that can result when a parent excessively gambles.

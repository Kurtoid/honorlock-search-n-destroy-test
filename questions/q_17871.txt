EXHIBIT 3.2 SIX MECHANISMS FOR COORDINATING AND CONTROLLING WORK ACTIVITIES Mutual Adjustment:  Workers consult with each other informally about what needs to be accomplished and how.  Responsibility for coordination and control rests with those who do the work. Direct Supervision:  A supervisor is assigned to take responsibility for a group of workers and a managerial hierarchy is established to integrate the efforts of all work groups.  The supervisor issues personal instructions and monitors individual performance. Standardization of Work Processes:  Work is programmed in advance of its execution by developing rules and standard operating procedures specifying how everyone is to perform assigned tasks.  Coordination is built into the work process itself and control is achieved by strictly limiting each worker's discretion. Standardization of Work Outputs:  Work outputs are programmed in advance by providing each work group with product specifications or performance goals and allowing members considerable latitude in determining how to achieve them.  Control is exercised by collecting output data , requiring corrective action when needed, and rewarding and sanctioning workers based on results achieved. Standardization of Worker Skills:  Workers are employed who possess the knowledge and skills needed to make appropriate decisions.  Educational institutions and professional associations are relied upon to provide standardized training.  Professionally trained workers are largely self-coordinating and self-controlling. Standardization of Values:  Organizational leaders communicate and act upon a clear vision of what the organization exists to do, where it should be headed, and what values should guide it.  Coordination and control is facilitated by commitment of organizational members to shared, internalized values and ideals.

People typically want to do well and will do so if encouraged to do so.     Emphasis on:   Emphasis on:     Material rewards and punishment   Meaningful work & opportunities to self-actualize     Management control systems & tactics      (e.g., standard operating procedures, performance measurement systems, pay for performance schemes)   Reduced reliance on management control systems and tactics     Command and Control approach to supervision   Role of leadership/management should be one of teacher and consultant; collegial & rarely pushy boss     Centralized decision structures (limited grants of authority to workers)   Decentralized decision structures (broad grants of authority to workers closest to the work situation).

A semicrystalline polymer has a nucleation index n of 2 and a rate constant k of 0.007 s-2 at 90 degC. This polymer is melted and then quenched to 90 degC and allowed to crystallize.  (a) What is the percent of crystallinity of the sample after 10 s.                                                                                                     (3 pts) (b) Assume you need a sample with lower crystallinity now. However, you cannot change the crystallization process. Will you select a semicrystalline polymer of higher or lower molecular weight to start with than the one in (a)? Justify your answer.

Given the following road map as shown in class. Consider a search tree (the root node has depth 0) that illustrates the state-space explored by A* starting from the city Timisoara (T). Answer questions about the search tree below. The nodes are labeled using the first letter of the names of the cities on the map. Remember, nodes that have already been explored should not be explored again.   Use the Straight-line distance in the table shown above for the estimated cost h(n) between node n and the node of the final destination B for Bucharest. Use g(n) as the true cost from the origin to node n. Remember that A* uses f(n) = h(n) + g(n) to estimate the total cost from the origin to the destination. Compute the f value of the following nodes that may or may not be part of the search tree. Enter a numerical value only. Nothing else will be recognized. L, f= [f_L] M, f=[f_M] Z, f = [f_Z] D, f=[f_D] R, f=[f_R]

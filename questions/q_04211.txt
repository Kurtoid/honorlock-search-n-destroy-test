Use the following table to answer the problems included in this practice exercise.    Rules  Operational considerations    1 The oxidation number of an atom in an elemental substance is zero.    2 The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to the ion's charge.    3 Oxidation number for common elements H, O , and halogens:H: +1 when combined with nonmetals; -1 when combined with metals.O: -2 in most compounds; Sometimes -1 (so-called peroxides, O22-); Very rarely -  1/2  (so-called superoxides, O2-); Positive values when combined with F (values vary).Halogens: -1 for F always; -1 for other halogens except when combined with oxygen or other halogens (positive oxidation numbers in these cases, varying values).    4 The sum of the oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals the charge on the molecule or ion.

Record with good oral expression (Record with feeling and friendly facial expressions); you are telling a story about "yourself" and you want to be certain that the listeners want to listen to you or even meet you. Your fluency (no hesitations and restarts) and "feeling" (good oral expression) will earn you points!  Your oral narration will tell me if you truly understand what you are saying. Take part of your set-up time to read the "Scene"; it will tell you exactly what I am looking for! When finished, follow the instructions at the bottom of this question.

Save/Upload/Submit (whichever is appropriate for the recorder you are using), your final recording to this question. If you are using the Canvas Recorder, and you accidentally save or submit before you have finished, you may have to refresh the page to use the Canvas Recorder again. (But,since this is a one-attempt exam, if the refreshing action keeps you from accessing the question again, you will have to keep the recording you saved.) If you do end up with more than one recording in the text area, label the recording to grade as "Final" so I will know which one to listen to and grade!

When doing research, Zach found three articles about a controversial issue.  The first article was published in 1991, but the other two were published in 2014 and 2017.  He found that the older article was had information that has changed and is not accurate anymore, while that other two was more up-to-date.  Based on the CRAAP Test, what point does this represent?

VOCABULARY: Lesson A Read the text. Notice the bold words. Then write the correct bold word to complete each definition.Situation comedies are one of the most popular types of show on TV. Some of the interest comes from the characters in the show, when they behave strangely or tell a joke. But a lot of the real fun in a comedy like this comes from the situations these people find themselves in.  In the past, TV studios recorded people laughing and just played the recordings at amusing moments during their shows. This was called 'canned laughter.' The sound was never really natural and TV audiences didn't like it. That is why studios started inviting people to come and watch the shows 'live'--so the laughter sounded more natural. ________________ are how things are at certain times and places.

BMED 2110 - Final Exam (quiz 10) Recent research concerned with fuels used for jets and airplanes has shown that the addition of natural products leads to an increase in the stored energy associated with these fuels. A candidate for this application has been isolated form pine wood. It is a molecule with the structure C10H16 . In order to determine the enthalpy of formation of this unknown molecule it is injected with a rate of 1.36 g/min into a reactor. A second inlet stream is air, which enters the reactor at a flow rate of    32.8 l/min and a temperature of 127 C.  The molecule reacts with the oxygen in the air to form CO2 and H2O, the degree of conversion of the molecule is 100% and the reactor loses  133W  as heat to the environment. The temperature of the product stream is 1.75*103 K. Calculate the specific molar enthalpy of formation of the unknown molecule for its reference state at standard pressure and Temperature.    You might need the following data for your analysis: Properties of the unknown substance: chemical structure: C10H16 density 0.858 g/ml  melting point: -63C  boiling point 156.85 C   Enthalpies of formation: Water(liq): -285.83 kJ/mol Water (gas): -241.82 kJ/mol CO2 (gas): -393.51 kJ/mol   Hints: For your calculation you must correctly fill out the NH-table, which is provided below (a copy of this table was sent out prior to the quiz, if you do not have it at hand you may draw your own table. A degree of freedom analysis is not required, however you might use it to your advantage.

The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci,                                   The Last Supper by Tintoretto A comparison of Tintoretto's The Last Supper with Leonardo's The Last Supper will show the dramatic changes that had taken place in both art and the concept of art over almost a century. A. In Tintoretto's work the space is sliced by a sharp diagonal, it has asymmetrical balance which only enhances the energy and movement of the composition. Leonardo's work appears static in comparison with the space divided down the middle and its symmetrical balance, only adds to the balance between emotion and restraint in his composition. B. Both works use chiaroscuro the balance of light and shade in a work to represent light falling across a curved or rounded surface to create very realistic figures and forms in their compositions. But Tintoretto increases the use of contrast between highlights and shadows, which enhances the sense of drama. C. Tintoretto depicts Christ just as he offers his body and blood, in the form of bread and wine, to the disciples. Leonardo chose to depict Christ the moment he said "One of you will betray me." Leonardo chose a moment signifying death, Tintoretto a moment signifying life, depicted with in an atmosphere that is teeming with life. D. Leonardo's apostles seem posed for the occasion when contrasted with Tintoretto's spontaneously gesturing figures who look like they should move any moment. E. Both works have diagonals that lead toward a single horizon point and are balanced by strong horizontals and verticals in the architecture and figurial groupings, lending a feeling of Classical stability and predictability.

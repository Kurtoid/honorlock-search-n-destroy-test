Version control systems are used to keep track of file changes. Let us say that we are trying to build a new version control system called "GatorGit". An integral sub-component of this system is the diffchecker tool which compares the current file with the previous file version. For simplicity, lets consider all the files in the GatorGit system are documents represented by a Singly Linked List. Each line in the document is stored in one single node in the linked list and each line has at most n characters.  Each document has at most m lines. Different documents can have different number of lines.  In this problem, you are supposed to write code for a simple diff-checker tool. Write a function using pseudocode that takes in as input these two documents and prints the lines that differ across the two documents along with the corresponding line number. Your function takes as arguments  the head nodes of two documents, Doc1 and Doc2 implemented as a Singly Linked List. The function compares each line of the two documents in parallel, i.e. line by line. E.g. Line 1 of Doc1 is compared with Line 1 of Doc2; If the two lines differ, then print the two lines along with the corresponding line numbers otherwise move to the next line till you reach the end of the longer document. [5 points] Also, comment on the computational complexity of your function in the best and worst case in Big O notation. [2 points]   Another Example: Doc1Hello WorldThis is greatAwesomeDoc2Hello WorldThis is awfulAwesomeOutput2 This is great | This is awfulExplanation: Prints Line number, followed by Line in Document 1, followed by a separator '|', and then Line in Document 2 if the two lines don't match.

Consider the region R bounded by    a) Sketch a graph of the region R, and shade the region on your sketch, using your calculator as needed. Tell whether R is vertically simple, horizontally simple, both, or neither. b) Set up (but do NOT evaluate) a SINGLE INTEGRAL which represents the volume of the solid obtained by rotating R about the x-axis (y=0). Your answer will be ONE definite integral in one variable. c) Set up (but do NOT evaluate) a SINGLE INTEGRAL which represents the volume of the solid obtained by rotating R about the y-axis (x=0). Your answer will be ONE definite integral in one variable.

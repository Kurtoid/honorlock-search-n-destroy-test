[1]-Netflix's 2013 decision to release all 13-episodes in the first season of House of Cards at one time, instead of posting an episode per week, marked a new era of binge-watching streaming content. [2]-In 2015, "binge-watch" was declared the word of the year by Collins English Dictionary, which said use of the term had increased 200% in the prior year. [3]-73% of Americans admit to binge-watching, with the average binge lasting three hours and eight minutes. 90% of millennials and 87% of Gen Z stated they binge-watch, and 40% of those age groups binge-watch an average of six episodes of television in one sitting.[4]-The coronavirus pandemic led to a sharp increase in binge viewing: HBO, for example, saw a 65% jump in subscribers watching three or more episodes at once starting on Mar. 14, 2020, around the time when many states implemented stay-at-home measures to slow the spread of COVID-19.

In-text Source Information:Supporters argue that the flexibility of the format benefits students, particularly older ones who have full-time jobs or families. The ability to review materials such as past lectures online is also advantageous. Since students use the Internet in many other ways, it is logical for them to use it to attend school as well. Another advantage of distance learning is geographical, supporters assert. Students who are kept home most of the time due to illness or disability, as well as those living in geographically isolated areas, can all benefit from online education. The fact that students already use the Internet for other purposes makes online education an ideal format, proponents contend. Particularly among younger students, they say, being online is second nature. Supporters argue that students are often more comfortable, and therefore more engaged, reading lectures and making comments online than they would be in an actual classroom. "They're very much accustomed to using [the Internet] for recreation, for communication," says Liz Pape, chief executive officer of Massachusetts-based Virtual High School. "So now, if we train our teachers properly, they can use technology as a tool for delivering engaging information." Opponents argue that taking classes online deprives students of the full educational experience, which involves relating to other people in addition to absorbing information. In addition, some classes can be difficult to convert to an online format, both for instructors and for students. Another charge leveled at online education is that it has the potential to violate students' privacy. The Higher Education Act could encourage schools to require cameras and other monitoring devices in the homes of students to prevent cheating, they note. That highlights a central problem of verifying student honesty in distance learning, they say. Critics of distance learning also contend that there are major drawbacks to taking classes online. For one thing, they say, the courses require students to be self-motivated, making it less likely that many of them will receive the full benefit of the classes. For another, they add, online students miss out on some of the experiences of a traditional classroom. It is harder for students taking online courses to connect to teachers and other students, they argue. "People who are really behind this drive to online education don't realize that the education process is more about developing a relationship than about delivering the material," says Connel Fullenkamp, an associate professor of economics at Duke University in Durham, N.C.

Sports teams benefit schools by inspiring loyalty from students and alumni and, for successful programs, bringing in revenue for the school. Contrary to stereotypes, college athletes are vital and productive participants in college life. Sports help develop certain qualities, such as leadership, determination and perseverance, supporters say. Besides their obvious benefits to the student body, successful athletics programs benefit schools in other ways as well, supporters say. For one, a strong sports team, especially in high-profile sports, can boost a school's profile across the nation. For another, successful teams can often provide a financial boon for colleges and universities. "Moneymaking sports like men's football and basketball often underwrite other college athletic teams, from squash to soccer," Associated Press reporter Julia Silverman writes. "And universities say fancy stadiums, arenas and locker rooms help them recruit star athletes and attract fans and donors." Opponents argue that college athletics programs have become too commercialized and at odds with the educational values of the nation's schools. By devoting enormous attention and resources to sports, colleges and universities have neglected their academic mission. Whereas sports used to be just one aspect of the collegiate experience, critics say, it has now become the focus of school life and policies on many campuses. Nowadays, they say, athletics programs, particularly at big, Division I schools, have become almost professional operations that have little to do with the schools they represent. "The role of athletics at colleges and universities across the country does seem to be out of balance," claims Christopher Thomforde, president of St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn. "The model of professional athletics and NCAA Division I athletics, especially football and basketball, is based upon an entertainment/celebrity model and not a model that relates directly to the educational mission and purpose of higher education."

SCENARIO: ACME Health is an Alabama based manufacturer specializing in innovative devices for the health care industry.  ACME is looking to improve the application of it's angioplasty balloons used to clear blocked arteries.  Feedback from their customers (cardiologists, nurses, hospital administrators, etc.), indicate that there exists a need to minimize re-occurrence of blockages after angioplasty surgery. The ACME team developed a concept for a mechanical device that would be permanently inserted into a patient's blocked artery during the angioplasty procedure.  ACME expects this new product concept to fit nicely within it's current product portfolio while targeting existing customer segments. ACME has completed a preliminary patent search and found several idea concepts similar to ACME's idea that have been patented or applied for patent protection. .  ACME can work around these patents but will not be able to limit competitors entry into the market.  The proposed stated concept will require special materials and development of a surgical insertion process.  This new device is not similar to any of the other ACME products currently produced and will require extensive development of new manufacturing processes.  The development costs for this ground breaking device will also require a large development expense commitment in order to meet the stringent regulatory requirements for medical devices.  As with any new medical devices, the high liability risk will require extensive R&D and product reliability and product use testing. ACME senior management recognize the high reward opportunity and have a strong desire to bring a successful new-to-the-world product to market will enable them to maintain their market leadership position.  However, with limited capital available to invest and the high risk of a new-to-the-world product, the senior management team requires a 1st pass screening to be completed. Q5 - Read the following new product concept overview (above) and then match each of the 7 "1st pass screen" questions (below and on the left) to the appropriate statements extracted from the narrative: (21points)

In a file server, the following steps have to be performed on each request: (1) parse request, (2) find and read file, (3) respond with file or error message. Assume steps (1) and (3) take 1ms and step (2) takes 2ms. Assume any delays due to inter-thread communication, synchronization, context-switching, etc. are negligible. Assume you have infinite resources. Consider a boss-worker and a pipelined model designs, each with a total of 4 threads. In both cases, you need to process a total of 6 requests. Answer the questions below. Please try to follow these rules:- Do not write the units. - Do not use a comma in your answer (e.g., write 1000 instead of 1,000 or write 0.75 instead of 0,75). - Write the leading zero in decimal fractions (e.g., write 0.75 instead of .75)- Show the results with up to two decimal places. Questions:For the boss-worker model, where the boss simply accepts requests and passes them onto a shared workers' queue: a) How many requests can be processed concurrently? [a] b) How long does it take to process a total of 6 requests in ms? [b]ms c) What is the average throughput for this workload, in req/ms? [c]req/ms d) What is the average response time for this workload, in ms? [d]ms For a balanced implementation of the pipeline model: e) How many threads are allocated to the first stage? [e] f) How many threads are allocated to the second stage? [f] g) How many requests are concurrently being processed? [g] h) How long does it take to process a total of 6 requests in ms? [h]ms i) What is the average throughput for this workload, req/ms? [i]req/ms j) What is the average response time for this workload, in ms? [j]ms

Zouar Computer Corporation currently manufactures the disk drives that it uses in its computers. The costs to produce 5,000 of these disk drives last year were as follows:        Cost per drive   Direct materials $ 12     Direct labor   2     Variable manufacturing overhead   5     Fixed manufacturing overhead   7     Total $ 26           Kidal Electronics has offered to provide Zouar with all of its disk drive needs for $27 per drive.

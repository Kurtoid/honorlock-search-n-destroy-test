The Orphan Hermit received a "Tax Day" gift from Hermione, a copy of Dancing Naked in the Mind Field, a book written in 1998 by Kary Mullis, the developer of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR, central to sequencing DNA) and winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  Orphy was fascinated to read on the cover the description of Dr. Mullis as "the world's most eccentric Nobel-Prize winning scientist".  Orphy learned that the Thermus aquaticus, the thermophile bacterium that produced the Taq polymerase enzyme critical to PCR was first discovered in a small geothermally heated 70oC+ spring near the Great Fountain Geyser in Yellowstone National Park!  Orphy also read that scientists had thought that no life could exist at temperature above 70oC because enzymes and other proteins were denatured at these temperatures (that is, they lose their secondary, tertiary, and/or quaternary structure at these temperatures), although they don't lose their primary structure (that is, the amide or peptide bonds between the individual amino acids).  Orphy recalled from CHM 2051 the two amino acids cysteine and leucine (he drew the structures below, and then used R1 and R2 to symbolize the amino acid sidechains):  cysteine:   leucine:    Help Orphy predict the products of the chemical reaction between cysteine and leucine to form the dipeptide leucyl-cysteine:                   cysteine          +           leucine                   -              leucyl-cysteine  +   ?   A.      B.      C.      D.

A 90-year-old female, a resident of a long-term care facility, was admitted to the hospital with a severe decubitus ulcer on the right buttock described as a stage III pressure ulcer. The patient also had a small chronic ulcer on the right heel, currently limited to the skin. The patient also has generalized atherosclerosis of both extremities. Treatments of the skin conditions were an excisional debridement of the skin of the heel and an excisional debridement into the muscle of the buttock. The wound care nurse closely monitored the patient after surgery and gave detailed instructions to the nurses at the long-term care facility who would be taking care of the patient after discharge. The patient was transferred back to the long-term care facility. The wound care physician and nurse would visit the patient in the long-term care facility within one week to monitor the healing of the pressure and chronic ulcers.

Dr. Potter wants to estimate the time spent studying for all students at Flagler College.  He takes a random sample of 24 Flagler College students and records the number of hours they spend studying per week.  He finds the sample distribution is strongly skewed to the right, but that the log transformation of the data is approximately normal.  The 95% confidence interval for estimating the population mean is (14.94, 18.56) and the 95% confidence interval for estimating the mean of the  log-transformed times is (1.17, 1.26) (a)  Convert the log interval boundaries back to units of hours and report the 95% confidence interval for estimating the geometric mean.  (Round to two decimals.) [answer1] (b) Correctly interpret the resulting confidence interval. [answer2] (c) Which interval would you  report: the interval for the population mean or for the population geometric  mean? Explain. Choose the correct answer below. [answer3]

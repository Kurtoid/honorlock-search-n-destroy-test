It was not until after World War II that most Southerners felt the impact of air conditioning. As one historian on the subject commented, "The air conditioner came to the South in a series of waves, and only with the wave of the 1950s was the region truly engulfed."

"The South of the 1970s could claim air-conditioned shopping malls, domed stadiums, dugouts, greenhouses, grain elevators, chicken coops, aircraft hangers, crane cabs, off-shore oil rigs, cattle barns, steel mills, and drive-in movies and restaurants," wrote one historian.

Problem No. 2 Shown below is a diving board that is supported by springs at A and B.   A boy with a mass of 60-kg stands at the free end of the board as shown. The spring constant (stiffness) of both springs k=60 kN/m. The board is assumed to be rigid, i.e. it remain straight at all times (does not curve).

Based on this information answer the following question: Question 2.1: What is the force exerted by the boy on the diving board when standing still? [Enter value in N, upwards as positive]

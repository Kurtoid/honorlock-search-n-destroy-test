Review each case and indicate the correct code.    Preoperative and postoperative diagnosis: Bilateral breast hypoplasia and symmetry Operation performed: Bilateral augmentation mammoplasty The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, and then general anesthesia was achieved. Local infiltration with 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,00 dilution of epinephrine was performed. On the right breast, using a #15 blade, an inframammary incision was made and carried through the skin and subcutaneous issue. A Bovie electrocautery dissection was completed down to the pectoralis muscle, and a submuscular pocket was created. Saline was used to irrigate the site. Hemostasis was achieved. The same procedure then was completed on the left breast, with dissection performed in a symmetric fashion to recreate a submuscular pocket. Two implants were inspected, and they were placed in the submuscular pockets. Additional dissection was performed on the left side to achieve symmetry. 3-0 Vicryl sutures were used to close the muscle layer. The subcutaneous deep dermal layer was then closed with 3-0 Vicryl sutures and the subcuticular with 4-0 Vicryl sutures. The wounds were dressed, and a Velcro breast band was placed on the superior aspect of the breast. After extubating the patient, she was sent to recovery in stable condition.

31.  The nurse is taking care of a patient on telemetry and notes the the following on the telemetry monitor.    The nurse knows to do the following:
The FBI develops a computer program known as a "worm" program. It is designed to infiltrate any computer using a web browser or any other software to interact with a government computer, without the knowledge of the comput's owner. Once the worm program arrives on the us's computer, it locates any documents stored on the computer that are classified for national security purposes. It is a crime for an unauthorized person to possess classified national security documents. If such documents are present on the us's computer, the program sends out a message to notify authorities. If such documents are not present, the worm program erases itself and the user never knows that it was present on the computer. If the FBI disseminates this worm program as broadly as possible, does its use violate the constitution?

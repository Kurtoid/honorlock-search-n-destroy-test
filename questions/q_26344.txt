Which of the following metrics is best at capturing the degree to which the company is successful in eliciting social interaction through its Facebook page?
The definition of the term "real property" includes all of the following EXCEPT:
Ordered pair data for a sample of 6 houses was analyzed using least squares regression. X represents the square footage of each house, the smallest having 1,096 square feet and the largest having 1,544 square feet. Y represents the asking price of each house, in thousands of dollars. The least squares regression equation for this data is y = 87.63 + 0.06x.   Use this information to calculate the predicted asking price, in dollars, for a house having 1200 square feet.

Hayes, T.B., Khoury, V., Narayan, A., Nazir, M., Park, A., Brown, T., dame, L., Chan, E., Buchholz, D., Stueve, T., & Gallipeau, S.  (2010).  Atrazine induces complete feminization and chemical castration in male African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), Proceedings from the National Academy of Science, online early version, 1-6.      doi/10.1073/pnas.0909519107 The herbicide atrazine is one of the most commonly applied pesticides in the world. As a result, atrazine is the most commonly detected pesticide contaminant of ground, surface, and drinking water. Atrazine is also a potent endocrine disruptor that is active at low, ecologically relevant concentrations. Previous studies showed that atrazine adversely affects amphibian larval development. The present study demonstrates the reproductive consequences of atrazine exposure in adult amphibians. Atrazine-exposed males were both demasculinized (chemically castrated) and completely feminized as adults. Ten percent of the exposed genetic males developed into functional females that copulated with unexposed males and produced viable eggs. Atrazine- exposed males suffered from depressed testosterone, decreased breeding gland size, demasculinized/feminized laryngeal development, suppressed mating behavior, reduced spermatogenesis, and decreased fertility. These data are consistent with effects of atrazine observed in other vertebrate classes. The present findings exemplify the role that atrazine and other endocrine-disrupting pesticides likely play in global amphibian declines. In this study, what was the independent variable (IV)?

With a P controller, which of the following systems will result in no steady-state error?
The following experiment has been conducted: Two cell lines have been created such that each cell line expresses an integral membrane protein that can be labeled with fluorescent markers. Cell line A has a blue marker on its surface (1) Cell line B has a red marker on its surface (2) Cells A and Cell B in culture are allowed to come in contact and stimulated to fuse (3) to form a hybrid cell (4). After some time, the distribution of the A and B markers is shown to be randomized in the hybrid cell (5).  Changing which of the following parameters of the cell culture would shorten the time to form the arrangement in (5) (i.e. shorten time from 4 to 5)?

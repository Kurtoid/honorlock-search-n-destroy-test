22. The quality of the materials for a building construction and the level of the maintenance play an important role in prolonging the economic life of a building and thus impact the value of the building. Buildings A and B on the same lot (they are next to each other) were constructed in the same year. Building A was constructed using materials of poor quality and has been poorly maintained, while building B was constructed using good-quality materials and maintained well. Considering the potential difference in effective age between these two buildings, which building would probably have a higher value keeping others the same?

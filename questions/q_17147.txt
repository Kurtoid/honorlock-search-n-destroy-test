After reading the paragraph below, answer the questions that follow.Desert pupfish live in springs of the American Southwest.

As the large lakes dried up, small groups of pupfish remained in springs and pools fed by groundwater seepage. Now, although many of these small springs still have pupfish, each population, through evolution, has become very different from populations of pupfish in other springs.Which of the following statements represents a probable explanation for differences among pupfish populations?

Gerontologists suggest 4 factors related to successful retirement. What are they?
A researcher investigated the effect of municipal receipts of taxes and fees (R) and central government grants (G) on the local government spending (S). For this, s/he collected a panel data set for t=1983,1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987 and for 265 municipalities. Then, s/he estimated a static panel data model based on the pooled ordinary least squares (POLS), random effects (RE), fixed effects (FE), and first-differenced (FD) estimators and also got the following test results. Answer the Questions 6-7 based on these test results.
An object slides on a level floor. It slows and comes to a stop with a constant acceleration of magnitude 2.4 m/s2. What is the coefficient of kinetic friction between the object and the floor?
If your research assistants are evaluating the study's dependent variable and are improperly trained, what threat to internal validity might you worry about?
Flo's Coffee Shop recently experimented with adding scented candles to the tables in the shop. In week 1 Flo placed flowery scented lit candles on all tables. In week 2 she placed cinnamon scented lit candles on all tables. Flo noticed that more customers lingered in the coffee shop and made more purchases in week 2 than in week 1. This effect is BEST explained by:

Fill in each blank with correct choice within each set of parentheses: In the acronym XPS, the P stands for (photoelectron / proton / power) [1].  This technique irradiates a sample with (hard / soft) [2] X-rays, which knocks off electrons of lower atomic (incident / kinetic / binding) [3] energy. The value that is desired is the binding energy because it is a characteristic of each element, and thus provides chemical information. But it is not directly measured.  It is obtained from the difference between the incident energy, that of the X-ray source, and the kinetic energy, measured from the (drag / velocity / acceleration) [4] of the released electrons that travel through hemispherical metal plates.  The reason this is a surface analysis technique is because the escape depth of the electrons is short, where the electrons lose energy due to (elastic / inelastic) [5] scattering collisions with other matter in their path.  Therefore, only elements in the uppermost one hundred (angstroms / nanometers / microns / millimeters) [6] are seen in the spectrum. Because the peak intensities are not directly related to the electron occupancy of orbitals, (fudge / transition / sensitivity) [7] factors must be used to make the technique semi-quantitative with respect to measuring elemental composition. This leads to the other name of the technique, given the acronym (ECSA / EASC / ESCA / SCEA / AESC) [8].  In high resolution XPS, one can gain information about the bonding environment of that specific element because the binding energies become higher for an atom that has a bonding environment with a (lower / higher) [9] oxidation state. For example, in the case of organic polymers, one can distinguish between an ester and an ether, where the latter functional group will have a (lower / higher) [10] binding energy.  Depth profiling can be done in XPS by varying the (take-on / take-off  / rip-off / scattering) [11] angle to the detector, which in turn varies the escape path length. To get more surface sensitivity (shallowest depth measurement), one should use a (smaller / larger) [12] emission angle (angle between surface and detector).  Very low emission angles are referred to as (phasing / browsing / grazing / skimming) [13] incidence measurements.

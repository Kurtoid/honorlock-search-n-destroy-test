Use this scenario to answer the questions.A renewable alternative to fossil fuels are biofuels. Scientists are searching for the best plants to use as a source of biofuels. Plant sugars can be fermented into ethanol, and then used as an additive to gasoline. Although it is relatively easy to obtain ethanol in this way, this type of ethanol production competes with the need to produce food. Alternatively, biofuels can be fermented from other plant carbohydrates, such as the cellulose in plant cell walls. This is called cellulosic ethanol production. Cellulases are enzymes that are used to break down cellulose. Per unit of mass, which type of cell requires the LEAST amount of cellulase to decompose cell walls?

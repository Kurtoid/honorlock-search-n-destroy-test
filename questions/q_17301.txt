Consider the different scheduling algorithms described in the Cache Affinity paper. Given the two different graphs from the paper shown below, why is it that Last Processor (LP), shown with the dark dashed lines in the graphs, is closer to First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) in one case (top graph), and to Fixed Processor (FP) in the other (bottom graph). FCFS and FP are shown with solid dark lines. The graphs illustrate the change in the system throughput (on the y-axis) as a function of the normalized cache footprint of the task (on the x-axis), for two different scenarios: with 48 tasks (top graph) and with 128 tasks total (bottom graph). In both cases, the results were obtained on a machine with 32 processors. You should ignore the thin dotted lines, which correspond to the case when the authors are also modeling interference effects.

Draw expanded structural formulas for the following organic compounds.  If you prefer, you can use hash marks (lines) to indicate the hydrogen in each. Draw your structures on a separate sheet of paper and immediately after submitting the exam, take a picture of your work and upload it into the Final Exam Pictures link located in Final Exam module in Canvas. Please make sure to number each structure.  1)   2,3,3-trimethyl-1-hexene 2)  3-ethyloctane 3)  CH3(CH2)5CH3 4)  Draw a structural isomer of pentane (must be a compound other than pentane) and Correctly name the compound that you draw.

Extra credit.  The 4 choices below show the genotypes of 4 individuals relative to 4 genes.  The "A gene" and the "B gene" shows complete dominance.  The "R gene" shows incomplete dominance.  The "T gene" is an X-linked gene.  Each gene influences only one trait, so there is no polygenic inheritance.      Genotype of individual 1: AA bb R3R4 XTY      Genotype of individual 2: aa Bb R3R5 XTXt      Genotype of individual 3: AA BB R1R1 XTXT      Genotype of individual 4: Aa BB R5R6 XtY Carefully examine these genotypes.  Which of the genes is multialleleic?  Select all correct choices.

In a patient with abdominal pain, assessment of the abdomen should be performed in the following order:
Device Family: MAX 10 (DA/DF/DC/SA/SC)Device: 10M02SCU169C8G Design, construct, and demonstrate the circuits that meets the following specifications. Use the switches, LEDs, and resistors needed to create the necessary inputs and outputs for your demonstration.  Use only your PLD, i.e., no 74'xxx chips.  Inputs: Start(L), Hold(H), CLK Outputs: Active-high count values and Special(L) DAD: NOT allowed  Description: Design a state machine (counter) to count through the following sequence 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, ... .  If Hold(H) is true, the counting should pause; if hold is false, the counting should continue. Special(L) should be true only if the count is 1 and Hold is true. Start(L), must asynchronously force the counter to the count value of 1.  Design a next state truth for the described state machine. Use any of the standard flip-flops. If necessary, design a voltage table for the described state machine. Design the entire circuit in Quartus. Simulate the design in Quartus. Program the PLD (using the pof, not sof). Then remove power by disconnecting the two devices from your USB ports. Design the necessary switch and LED circuits on your breadboard.  Make a legend indicating the true positions of the switch(es), as you did in lab. Make a legend for the LEDs to indicate which LEDs correspond to which signals, as you did in lab.   Connect the necessary switch and LED circuits to the PLD. Restore the PLD's USB cable to your computer to power your circuits. Verify to yourself that your circuit is functioning properly. Archive this Quartus project and submit it as part of this practical, as described below. Use CamScanner (or equivalent), as described below, to make a pdf file to submit as part of this practical.  Demonstration  You will show your Quartus simulation to match the appropriate table. You will demonstrate the proper functioning of your circuit.  You will have only ONE chance to demo your work.  If you think you are ready, read the question again to be sure that you completed ALL parts of this practical. Do not ask us for any feedback on your design until it is complete and ready to be graded. Be prepared to run your design, as instructed, by Dr. Schwartz or a PI. Also, be prepared to show your design and simulation (in Quartus). Use Zoom's chat to tell your PI that you are ready by sending READY. Again, you will NOT be told anything about how you did, but grades will be posted ASAP.  You MUST complete the two file uploads (see below) before the end of your practical. If you have not already done so, when there is five minutes remaining in your practical, you should stop working and start this process. You must archive your Quartus design and upload it (in the next problem). In the last problem, you must upload a single pdf file (use CamScanner or equivalent) containing a clear picture of your breadboard that shows your circuit (as well as switch and LED legends) and also contains clear pictures of your scratch paper, showing truth and voltage tables, if any. Failure to upload these files before the end of the Practical will result in a grade of zero.

Which one of the diagrams below would be best for representing a systems function?
Sven hires Gina to build an addition on his house. The contract states that Gina is an independent contractor. Gina has no experience in building. She will work for an hourly wage of $35 per hour. Sven will provide the tools for her to complete the job. Sven will direct her as to how to complete the work and give her the knowledge and insight required to do the job. Sven is a contractor, but wants to avoid the liability that comes from having employees. As Gina is placing a board on the house in a careless manner, it falls and kills Sven's friend Bob. Gina has no assets, but Sven owns several homes and businesses. Bob's family is sad and mad wants to sue someone for damages for the death of Bob because money always makes people feel better. Who will they likely choose to sue and why?

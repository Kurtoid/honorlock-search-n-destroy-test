In the US, getting a driver's license has long been considered a rite of passage for teenagers, but this generation is waiting longer to do it. Some teens claim they can get around fine without a license, others cite the high cost of driving, and others say social media makes it easy to interact with friends without leaving home. Even though younger drivers have the highest rates of accidents, waiting to drive until you are older does not inherently make you a safer driver. The graduated licensing process that requires 15-17 year olds to drive with certain restrictions and adult supervision for their first year does not apply after age 18, which means older new licensees might be more inexperienced than younger ones. Match each of the five situations below with the parameter of interest - you should use each one only once.  In their first year of driving, one in five 16-year-old drivers has an accident. [oneprop] Nowadays only around 60 percent of those between the ages of 17 and 19 are licensed to drive, compared to 80 percent of teens back in the 1980's. [twoprop] For the average family, adding a teen driver almost doubles their car insurance rates. [matchedpairs] The average cost of insuring a teen driver is considerably lower for females than males. [twomeans] In other countries people start driving at a much older age. In the UK, the average age for new drivers is 26. [onemean]

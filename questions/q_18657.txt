A college entrance exam company determined that a score of 21 on the mathematics portion of the exam suggests that a student is ready for  college-level mathematics. To achieve this  goal, the company recommends that students take a core curriculum of math courses in high school. Suppose a random sample of 150 students who completed this core set of courses results in a mean math score of 21.4 on the college entrance exam with a standard deviation of 4.2. Using a 0.10 level of significance, do these results suggest that students who complete the core curriculum are ready for  college-level mathematics? That  is, are they scoring above 21 on the math portion of the  exam?   List the hypotheses, the critical value(s), the test value (test statistic) and briefly (1-2 sentences) explain why the results do or do not suggest that students who complete the core curriculum are ready for college-level mathematics.

DOCUMENTATION Below, some relevant documentation is provided through both external and internal links. The external links are meant to provide access to a more complete version of the relevant documentation, whereas the internal links are meant to provide access to a minimal amount of documentation, so that the relevant content may hopefully be loaded more quickly. (Also, it was not possible to provide a reliable external link for some documentation. For such documentation, an internal link is provided.) When accessing documentation via an external link, another tab should be opened within your web browser. It is likely that you will need to use a keyboard shortcut to switch between multiple open tabs. The keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+Tab" should rotate the active tab to the right, and "Ctrl+Shift+Tab" should rotate the active tab to the left. If these keyboard shortcuts do not work for you, contact some relevant course staff member(s). When accessing documentation via an internal link, select the down arrow () and then select "Preview".  To search for some keyword within some document, select anything within the relevant window and type "Ctrl+f" (or "Cmd+f", if MacOS is utilized) on the connected keyboard.

A student obtains the following data by following an experimental procedure to produce hydrogen gas from a reaction of Mg metal reacting with hydrochloric acid. Based on this data, answer the questions below.  Use 273 for the temperature conversion. Molar mass of Mg is 24.31 g/mol. Mg + 2 HCl --> MgCl2 +  H2  Pressure of dry H2 = 739 torr Temperature = 21 degrees C Mass of Mg used = 0.041 g Volume of H2 = 43.65 mL (already corrected for calibration of eudiometer tube) 1) How many moles of H2 were produced from 0.0411 g of Mg? (Keep 3 sig. fig. in answer; do not use scientific notation) 2) Calculate the R constant based upon this information. You should end up in (L x torr)(moles x K){"version":"1.1","math":"(L x torr)(moles x K)"} (do not write the unit in the answer)

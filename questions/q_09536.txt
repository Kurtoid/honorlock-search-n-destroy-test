Label this question Q-XY (8 min) You must show all your work for this problem on your paper.  You must show starting variables, starting equations, and use one step equation dimensional analysis where applicable.  In addition to showing you work on paper, you must state you final answer(s) here with units.  Failure to do so will result in zero credit regardless of your work on paper. R = 8.314 J/mol K F = 96, 500 J/V mol Consider the reaction: X2 (g) +  Y2 (g) -  2 XY (g) A) Calculate Kp for this reaction if DG* = -5.49 kJ/mol at 298K.. B) If the partial pressures of the initial mixture are P (XY) = 0.22 atm, P (X2) = 0.35 atm, and P (Y2) = 0.31 atm, calculate DG for the reaction at 298K.  C)  Is the reaction at equilibrium?  If not, in which direction does it need to proceed to reach equilibrium? Place your final answers for A-C here with the appropriate letter.

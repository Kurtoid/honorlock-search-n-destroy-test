Cinder is an 8 month old Husky who was recently purchased from a sled dog kennel as an addition to a small but high end quality racing team.  On Monday, when Cinder's new owner picked her up, the kennel owner informed her that on Sunday there had been a tie between Cinder and an intact male who was in the same run.  The kennel owner did not believe that Cinder was in estrus as she had not shown any signs of coming into heat (vulva did not seem swollen, no blood observed)  and speculated that the male had bred her because a different bitch was in heat a few kennels over. The new owner most certainly did not want Cinder to be pregnant, so on Tuesday she started preparing vaginal smears to see where Cinder was in her cycle. The smears are pictured here. So, here is the question: What are the chances that Cinder became pregnant?  Assume the male is fertile.  Base your answer on when she was bred relative to the progression of the vaginal cytological changes.  Remember that the breeding took place on Sunday, two days before the first vaginal smear. Be specific in your answer using facts and data you know.

Use the figure to answer the following question.The figure proposes a combination of a top-down and bottom-up model (a hypothesis) to describe the variable effects of biological control herbivores on the fitness of an invasive plant, spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe). Researchers transported and released several insect species from the plant's native range in Europe in an attempt to reduce densities of this non-native weed in the United States. The y-axis shows C. stoebe plant fitness, and the x-axis represents the intensity of herbivory by the insects, from low to high. As the vertical shaded bar is moved along the x-axis, the ultimate effect of herbivory (now A, B, and C) on plant fitness can change based on its intensity and the other factors. The horizontal dashed line represents no predicted change in fitness under the effects of varying intensity of herbivory, plant competition, and soil resources available to the plant (such as nitrogen or water), while the three solid lines represent other possible outcomes.(D.G. Knochel and T.R. Seastedt, Reconciling contradictory findings of herbivore impacts on spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) growth and reproduction, Ecological Applications 20(7):1903-1912 [2011].)What portion of the model would be characterized as bottom-up?

A 9-year-old boy was referred by his dermatologist for a lipid evaluation after the boy developed what appeared to be a raised yellowish rash over his palms and elbows. The boy had no previous history of heart problems and no family history of any coronary disorders. However, when he was 8, he did have two acute attacks of pancreatitis and abdominal pain. His lipid workup is as follows (specimen was a fasting blood draw): triglyceride 3200 mg/dL (normal

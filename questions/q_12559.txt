Jill is a 16-year-old girl. Her parents brought her to therapy because they despaired for several years that her insistence that she was a boy. She wanted to dress in boy's attire and begin masculinizing hormone treatments. What they thought would be a passing whim, over the years, they now realize was a deeply set conviction. At approximately age 3, Jill began showing a greater interest in playing with the toys that her brother, older by 7 years, had used: cars, trucks, soldiers, swords and so on. She was uninterested in the girl-typical toys such as dolls, house items, and stuffed animals, which her parents kept buying for her. At age 4, she declared that she was a boy; any attempt of telling her otherwise was met by crying protests. In kindergarten, at age 5, Jill much preferred the company of boys with whom she would engage in competitive body-contact games. At girls' social gatherings she kept apart, choosing aloneness rather than joining in games and other activities. She would ask, "Where the other boys? Why am I the only one here?" For school she insisted on wearing boyish clothes, resisting more typically feminine ones. At around age 7, her favorite movies and TV shows involved some young male hero or boy-centered story with which she would identify. As Jill entered puberty, she found herself isolating more and more. She did not fit anywhere. Girls found her "strange," thus the avoidance was mutual, whereas boys tended to ignore her or tease her for being "weird." Jill felt it was a tragedy not to have a penis; she hated the emergence of her breasts, which she would flatten with cloth straps. Jill was sexually and emotionally attracted to girls and thought of herself as heterosexual. When her menarche occurred at age 14, she cried for days, experiencing then for the first time a 3-month-long depressive episode. Based on the information available, what is the most appropriate diagnosis, if any?

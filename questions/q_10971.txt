A distribution center serves [n] local stores. During any day each store independently will request a resupply of a certain product with probability [x]. When a resupply is requested, the distribution center will be able to fulfill it on the next day with probability [y] independently of any other requests. If fulfillment is unsuccessful in the first attempt, resupply will be completed the day after. Suppose that the distribution has capacity to resupply any number of stores at the same time.   Model the system as a Markov chain.  Write down the equations to determine the long-run proportions. Solve the equations. You should have an easy way to solve the equations. Think carefully, which equations to chose for your system! Find the average number of stores that are waiting for resupply on any given day.

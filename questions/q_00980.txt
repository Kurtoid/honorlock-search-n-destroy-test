Use the Gauss-Seidel Method to solve the equations below with an initial guess of x1 = x2 = x3 = -10. These equations have been transferred to their augmented matrix form on the "Final-Q7" tab. 0.1x1 + 7x2 - 0.3x3 = -19.3 0.3x1 - 0.2x2 + 10x3 = 71.4 3x1 - 0.1x2 - 0.2x3 = 7.85 On the "Exam2-Q7" tab, please solve this SLAE using the Gauss-Seidel Method in fifteen (15) iterations. Note: This is an Excel spreadsheet problem and no programming is required. Once complete, please type a one-word essay (e.g., "ok") for this question and then upload your combined Excel file at the very end of this exam.

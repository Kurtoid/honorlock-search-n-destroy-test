Use the following base sequence of one strand of an imaginary DNA molecule: TACTTGAGCTTTAGCATC Step 1. Write the base sequence for an mRNA strand that would be transcribed from the given DNA sequence above.  Place your results in the data table below.
 Step 2. Use the Genetic Code shown below the table to determine the sequence of amino acids in the resulting protein. Place your results in the data table.
 Use the three letter abbreviation for each amino acid and separate them by a comma. Step 3. If an C was added to the original DNA strand after the third base, the DNA sequence would now be: TACCTTGAGCTTTAGCATC. What would the resulting mRNA look like? Place your results in the table below. Step 4. Use the attached Genetic Code to determine the sequence of amino acids in the resulting protein from the changed sequence in Step 3. Place your results in the table. Use the three letter abbreviation for each amino acid and separate them by a comma.    mRNA from Step 1 [a]   Amino acid sequence from Step 2 [b]   mRNA from Step 3 [c]   Amino acid sequence from Step 4 [d]

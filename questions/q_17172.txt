The researchers studied the microorganisms in the skin swab samples by growing them in the lab AND by extracting DNA from the microorganisms. Some of the people the researchers sampled were farmers that raised cows and worked in agricultural fields with manure. Within the swab samples collected from these individuals the researchers were able to grow a microorganism in the laboratory that thrived without oxygen, and produced methane. They were able to isolate the organism, so that it was grew in pure culture, without any other microorganisms. When the researcher was able to view the microorganism with electron microscopy they found that the lipid bilayer was comprised of ether-linked lipids. How would you classify this organism?

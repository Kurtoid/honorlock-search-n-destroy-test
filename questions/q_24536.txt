The figure below shows two views of the same wire loop between the poles of a magnet. The first view is the overhead view and we see the full loop along with all its segments and the battery driving the current in the loop. The second view is a side view looking on from the direction indicated by the black arrow. We can see in this figure that the loop is not orientated horizontally as it appears to be in the overhead view. If a current I is flowing in the loop, in which direction will the loop be rotating at the time shown in the side view?      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

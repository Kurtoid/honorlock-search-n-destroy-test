The teachers at a local high school were surveyed. Two of the variables recorded for the 150 teachers were housing status and length of service. Housing status was recorded as owning or renting your residence, while length of service was classified as a new teacher (less than 5 years of service) or as an experienced teacher (at least 5 years of service). The following table summarizes the responses.             Housing status                 Own   Rent   Total     Experience   New teacher   5   25   30     Experienced teacher   75   45   120         Total   80   70   150     Based on the responses, what is the probability that a randomly selected teacher from this school is a teacher who has less than 5 years of teaching experience?

Type II restriction endonucleases (EcoRI, EcoRV, etc.) are metal-dependent enzymes (often using Mg++) that use a metal-bound hydroxide (like carbonic anhydrase) to attack a phosphodiester bond. Interestingly, in the absence of DNA, isolated endonucleases do not contain metal. Based upon these observations, describe the catalytic mechanism for these endonucleases.

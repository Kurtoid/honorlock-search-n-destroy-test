Student Honor Code As a student at the University of Florida, you are to adhere to the Student Honor Code. "Any individual who becomes aware of a violation of the Honor Code is bound by honor to take corrective action." As Section 3c states "A student shall not collaborate or consult with another person on ANY academic activity unless the student has the express authorization from the faculty member." This includes collaborating when not authorized to do so on an examination, take-home test, etc. With that said, you are to take this exam INDIVIDUALLY. Taking the exam in pairs or groups either at the same time, one after the other, or receiving any help is considered cheating - as is sharing information about the exam with students who have not yet taken the exam. We will bring it up to Student Honor Court if we suspect (and confirm) that any cheating was involved when taking this exam.

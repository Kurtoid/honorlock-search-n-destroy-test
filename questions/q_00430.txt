WORKOUT PROBLEM starts here: (Nothing to submit here, just read the problem. Some of the homework format/layout is already provided)    Given: A spring, with a spring constant k = 75 N/m, has an equilibrium (relaxed) length of 1.00 m. The spring is compressed to a length of 0.50 m and a mass of 2.0 kg is placed at its free end on a frictionless slope which makes an angle of 41 degrees with respect to the horizontal as shown in the figure below. The spring is then released. Assume the incline surface is long enough that the mass never falls off the end of the ramp.    Find:    Find the speed of the mass when the spring reaches the relaxed position. If the mass IS attached to the spring, find the maximum stretch (x3 on the figure) of the spring. If the mass is NOT attached to the spring, how much farther would the mass move than it did in part (b) before coming to rest?    Figure:

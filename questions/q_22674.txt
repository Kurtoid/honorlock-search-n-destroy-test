In a certain fruit fly species, wing shape is determined by a single gene with two alleles: (S) for straight wings, which is completely dominant to (s) for curly wings.  In turn, eye shape is determined by a single gene with two alleles: (R) for round eyes, which is completely dominant to (r) for triangular eyes.  The two genes are linked to the same autosome.  A cis dihybrid male fly (S s R r) is test crossed and the following progeny are obtained.

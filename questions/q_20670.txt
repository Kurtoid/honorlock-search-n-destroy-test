Consider a doubly linked list specified as follows: public class MyList {    private MyNode head;    private MyNode tail;    private class MyNode {         private Object payload;         private MyNode next;  // null if the last node         private MyNode prev; // null if the first node    }    ...}  Write a method private void moveToFront(Node p) for class MyList that would move an existing node p from its current position in the list to the beginning of the list. For simplicity, assume that you do not need to check if node p indeed belongs to the list. (3 pts) What is the running time of your method expressed in the big-O notation? (1 pt)
In this question, n! denote the factorial of n, where n is any non-negative integer. Consider the trailing zeros of factorials in binary representation. For example, in binary representation, 110! = 1*10*11*100*101*110=1011010000, which has four trailing zeros. This corresponds to 6!=1*2*3*4*5*6=720 in decimal representation.   In binary representation, the number of trailing zeros of   is []

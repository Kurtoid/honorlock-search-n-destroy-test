Shown below is an excerpt from an article on Phys.org, written in 2019.  Read it, then answer the questions that follow. Bacteria that oxidizes methane found in common soilby Bob Yirka , Phys.org A team of researchers has found a kind of bacterium that oxidizes methane (chemical formula: CH4). In their paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the group suggests that their work could lead to progress in combating global warming. Scientists have reached consensus that global warming is happening, and that it is because humans continue to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The main culprit is carbon dioxide, but there are other greenhouse gases making their way into the atmosphere, as well--one of them is methane. Humans produce methane naturally, via flatulence, as do animals. It also results from production of rice and other crops.  It is also released it during oil extraction. To combat global warming, we need to find a way to stop emitting methane, or find a way to remove it. In this new effort, the researchers report a natural way to remove methane from the air by supporting a type of bacteria that oxidizes it. Scientists have suspected for many years that one or more types of bacteria oxidize methane because testing has shown that methane levels drop in places where there is soil present. The researchers report that they have isolated a type of bacteria that lives in soil and oxidizes methane: Methylocapsa gorgona. It is very common and is found all around the globe. It can also live on very low concentrations of the gas. On the downside, the researchers found that it is also quite fragile, and activities like farming can kill it. Question: Based on the information provided in the article, you can deduce that M. gorgona is a(n)...

Step 1.  Let a = rho * SQRT(  a1 * a2 ) with a1 and a2 being the shape parameters and b1 and b2  being the scale parameters   Step 2.  X1 = Random.Gamma( a1-a, 1 ) Step 3.  X2 = Random.Gamma( a2-a, 1 ) Step 4.  X3 = Random.Gamma( a, 1 ) Step 5.  Let Y1 = b1 (X1 + X3 ) and Y2 = b2 (X2 + X3 ). 5.  The purpose of this problem is for you to demonstrate that you can use the above algorithm to generate two correlated random variates.  Let U be a random variate with a gamma distribution having a shape parameter of 4 and a scale parameter of 10.  Let V have a gamma distribution with shape parameter of 4 and with the expected value of V being 20.  Finally, let the correlation coefficient between U and V by 0.8. a.  Using Excel, generate the necessary number of random numbers needed to produce the two correlated random variates U and V.  Round those numbers to three digits to the right of the decimal and list those random numbers here. [rn] b.  Using those rounded values for your random numbers, generate U and V, and list your two random variates here. [rv] Note that I will use your rounded values to generate U and V myself to verify your work so make sure you use the rounded values and not the  full random numbers generated by Excel with all their digits.  You might want to show your work in the final problem to receive any partial credit for your work in case your numerical values are wrong.

(10 pts)   Choice A: With which continental landmass was the Florida basement terrain associated during the Paleozoic?  Briefly discuss at least 3 different lines of evidence (different kinds of data) that have been used to infer the post Rodinia, pre-Pangean origin for Florida's Paleozoic basement rocks, commenting specifically on how/why those data help establish Florida's late Precambrian/Paleozoic origins . Choice B: Discuss the rocks and/or geologic structures commonly associated with continental rifting environments and detail 3 different observations/characteristics/features of the geology of Florida basement rocks  (i.e. rock units/types and ages, geologic structures, etc.) that preserve evidence of the rifting of Pangea. Choice C: Discuss the geologic timing of the deposition of Florida's Carbonate Platform during the Mesozoic and the main conditions that led to and affected its formation.  Be sure to include in your discussion the MCSB and differences in carbonate deposition before and after that boundary, and the conditions that led to its formation. Choice D: Discuss the role of sea level change in affecting the Cenozoic sedimentation history of northern peninsular Florida during the Eocene through Pleistocene Epochs.  Associate the changes you discuss with specific times, geologic units and changes in the character of rocks and/or sediments.

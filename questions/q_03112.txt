Use the following information to answer the question.An elementary school science teacher decided to liven up the classroom with a saltwater aquarium. Knowing that saltwater aquaria can be quite a hassle, the teacher proceeded stepwise. First, the teacher conditioned the water. Next, the teacher decided to stock the tank with various marine invertebrates, including a polychaete, a siliceous sponge, several bivalves, a shrimp, several sea anemones of different types, a colonial hydra, a few coral species, an ectoproct, a sea star, and several herbivorous gastropod varieties. Lastly, she added some vertebrates--a parrot fish and a clown fish. She arranged for daily feedings of copepods and feeder fish.Normally, the clown fish readily swims among the tentacles of the sea anemones; the parrot fish avoids them. One hypothesis for the clown fish's apparent immunity is that they slowly build a tolerance to the sea anemone's toxin. A second hypothesis is that a chemical in the mucus that coats the clown fish prevents the nematocysts from being triggered. Which of the following graphs supports the second, but not the first, of these hypotheses?

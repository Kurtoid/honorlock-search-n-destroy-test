This problem concerns the AVL trees.  The classic binary search tree has the property that for any node X, all nodes in the left subtree have keys that are strictly smaller, and all nodes in the right subtree have keys that are greater or equal to, the key of node X. AVL trees actually have a weaker key constraint, which is that for any node X, all nodes in the left subtree have keys that are smaller or equal, and all nodes in the right subtree have keys that are greater or equal to, the key of node X.  Give an example scenario of inserting a sequence of (non-unique) keys into an initially empty AVL tree that produces a tree that has a node X whose left subtree contains a key that is equal to (rather than being strictly less than) the key of node X. (2 points)  An AVL tree is a balanced tree but it does not mean that all its branches from the root to the leafs are equal length. Draw and upload an AVL tree in which one branch is two edges longer than another.  (3 points)

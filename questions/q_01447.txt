You are an AT in the high school setting. One of the starting senior football players who is 17 years old has been experiencing a difficult time at home for the past 6 months and now his parents are getting a divorce. You notice at practice that he remains to himself and really doesn't appear to be a part of the team. This is definitely not how he normally behaves since he was one of the vocal leaders during last year's playoff team. When you attempt to speak to him he said, "Just go on because I don't feel like talking about anything, besides you shouldn't worry about me because my parents sure don't right now." You learn from other teammates that he is living with his older brother and that his brother likes to drink a lot. They say that Brian has been drinking as well, and that is something that he has never done before. You decide to talk to the athlete again and mention his drinking and he says, "Why is it such a big deal? I see my brother do it all of the time. It helps me get through everything that's going on right now." Answer the following questions. (2 points each; 10 points total)  What is your next step with this athlete?

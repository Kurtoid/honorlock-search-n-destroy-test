Question 26-30 (Included in each question) Boeing plans to negotiate with Delta airlines to sell the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. As part of the selling strategy Boeing plans to give delta the option to buy the aircraft for fixed price in three years for $200 million. The current market price of the aircraft is $190 million. You have been hired by Boeing to value this option. Based on daily data, you estimate Boeing stock has a volatility of 3%/day and Airbus has a volatility of 4%/day. Boeing has 50% in defense and 50% in commercial aircraft, while Airbus is 100% in commercial aircraft business. The 3-year Treasury rate is 3% and the 20-year rate is 4% per year. What type of option is Boeing giving Delta?

Suppose the market supply for good X is given by QSx = 8Px - 100 and the market demand for good X is given by QDx = 140 - 4Px, where Px is the price of good X, QSx is the quantity supplied of good X, and QDx is the quantity demanded of good X. Find the equilibrium price, equilibrium quantity, consumer surplus, and producer surplus.

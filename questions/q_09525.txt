A county announced it was accepting bids for the construction of a new courthouse. A contractor, who was interested in submitting a bid for the project, but planned on using a subcontractor for the electrical work on the project, advertised for bids from area electricians. Four electricians submitted bids to the contractor in the following amounts:$65,000, $80,000, $95,000, and $100,000. After compiling all of the bids from the electricians and calculating her costs based on the lowest bids, the contractor submitted her general bid to the county. The county accepted this bid. After the acceptance, the electrician who had submitted the lowest bid realized he had made a mistake in his calculations. His bid should have been $100,000. The electrician immediately notified the contractor of his mistake and stated that he was revoking his bid. The contractor informed the electrician that it was impossible for him to change his bid, and the contractor, having used the bid in making her own bid, was accepting the electrician's $65,000 bid.

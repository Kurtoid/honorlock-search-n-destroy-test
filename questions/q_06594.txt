According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. natural gas proved reserves have increased from 70 trillion cubic feet in 2000 to 504.5 trillion cubic feet in December 2019 (the most recent data available). In large part, this increase occurred because of large technological changes in the extraction of natural gas such as hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," [the use of a pressurized liquid to fracture the rock in which natural gas is trapped to extract the natural gas] and horizontal drilling. You work for your local utility company, which has named you the chair of the committee charged with recommending what sort of new power generating plant to build. Using the supply/demand framework, explain what you expect will be the effect in the natural gas market of these new technologies. You do NOT need to draw any diagrams; just explain your answer describing what happens to the supply and demand curves.

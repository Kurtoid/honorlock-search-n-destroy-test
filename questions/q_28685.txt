Bonus:  Work out the following cross.  REMEMBER -- you must show ALL your LABELED STEPS, as instructed in class.    In hedgehogs, pretend that big (B) is dominant to small (b) at a paw-size gene, and that stiff quills (Q) are dominant to soft quills (q) at a quill stiffness gene.  A cross between a big-pawed soft-quilled hedgehog and a big-pawed stiff-quilled hedgehog resulted in at least one offspring with small paws and soft quills.  Figure out the parents' genotypes and work out this cross (show and label all steps) to get the expected genotype and phenotype ratios for the F1 generation.

Plant roots support complex microbial communities that can influence plant growth, nutrition, and health, yet relatively little known about the impact of abiotic stresses on the root microbiota.  Four cultivated rice varieties in three distinct soils were grown under controlled greenhouse conditions. The distinct soils were collected from rice fields at three separate locations across the California Central Valley. Drought was imposed on 1-month-old plants by ceasing irrigation and letting the soils progressively dry down until half of the plants exhibited leaf rolling, a common symptom of drought stress, after which sufficient water was added periodically to keep the plants alive but still under stress. To characterize root microbiomes, communities assembled in the rhizosphere (on-the-root) and endosphere (within -root), as well as in unplanted bulk soils were sequenced. The results of PCA analyses for the following variables are shown above.   Summarize the results for the following:  Endosphere compared to rhizosphere and bulk:  [ans1]  PC2 identifies: [ans2]  PC3 identifies: [ans3] Overall Summary:  [ans4]

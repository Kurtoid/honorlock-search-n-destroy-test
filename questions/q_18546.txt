Part 2. The following 8 short essay questions are designed to evaluate critical thinking/reasoning skills, please make sure that you provide the most detailed answer you can.  You do not need to answer all of the questions.  What you need to do is choose 2 the following questions to answer (correctly number which questions you chose). (5 pts. each)   1) The Nebular Hypothesis explains how Earth formed through various phases of accretion and differentiation.  Explain in your own words why differentiation of Earth is the most significant event in Earth's history.  2) The Earth system includes the Biosphere, Lithosphere, Atmosphere, and Hydrosphere.  Pick two of those spheres and briefly discuss how a change in one will result in change in the other.  Focus your answer on how the spheres interact with one another (Hint: think about the concept of plate tectonics).  3) In your own words, explain why the theory of plate tectonics is considered the grand unifying theory in geology.  Keep in mind geologic features such as rift valleys, mountain ranges, faults, fossils, and other related phenomena.  4) What is the definition of a mineral and why is that definition so important to the methods used to identify minerals and how humans utilize minerals?  5) Explain the rock cycle (in detail) and explain in your own words how each rock type can form and whether or not the rock cycle has to have a single starting point.  6) We now know that seismic waves have provided knowledge about multiple processes/aspects of Earth.  What are at least three of the major areas of Geology that seismic studies have helped advance and how did these studies advance those fields of study?  7) What is the difference between passive and active continental margins in regards to the continental shelf, slope, and rise?  Why does the difference exist?  8) How has ocean floor mapping/investigations changed since the late 1800s? What have these new methodologies allowed for in regards to economic potential?

232Th decays by a series of alpha and beta decays to give stable 208Pb.  232Th has a very long half life  t1/2 = 14 billion years. Other than the stable Pb, the other products in the decay series are relatively short-lived. Suppose that a sample of rock contains 232Th and 208Pb, where all of the Pb is due to decay of the Th.  If Th and Pb are present in a molar ratio Th/Pb = [ratio], what is the age of the rock? Give your answer in billions of years. (1 billion = 109)  ln(2) = 0.6931

An insurance company sets up a statistical test with a null hypothesis that the average time for processing a claim is 7 days, and an alternative hypothesis that the average time for processing a claim is greater than 7 days. After completing the statistical test, it is concluded that the average time exceeds 7 days. It is eventually learned that the mean process time is actually 8 days. What type of error occurred in the statistical test?

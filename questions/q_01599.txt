Problem 2 An F-shaped metal body welded to a collar is supported as shown.  There is a 480 N vertical force applied at point B.  Neglecting the weight of the body, what are the tensions in the cables EB and CD and the components of reactions acting on the body at point A?      For all forces, give scalar values with units.  For any component of reaction that does not exist at a given support, enter NA. Ax = [Ax] Ay = [Ay] Az = [Az] MAx = [MAx] MAy = [MAy] MAz = [MAz] TCD = [T_CD] TBE = [T_BE]

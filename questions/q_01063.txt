(4/6) JT was found in his dorm unresponsive with a bottle of Vicodin on the floor.  He was taken to an emergency room, stabilized and admitted to the medical floor for 24-hour observation.  When questioned, he denied suicidal thoughts and continually requested discharge stating: "Everything is fine. I need to go to school in the morning. I have a test." Concerned for his safety, the RN requests a consultation with the Psychiatric Emergency Team (P.E.T.) clinician.  The P.E.T. RN assesses JT and determines that he is in imminent danger of harming himself.  Collateral data shows a recent break-up with his girlfriend and failing grades in school. His appetite is poor and he finds it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. His relationship with his parents is "strained" at best, as they require "perfect behavior and excellent grades." The P.E.T. Team RN places him on a 5150 with a plan to transfer to an inpatient behavioral health facility in the morning. JT maintains that he was not suicidal and does not want to be held against his will. He feels it is against his constitutional rights to be locked up. Does he have any recourse during this period of observation and assessment?

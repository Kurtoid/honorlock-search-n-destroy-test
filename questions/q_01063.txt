Adak Island, Alaska, is one of the Aleutian Islands in the Bering Sea where the sea otter population collapsed.   As a function of [feature], Adak Island receives minimal annual energy input from the sun. The average summer temperature on Adak Island is 13oC;  the average winter temperature on Adak Island is -2oC.  This annual variation is due to [feature2]. The typical difference between the maximum and minimum annual temperatures on Adak Island is 23oC.  (This compares with a value of 49oC in St. Louis, Missouri, and 31oC in Orlando, Florida.)  This relatively small difference between maximum and minimum temperatures is likely due to [feature3].

Problem #4 (25 points):  A GaAs/InGaAs/GaAs PIN photodiode has a circular diode of diameter 100um, an I region thickness of 0.8um, and NA=ND= 1x1017cm-3.  Assume that a of the InGaAs layer is 3x104cm-1 at the wavelength of interest (0.6um), that the surface has been AR coated, and that the absorption only occurs in the I region. A) Calculate the responsivity of the photodiode. B) If the diode shunt resistance is 30kO, has a load of 20kO, and is biased at 0V: calculate the NEP at T=300degC (don't forget your units). C) For the situation in B), and if the diode has a capacitance of 2pF, find the RC time constant limited bandwidth.

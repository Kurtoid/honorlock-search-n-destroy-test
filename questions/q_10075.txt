4   Read the passage below. Use the information in the passage and your own knowledge to answer the questions that follow.   COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder  1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) is the term used to describe several lung diseases including bronchitis and emphysema.  2. People with COPD have trouble breathing because they have damaged their lungs, usually because of smoking.  3. Eighty percent of people who develop COPD are or have been, smokers. 4. However, breathing in dust or fumes may also cause COPD.  5. There is also a small genetic risk linked to COPD called alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.  6. Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a molecule that protects your lungs from being digested by a protease enzyme released by white blood cells in the lungs.  7. People who have an alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency usually develop COPD at a younger age. 8. There are about 65 million people in the UK and 835000 are known to have COPD. 9. There are thought to be another 2 million who have COPD but have not been diagnosed because they have not asked for medical help.  10. They seem content to put up with what they call smoker's cough. Sadly, there are about 25000 deaths a year in the UK because of COPD. 11. The symptoms of COPD do not usually show until after the age of 35.  12. They include breathlessness when exercising, persistent coughing of mucus and frequent chest infections, particularly in winter.  13. The walls of the airways get thicker in response to inflammation, more mucus is made and the air sacs are damaged. 14. Although any damage that has already happened to the lungs cannot be reversed, it is possible to prevent COPD from getting worse by making lifestyle changes. 15. Chest infections are common and can be caused by bacteria or viruses. 16. People with COPD are advised to have two vaccinations. 17. A yearly 'flu jab' each autumn protects against possible influenza and any chest infection that may develop due to this.  18. Vaccination against Pneumococcus, a bacterium that can cause serious chest infections, involves a one-off injection. 19. Treatment for COPD usually involves relieving the symptoms, such as using an inhaler to make breathing easier.  20. Other treatments such as steroids, antibiotics, breathing oxygen from a cylinder, and inhaling mucolytic (mucus-thinning) medicines are sometimes prescribed in more severe cases, or during a worsening of symptoms.

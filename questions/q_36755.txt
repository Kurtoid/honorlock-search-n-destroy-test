They concluded that bioremediation procedures were the best option for cleaning up the site. Certain types of bacteria are able to feed on and digest toxic organic substances, such as pesticides, and use them as fuel for cell respiration.

Once the contaminants are degraded, these microorganism populations will die off because they will have used up all of their food supply.The bacteria used in this bioremediation procedure are

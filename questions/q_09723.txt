Specifically, the C gene is inactive above 35degC, and it is maximally active from 15degC to 25degC. This temperature regulation of gene expression produces rabbits with a distinctive coat coloring. In the warm, central parts of the rabbit's body, the gene is inactive, and no pigments are produced, causing the fur color to be white.

11) Dr. Shed is interested in the relationship between air temperature and feelings of aggression in humans.  She randomly recruits 100 participants and randomly assigns them to one of two groups.     Group #1: Members of Group #1 are put in a room where the temperature is 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius) for 30 minutes.  Group #2: Members of Group #2 are put in a room for 30 minutes that is identical in every way to the Group #1 room except the temperature for the Group #2 room is 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).

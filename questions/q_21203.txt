What volume (mL) of a concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide (6.00 M) must be diluted to  to make a  solution of sodium hydroxide?
The context of this question are the instructions and details provided above in the "Hands-on-Testing" text.  Based on the the generated model, create a new model that covers all actions listed above and uses the necessary asserts to test according to the general task and that it follows the rules. For actions etc. that are missing from the model, add them manually to the new model so that it represents all possible behaviors of the SUT. Note: Make sure that we can generate very long test cases from the model. Also add the action Double the quantity to the model. This action only works if there is one and only one file in the folder! Thus, if there is one very cheap product in the basket, we will have two very cheap products in the basket after executing the action Double the quantity.  Use yed live (see link below) to draw the model. Download the graphml file and upload it as the answer to this question.  https://www.yworks.com/yed-live/

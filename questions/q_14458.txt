One toy will be selected at random from a large bin that contains 50 bear beanie babies, 75 space jam bugs bunnies, 110 hot wheels thunderbirds, 50 dalmatian beanie babies, 80 tamagachis, and 25 my little ponies.  No toys are added to the bin over the course of a business day. Jonas takes 6 kids (his own and his brother's kids) to lunch and each child gets their own happy meal on Wednesday, and they are the first people to order (so the bin is full of toys).

The Crown Bottling Company has just installed a new bottling process that will fill 16-ounce bottles of the popular Crown Classic Cola soft drink. Both overfilling and underfilling bottles are undesirable: Underfilling leads to customer complaints and overfilling costs the company considerable money. In order to verify that the filler is set up correctly, the company wishes to see whether the mean bottle fill, m, is close to the target fill of 16 ounces. To this end, a random sample is selected from the output of a test filler run. If the sample results cast a substantial amount of doubt on the hypothesis that the mean bottle fill is the desired 16 ounces, then the filler's initial setup will be readjusted. This is the output by Minitab.  Please interpret the result of the hypothesis testing.

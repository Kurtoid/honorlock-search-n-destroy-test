BMED 2110 - Final Exam (quiz 10) Recent research concerned with fuels used for jets and airplanes has shown that the addition of natural products leads to an increase in the stored energy associated with these fuels. A candidate for this application has been isolated form pine wood. It is a molecule with the structure C10H16 . In order to determine the enthalpy of formation of this unknown molecule it is injected with a rate of 1.36 g/min into a reactor. A second inlet stream is air, which enters the reactor at a flow rate of    32.8 l/min and a temperature of 127 C.  The molecule reacts with the oxygen in the air to form CO2 and H2O, the degree of conversion of the molecule is 100% and the reactor loses  133W  as heat to the environment. The temperature of the product stream is 1.75*103 K. Calculate the specific molar enthalpy of formation of the unknown molecule for its reference state at standard pressure and Temperature.    You might need the following data for your analysis: Properties of the unknown substance: chemical structure: C10H16 density: 0.858 g/ml  melting point: -63C  boiling point: 156.85 C   Enthalpies of formation: Water(liq): -285.83 kJ/mol Water (gas): -241.82 kJ/mol CO2 (gas): -393.51 kJ/mol   Hints: For your calculation you must correctly fill out the NH-table, which is provided below (a copy of this table was sent out prior to the quiz, if you do not have it at hand you may draw your own table). A degree of freedom analysis is not required, however you might use it to your advantage.

Your first day of a new clinical experience you evaluate a patient with foot and ankle pain.  You take an hour asking all kinds of questions and run through all of the special tests and assessment techniques we have covered in class.  Upon completing the evaluation, you excuse yourself and consult with your CI but are struggling to process everything you have found.  Your CI who has 10 years of clinical experience asks you to join her with the patient, asks a few key questions, performs 4 quick tests and measures and within 5 minutes tells you the patient has plantar fasciitis and I need you to show them these 3 exercises.  You demonstrated _________  while your CI demonstrated________

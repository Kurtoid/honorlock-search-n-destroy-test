Monetta, Inc, has no debt, but is considering borrowing for the first time to finance a three-year project. The company currently has an unlevered cost of capital of 13 percent and a 30 percent tax rate. The project requires an initial investment of $1.2 million, which will be straight-line depreciated over the three-year project life. The project, which is as risky as the firm's current projects, is expected to generate earnings before depreciation of $600,000 per year for the three years. The capital for the initial investment will be raised with a loan for the full amount. The loan's interest rate is 8 percent (which is also the current risk-free rate) and the principal will be repaid in one balloon payment at the end of the third year. What is the APV of the project?
Based on the experiment that researchers did on Anolisdewlap color, in comparison to a species that lives in a forested habitat, a species that lives in a bright, open habitat would be expected to have:

A technician is asked to streak plates with E. coli using the quadrant method. To start, the technician dips the sterile loop into the inoculant stock and performs the first streak in quadrant 1 of the labeled agar plate. Organize the following steps from 1 to 4 to continue the process into quadrant 2:
You have two flasks (labeled A and B) that each contain an equal population of normal animal cells. You place flask A in a machine called a shaking incubator, which shakes the flask at 37degC and keeps the cells moving so as to prevent them from adhering to the bottom of the flask. Flask B is allowed to sit in an incubator (without shaking) at 37degC. If you let the cells in each flask grow for a week, which result are you most likely to observe?

Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr A sample of gas collected at 21.0degC and 0.868 atm, has a volume of 1.83 liters.  What volume will the gas occupy if the temperature is increased to 38.0degC and the pressure is reduced to 0.658 atm?  To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem. Show your work (equation/and units) by using the equation editor () in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use    to insert ratios. Be sure to include proper units and the final answer! Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

11. In 2004, a random sample of 46 coyotes in a region of northern Minnesota showed the average age to be 2.05 years with a standard deviation of 0.82 years.  However, it is thought that the overall population mean age of coyotes is 1.75 years.  Test the hypothesis that coyotes in this region of northern Minnesota live longer than the average of 1.75 years.  (While answering the following sub-parts of this question, you will be including the null and alternative hypothesis, the test statistic, the p-value (a visualization and an interpretation), your statistical decision, and your conclusion in the context of the problem.) (c)  What is the p-value for Step 3 of the hypothesis test?

The method below implements the exponentiation operation recursively by taking advantage of the fact that, if the exponent n is even, then xn = (x n/2)2. Select the expression that should be used to complete the method so that it computes the result correctly. public static double power(double base, int exponent) {  if (exponent % 2 != 0) // if exponent is odd  {  return base * power(base, exponent - 1);   }  else if (exponent > 0)  {  double temp = ________________________ ;  return temp * temp;  }  return base; }

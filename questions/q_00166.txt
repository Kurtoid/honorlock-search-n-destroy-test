Make a labeled sketch of a parallel-plate capacitor with a plate area of 0.04 m2, a plate separation of 0.001 m, a charge of -15nC on one plate, and a charge of +15 nC on the other plate. Your dimensions do not need to be accurate--they only need to be labeled accurately. [2] In your sketch for part A, in what direction is the electric field in the center of your parallel plate capacitor? [1] Find the capacitance of your parallel-plate capacitor. [3] Find the voltage difference across your parallel-plate capacitor. [3] Find the magnitude of the electric field at the center of your parallel-plate capacitor. [3]

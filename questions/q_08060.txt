Read carefully through the paragraph below, and decide which of options A-E is correct.  Phytochrome is a protein pigment that absorbs red and far-red light most strongly. Native phytochrome is a soluble protein, occurring as a dimer of two subunits, a light absorbing pigment molecule called the chromophore and a polypeptide chain called the apoprotein. Phytochrome is a light-regulated protein kinase, which first autophosphorylates and then activates other proteins. In high-light grown plants, phytochrome is present in a red light-absorbing form, Pr. This form is converted by red light to a far-red light-absorbing form, Pfr.

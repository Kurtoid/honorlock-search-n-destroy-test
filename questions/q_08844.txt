Section 5: Location Quotient. Table 1: Location quotients for the Austin-Round Rock, TX Metropolitan Statistical Areas from the BLS.          Table 2: Location quotients for the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX Metropolitan Statistical Areas from the BLS.          The questions in this section are about the BLS data for the Austin-Round Rock, TX (Austin MSA) and the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX (Houston MSA) Metropolitan Statistical Areas location quotients, presented in Tables 1 and 2. Use the employment location quotient to answer the questions (as you have done in Homework Assignment 4). This data has not been sorted by the Location Quotient as in your Homework Assignment 4. Choose one option to indicate the best answer.   1. [2 points] Determine the specialization of the Austin and Houston MSAs relative to the U.S. in Administrative and waste services and Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction:     Both the Austin and Houston MSA specialize in Administrative and waste services and Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction. The Austin MSA specializes in Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction, and the Houston MSA - in Administrative and waste services. The Houston MSA specializes in Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction, and the Austin MSA - in Administrative and waste services. The Austin MSA specializes in both sectors, but not the Houston MSA. The Houston MSA specializes in both sectors, but not the Austin MSA.    2. [2 points] The industry in Table 2 for which the Houston MSA has the proportion of the employment that is the most similar to the share of employment for the US is  Other services, except public administration. Accommodation and food services. Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting. Construction. None of the above.    3. [2 points] The industry in Table 1 for which the Austin MSA has the proportion of the employment that differs the most from the share of employment for the US is   Other services, except public administration. Administrative and waste services Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting. Real estate and rental and leasing. None of the above.    4. [2 points] If a real estate company expects to enjoy significant benefits from agglomeration economies, which MSA, out of these two, should the firm choose based on the employment location quotient alone?  The Austin MSA. The Houston MSA. Both MSAs will bring significant agglomeration economies. None of MSAs will bring significant agglomeration economies.

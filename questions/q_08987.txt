When the paramedic-patient relationship is terminated by the paramedic without assurance to that of an equal/greater level of care is considered:
A newly licensed nurse is reporting to the charge nurse about the care provided to a client. The nurse states, "The client said his pain returned, so I checked his medical record, and he last received his pain medication 6 hours ago. The order reads every 4 hours PRN for pain, so I decided he needs it. I asked the unit nurse to observe me preparing and administering it. I checked with the client 40 minutes later, and he said his pain is going away." The charge nurse should inform the newly licensed nurse that she left out which step of the nursing process?

For your final examination, you should write a cohesive, well-developed essay that fully addresses the essay prompt. Please closely read the following CQ Researcher articles (published March 7, 2014 (volume 24, issue 10)) and then the prompt below.     "Home Schooling-Should States Let Home-Schoolers Play on Public School Teams: Pro"by Isaac Sommers, Policy Analyst for the Texas Home School Coalition   "Home Schooling-Should States Let Home-Schoolers Play on Public School Teams: Con"by William Bosher, Professor of Public Policy at Virginia Commonwealth University     par. 1Twenty-eight states already permit home-schooled students to participate in athletic teams and other competitive extracurricular activities, such as debate, governed by state school associations like Texas' University Interscholastic League (UIL). They do so for good reason: By home-schooling, parents save states billions of dollars. Home-schooling in Texas saves almost $3.5 billion annually, and the parents of home-schoolers pay property taxes that fund public schools. Unfortunately, current policy in Texas and some other states bars home-schooled families from participating in extracurricular activities that their taxes help to fund. par. 2In Texas, this legislative oversight has its roots in discriminatory policy. In 1913, Texas law established UIL activities for all Texas students. Two years later, however, eligibility was restricted to white, public school students. (Ironically, the majority of Texas students were home schooled at the time.) Finally, in 1967, the right of minority groups to participate was recognized and restored, but home-schooled students continue to be deprived of this simple yet important opportunity. par. 3To counter this discrimination, several Texas legislators, as well as home-school advocacy groups like the Texas Home School Coalition, have worked tirelessly to promote legislation fondly referred to as the Tim Tebow bill, named for the home-schooled Heisman Trophy winner who played football thanks to Florida's equal-participation law. The bill would allow home-school students who live in and pay for a given public school district, and who meet the eligibility specifications required of public school students, to try out for that school's UIL activities. Simple provisions in the bill would prevent failing public school students from attempting to game the system by claiming they are "home schooled." par. 4Determinations that students meet grade-average requirements are easily made by requiring written verification of passing grades from parents, who are home-schooled students' legally recognized teachers. Considering that home school students who participated in a number of large studies have scored an average of 30 points higher on national standardized achievement tests than their public school peers, we can easily create a trustworthy system that provides equal opportunity to each student. This allows students to excel both academically and athletically, regardless of the method of their education. par. 5The Tim Tebow bill would ultimately benefit families -- especially those in rural areas -- by restoring equality to the UIL system.   par. 1For public school administrators who have historically supported school choice and competition, so-called Tebow bills allowing home-schooled students to participate in public school extracurricular activities offer a conundrum. It would seem that true advocates of choice should oppose any limitation to it; however, equality must be balanced with equity. What may seem like an effort to treat all students the same could actually treat some students unfairly. Students who must comply with attendance requirements, maintain grade-point averages and meet behavior expectations would compete for team slots with students who cannot be held to the same rules. Unfairness could also result if public school teams began recruiting home-schooled athletes. par. 2Many home-schooling parents approach the issue as taxpayers. It is certainly true that home-schoolers as well as the 70 percent of homes with no school-age children heavily support the school system. However, it is also true that most citizens opt out of particular public services without being entitled to any benefit or compensation for taxes paid. If I choose never to use a public library, the purchases for my Nook are not paid by the public sector. If I never use a public recreation facility, my private gym fees will not be subsidized. par. 3When I served as a local school superintendent and as state superintendent for Virginia, prorated funding was awarded to public schools when home-schooled and private school students participated in their programs. The focus of that policy was on academics, however, which have been and should remain the focus of school-choice movements. Nonpublic school students were guaranteed access to classes, but if they wanted to participate in extra activities such as athletics, they needed to enroll. Tim Tebow is admirable for his faith, athletic ability and role-model status, but what if the next "Tebow" movement presses for allowing home-schooled students to stand for election as student government president or homecoming queen? par. 4Tebow bills proposed in many states have become a marketing tool for home-schoolers to advance an emotional rather than a rational appeal for fairness. But why were home-schooling policies first created? To solidify the right of each family to teach its children at home in its own way. That being the case, the push for Tebow laws violates home-schoolers' core mission, since at the same time as home-schooling families are seeking even greater separation from state requirements for academic testing, they are requesting much closer integration with public schools through athletics.     _____________________________________________________________________________________ Topic: Using the above-noted articles, "Home Schooling-Should States Let Home-Schoolers Play on Public School Teams: Pro" and "Home Schooling-Should States Let Home-Schoolers Play on Public School Teams: Con," as reference sources, write an essay in which you analyze each author's use of one rhetorical tool or rhetorical appeal to achieve his or her specific purpose.  To start, determine what you believe is each author's specific purpose. Choose one of the following specific purposes for each author: to accuse, to calm, to condemn, to celebrate, to correct, to counter, to defend, to dismiss, to incite, to justify, to overturn, to praise, to provoke, to rally, to silence, or to solve.   Then, determine which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Pro" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose and then which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Con" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose. You must choose both rhetorical tools and/or appeals from the following list:       allusions authorities/outside sources definitions description dialogue examples facts figurative language narration personal testimony/anecdotes scenarios statistics counterarguments concessions qualifiers organization voice appeal to logic appeal to emotion appeal to character appeal to need appeal to value       Organize your ideas into a four-paragraph essay that includes the following paragraphs: (paragraph 1) an introduction paragraph; (paragraphs 2 and 3) two separate, well-developed rhetorical tools and/or rhetorical appeals body paragraphs (one focused on the "Pro" author's use of your chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose and the other focused on the "Con" author's use of your other chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose); and (paragraph 4) a conclusion paragraph. Your essay must include a forecasting thesis statement and effective topic and concluding sentences in each body paragraph.

In 1944, a well-intentioned individual introduced 29 reindeer to St. Matthew Island off the coast of Alaska. David Klein, an ecologist, visited the island in 1957 and found 1,350 well-fed reindeer munching on lichens.  In 1963, Klein returned to the island and counted 6,000 reindeer.  The population had soared far above the island's carrying capacity.  Lichens had become sparser and the average body size of the reindeer had decreased. In 1963--1964, the island went through an unusually harsh winter with extremely low temperatures and excessive amounts of snow. When Klein returned again in 1966, bleached-out reindeer bones littered the island and only 42 reindeer were alive.  Only one was a male; it had abnormal antlers, which made it unlikely to reproduce.  There were no fawns (baby deer).  By 1980, there were no reindeer on St. Matthew Island.

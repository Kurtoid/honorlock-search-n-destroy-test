The social contract's terms, when they are well understood, can be reduced to a single stipulation:the individual member alienates [gives] himself totally to the whole community together with all hisrights....Once this multitude is united this way into a body, an offense against one of its members is an offense against the body politic. It would be even less possible to injure the body without its members feeling it. Duty and interest thus equally require the two contracting parties to aid each other mutually. The individual people should be motivated from their double roles as individuals and members of the body, to combine all the advantages which mutual aid offers them.... So that the social pact will not become meaningless words, it tacitly includes this commitment, which alone gives power to the others: Whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be forced to obey it by the whole body politic...-- Jean Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract, 1762  What type of government does Rousseaudescribe in his social contract?

You are now a prisoner faced with a dilemma.  You must choose to either keep the 4 points for this question for yourself or donate 0.53 points to the class pool.  The total amount of points you will receive is the sum of the pool points plus the amount you have kept for yourself.  For example, assume your classmates (16 total) donate 3.18 points to the pool ( 6 of the 15 other people donate).  If you choose to donate your 0.53 points to the pool also, you will get 3.71 points; however, if you keep your 4 points then you will receive 7.18  points.  The maximum you can receive is 12.0 points and the minimum is 0.53 points.  Like all questions on this exam, this question accounts for 4 of the total 100 possible exam points.  Please make your choice.
Festge Park is located 20 minutes away from Minneapolis, MN and 40 minutes away from St. Paul, MN.  Suppose that these twin cities have 1,000,000 inhabitants each, and residents in both cities have the same income and preferences for regional parks. Assume that the cost for an individual to go to a regional park is represented by the cost of the time it takes him or her to get to the park. Also assume that the cost of time for individuals in Minneapolis and St. Paul is $0.25 per minute. You observe that each inhabitant of Minneapolis goes to Festge Park two times a year while each inhabitant of St. Paul goes to the park only once a year. Assume the following: the only people who go to the park are the residents of Minneapolis and St. Paul; the parks annual operating costs are $3,000,000 a year; and the prevailing discount rate is 10% for public expenditures. Finally, assume that the park will never be sold or cease to operate (it will 'last' forever). Assuming that the total annual expenditures of inhabitants  from each city correspond to two points of the same linear individual demand curve for visits to Festge Park, derive that demand curve. What is the sum total of all inhabitants' consumer surplus associated with utilizing this park?

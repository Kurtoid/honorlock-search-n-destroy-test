For the following question(s), use this passage and the accompanying glossary. Development of Aggression Beginning in late infancy, all children display aggression at times. As interactions with siblings and peers increase, so do aggressive outbursts. By the early preschool years, two general types of aggression emerge. The most common is instrumental aggression, in which children want an object, privilege, or space and, in trying to get it, push, shout at, or otherwise attack a person who is in the way. The other type, hostile aggression, is meant to hurt another person. Hostile aggression comes in at least three varieties. Physical aggression harms others through physical injurypushing, hitting, kicking, or punching others or destroying another's property. Verbal aggression harms others through threats of physical aggression, name-calling, or hostile teasing. Relational aggression damages another's peer relationships through social exclusion, malicious gossip, or friendship manipulation.

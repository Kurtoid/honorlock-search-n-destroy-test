Use the following chemical equation to answer the questions below: H2SO4(aq) + Ba(OH)2(aq) --> 2H2O(l) + BaSO4(s) In a beaker, 15.0 mL of 1.0M H2SO4 is combined with 25.0 mL of 0.80 M Ba(OH)2. Molar mass of BaSO4 is 233.38 g/mol.  Determine the limiting reactant in this scenario. How many grams of BaSO4 will be produced? How many moles of excess reactant will remain unreacted in solution at the end?  *Show all work to receive credit.*

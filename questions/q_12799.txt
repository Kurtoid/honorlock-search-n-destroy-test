On November 6, the proprietor of an independent bookstore sent a letter to a furniture wholesaler asking for the price of a certain bookshelf he knew the wholesaler sold. The wholesaler sent a written reply with a catalog listing the prices and descriptions of all of its available bookshelves. The letter stated that the terms of sale were cash within 10 days of delivery. On November 14, by return letter, the bookstore proprietor ordered the bookshelf, enclosing a check for $400, the listed price. Immediately on receipt of the order and check, the wholesaler informed the bookstore proprietor that there had been a pricing mistake in the catalog, which should have quoted the price as $450 for that bookshelf. The bookstore proprietor refused to pay the additional $50, arguing that his order of November 14 in which the $400 check was enclosed was a proper acceptance of the wholesaler's offer. In a suit for damages, will the wholesaler prevail?

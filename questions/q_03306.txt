You are working in long-term psychiatric facility on an all-male unit. You lead a group called "Cards and Coffee" on the unit every Monday. During this group, the men play cards and coffee is offered. The men decide as a group which card game will be played.  AB was recently transferred to the unit for good behavior from a more restrictive unit. You have had a busy morning and are 10 minutes late to start the session. Most of the men are familiar with the structure of the group and begin the session before you arrive. When you enter the room, AB is requesting to play Spades. Another member responds, "We don't play that game here. We only play Rummy. That's just how it is." AB appears to accept this and engages in the activity. However, after the first hand, AB begins escalating, cursing at staff and patients, and becomes paranoid that everyone is "trying to trick him." AB left the group and now refuses to attend all groups and may be transferred back to the more restrictive unit. Reflect on this situation and answer the following questions: a. Consider the group dynamics. Identify and explain one way the dynamics of the group could have contributed to AB's escalating behavior and avoidance of future groups. (3 points) b. Consider the structure and process of the group.  Identify and explain one way the structure and/or process of the group could have contributed to AB's escalating behavior and avoidance of future groups.  (3 points) c. Consider your role as an occupational therapist.  What could you have done differently that may have prevented AB's escalating behavior and avoidance of future groups?  (3 points)

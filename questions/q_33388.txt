Trio has 100 shares of voting common stock outstanding, all owned by Anne (basis $700).  Trio owns assets worth $1,200 with an adjusted basis of $900.  Trio owes $200 and has E&P of $300.  Plural is a publicly held corporation whose stock is traded on the NYSE.  Single is a wholly owned subsidiary of Plural.  Plural's basis in the Single stock is $100 (except when facts say Single is newly incorporated).  Assume that each Trio share is worth $10.  Unless indicated otherwise (1) each transaction has proper business purpose, (2) there is continuity of Trio's business enterprise, and (3) the transaction is pursuant to a plan of reorganization. In the problems below what are the consequences to Anne, Trio, Single and Plural?  Trio transfers all of its assets to Plural solely for $1,000 FMV of Plural voting stock and Plural's assumption of Trio's liabilities after which time Trio liquidates Plural immediately transfers the Trio assets to Single (subject to Trio's liabilities) for additional Single stock. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement between Trio and Single, Trio transfers all its assets to Single (which assumes Trio's liabilities) and Single pays to Trio $1,000 FMV of Plural voting stock (which P had contributed to Single to be used for this purpose). Plural transfers its voting stock worth $1,000 to Single (newly formed with no other capital) solely for stock of S.  Immediately thereafter, Single (whose only asset is Plural stock) merges into Trio.  Under the plan and by operation of state law, the Single stock owned by Plural is exchanged for one share of Trio stock; the Trio stock held by Anne is exchanged for the Plural stock received by Trio on the merger of Single into Trio.  (As a result of these exchanges Plural owns 100% of Trio).

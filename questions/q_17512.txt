A solenoid of length 18 cm consists of closely spaced coils of wire wrapped tightly around a wooden core. The magnetic field strength is 2.0 mT inside the solenoid near its center when a certain current flows through the coils.

Assume a system with three concurrent processes X, Y, and Z and four semaphores a, b, c, and d. All semaphores are binary semaphores initialized to one. Process X needs to acquire the semaphores a, b, c; Process Y needs b, c, d; and Process Z needs c, d, a, before entering their respective critical sections. Processes invoke the P (i.e. wait) operation to acquire the semaphores. After completing the execution of its critical section, each process invokes the V (i.e., signal) operation on its three semaphores.  Which one of the following represents a deadlock-free order of invoking the P operations by the processes?

The circuit below is supposed to take an input frequency of 650 Hz and produce an output frequency of 59.0909 Hz.    A.) Determine three (3) wiring errors within the circuit.  (The circuit is not missing probes/LEDs - look for things that would prohibit the circuit from operating correctly based on theory).  Fully explain what each issue is, and how you diagnosed the problem. B.) Explain how each wiring issue must fixed in order to produce the desired output frequency stated above.

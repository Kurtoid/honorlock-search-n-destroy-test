Which one of the following serves to protect against static build-up, dust collection, and mechanical damage to the CR imaging plate?
As a part of your responsibilities at a research I institution after the doctoral program, you routinely review manuscripts for various journals, conferences, and so forth. One day you came across a manuscript in your review folder that compares the standardized path coefficients of the mediation model using data collected in the US and China. You further noticed that for the measurement model, it used CFA. And then, it switched to the OLS regression analysis to test for the moderation effects. Although the current statistical analysis is acceptable, you believe the moderating effects may be better assessed using an SEM-based multigroup analysis.  Please prepare a constructive comment by describing the assessment procedure of measurement invariance first. Using Steenkamp and Baumgartner (1998), identify all needed steps in carrying out the measurement invariance tests for the study including what to look for in each step according to the authors. (10 points) Please explain the procedure in details to evaluate the significance of the moderating effect on a path coefficient using a multigroup analysis including what to look for by the authors. (10 points) Illustrate potential moderated mediation or mediated moderation including the condition(s) required for one over the other. Please use a simple example in answering this question.

Class Polychaeta is the most diverse group in the phylum Annelida.  You learned about several of the animals in this group that have adaptations for their lifestyles.  Two polychaete worms are described below.  Choose one, and only one, to answer.  Write in the space below which one, #1 or #2, you are answering and then type your answer. Choice #1 You viewed videos of the predator polychaete, Nereis.  1a) You observed the fleshy limbs called parapodia on Nereis. Describe what function besides locomotion the parapodia serve this active polychaete. 1b) Describe an adaptation on the head of this predator polychaete. OR Choice #2  You learned about a polychaete worm, called a feather duster worm, that lives a sessile life in a tube that it constructs. 2a) What is its feeding strategy? 2b) Describe the structure that it uses to feed and explain how it is adaptive for its lifestyle and feeding strategy.

In lab, a dialysis tubing was filled with a solution containing 1% starch and 15% glucose. The tubing was immersed in a beaker containing water and Lugol's iodine solution (0.1% Lugol's iodine).  The purpose of adding iodine to the water in the beaker was to determine if:

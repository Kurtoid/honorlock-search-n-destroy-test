Consider the E2 elimination of bromocyclohexane. We learned that E2 eliminations are fastest when the leaving group is antiperiplanar to the hydrogen being removed. First, draw a chair conformation of bromocyclohexane that satisfies this condition. Second, draw the bonding molecular orbital for the beta C-H bond and the antibonding molecular orbital for the C-Br bond on top of your chair conformation. Third, use that diagram to explain why anti eliminations are faster.

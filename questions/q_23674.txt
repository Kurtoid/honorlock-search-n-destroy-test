QUESTION 4             A student measures the weight of a cannonball as 50 N.                       4.1   Name a piece of equipment he could use to measure the weight.   (1)                   4.2   State the equation relating weight, mass and g.   (1)                   4.3   Calculate the mass of the cannonball.   (2)                       A cannonball is fired from a cannon. When the cannonball is fired, the cannon moves in the opposite direction, as shown in the diagram.             Right click on the button to open the diagram of the cannon in a new window.                         4.4   Using ideas about momentum, explain why the cannon moves in the opposite direction to the cannonball.   (3)                   4.5   The cannonball leaves the canon with a velocity of 72 m/s. Calculate the velocity of the canon after the it has fired the cannonball.   mass of the canon = 1 200 kg   (3)

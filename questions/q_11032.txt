Ella es estudiante de la universidad tambien (also); estudia matematicas. El sabado por la manana estudiamos en la biblioteca por unas horas porque (because) tenemos un examen importante este viernes. Por la tarde merendamos un helado de chocolate en la Chocolateria Entrelagos. !Que rico! El sabado por la noche fuimos al Restaurante Chester's que esta muy cerca de la casa de Irene. Alli cenamos una pichanga --es un plato de papas fritas con jamon, huevos y queso, y tomamos unas cervezas. Me gusto mucho porque las papas fritas son una de mis comidas favoritas. Chester's es un buen lugar para estar con amigos y pasarlo bien.             El domingo por la manana me desperte muy temprano, a las seis. Mis padres y yo decidimos visitar a mis abuelos. Ellos viven en Temuco, una ciudad que esta a dos horas de Valdivia. Irene nos acompano --a mi abuela le encanta pasar tiempo con Irene; son buenas amigas. Mi abuela es muy buena cocinera y nos preparo un almuerzo fantastico. Comimos una sopa de verduras, pan, una ensalada mixta de tomate y zanahorias y un plato de pasta con camarones. A todos (They all) les encanto el almuerzo y todos comieron mucho.             El domingo volvimos a Valdivia muy tarde, a las diez de la noche. Pasamos por la casa de Irene primero porque ella vive un poco lejos de la casa de mis padres. Cuando por fin llegamos a casa, me acoste y me dormi inmediatamente. Fue un fin de semana largo, pero me gusto pasar tanto tiempo con mi novia y mi familia.     El fin de semana Rufino no comio...  jamon camarones verduras galletas

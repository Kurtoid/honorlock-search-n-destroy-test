The Isthmus of Panama cut off gene flow between Atlantic and Pacific populations of a species of fish. The cessation of gene flow led to the accumulation of genetic differences between the populations, which led to reproductive isolation. Now Atlantic and Pacific populations of this fish are separate species, and even if they were again to come into contact with each other, they could not interbreed. This situation illustrates the phenomenon of

A puddle of water has a thin film of gasoline floating on it. A beam of light is shining perpendicular on the film. If the wavelength of light incident on the film is 560 nm and the indices of refraction of gasoline and water are 1.40 and 1.33, respectively, what must be the minimum thickness of the film to see a bright reflection?  The index of refraction for air is 1.00

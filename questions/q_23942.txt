The officers of Wheeler Dealer Inc. are not tax experts but they have heard about planning "gain" years and "loss" years using IRC Section 1231.  This is very attractive to them in the current year because they want to sell a tract of land on which the corporation will recognize a gain of $83,000 as well as another tract of land on which it will recognize a loss of $46,000. Both of these properties have been used for the corporation's business operations for over five years.  Wheeler decides to recognize the $46,000 loss in the current year and the $83,000 gain next year.  If the plan is carried out exactly as described above and if the corporation has not disposed of any other property within the last 7 years, how much, if any, of the $83,000 gain will be characterized as ordinary income?

Competing Carp Two species of fish have coexisted in a lake for many years. Recently, the abundance of one species has started to decline. Some researchers blame the decline on a drop in the lake's oxygen concentration, resulting from global warming. To assess this hypothesis, the researchers conducted experiments to learn how the species respond to oxygen concentration. The figure below shows the information derived from these experiments. The parameter r1 is the intrinsic rate of increase for the declining species (species 1). The parameter K1 and K2 are the carrying capacities of species 1 and 2, respectively. The parameter a is the competitive effect of species 2 on species 1. Note that lower oxygen concentrations correspond to fewer parts per million (ppm).    Use this information and your knowledge about biology to answer questions 6-10.   6. The two species have completely different fundamental niches (no overlap).

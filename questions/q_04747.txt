Suppose you conducted a choice-based conjoint (CBC) study of running watches. You used three levels of Brand, Price, and Battery Life, and two levels of design. The choice proportions for the main effects of the attributes are as follows:    Brand Garmin 0.35    Apple 0.4    Coros 0.15   Design basic 0.2    attractive 0.5   Price $150 0.5    $350 0.25    $550 0.15   Battery Life 120 hours 0.45    90 hours  0.3    60 hours 0.15    Use this information to estimate the relative importance of Battery Life. (Answer as a percent and carry your work to the nearest tenth of a percent, e.g., 76.2%.)

WORKOUT PROBLEM starts here: (Nothing to submit here, just read the problem. Some of the homework format/layout is already provided) Consider a volcano that has a height, H. Video from an eruption shows a piece of solid rock which leaves the volcano at point a. The rock has an initial velocity of 256 m/s with the direction shown in the figure with an angle of 55deg from the vertical. It was recorded that at point b the rock reached a maximum height of ymax = 4366 m from the ground. x-y coordinate system  and the origin are shown in the figure. Ignore air resistance. Given: A rock thrown from volcano eruption.Find:   What are the components of the initial velocity?  How long does it take for the rock to reach the maximum height?  Determine the height H. What is the horizontal distance the rock hits the ground from the origin? What is the magnitude of the final velocity just before the rock hits the ground. Determine the angle at which the rock hits the ground.   Figure:

Write FIVE complete sentences in response to the following question:   ?Cuando tu eras nino/nina, que hacias?  "When you used to be a little boy/girl, what did you used to do?"    In order to receive full credit you must use a different verb in each sentence. Also, each sentence must give some context in order to be considered complete. For example, it is not enough to say "I used to eat" ... Tell me WHAT you used to eat... or WHERE you used to eat... or WHEN you used to eat... or WITH WHO you used to eat...   Hint: Pay attention to the conjugations of the verbs in the question. Are they in the Preterite or the Imperfect? This will help determine which conjugations you should use in your answer. For example, if the question is in the Imperfect, your answers should be in the Imperfect.   If you are unable to type accent marks, please capitalize the letters you wish to indicate as having an accent mark.  For example: If you are unable to type bebia please type it as bebIa If your answer is missing an accent mark (or is not typed in the manner described above) it WILL BE MARKED WRONG.

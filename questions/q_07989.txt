It then has branches that split off horizontally into the two renal arteries, passing to the kidneys. At a later depth, the aorta forks into the two lliac arteries to the legs. See figure. Blood density is 1060 kg/m3. In the healthy descending aorta, blood flows at 40.0 cm/s and the diameter of the aorta is about 1 inch.

Find the difference in pressure between these sections,

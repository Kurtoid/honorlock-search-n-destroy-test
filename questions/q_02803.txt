4. Below is a series of drawings showing possible cross sections of:Divergent,Continent-Ocean Convergent,Ocean-Ocean Convergent,and Continent-Continent Convergent boundaries.Each drawing is identified by a number, with various features in the drawings identified by one or two letters. Identify which of the drawings is each of these boundary types, and then identify (in the correctly chosen images) the features characteristic of those boundaries. In the drawings, there are 2 different thicknesses of crust, one thick, which is above sea level, and one thin, which is submerged. Red colors represent magma or volcanic structures.Green colors represent marine sediments.Gold X's refer to repeated events that happen where the X's are.The various color of other letters is just to allow you to see the differences. Hint: If for example, you choose drawings #1, 2, 3, and 4 as your different boundary types, then your answers for the different features should come ONLY from drawings #1 through 4.

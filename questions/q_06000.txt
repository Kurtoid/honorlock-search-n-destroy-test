Source E: For a long time, Britain was the leading industrial country and it provided a lot of wealth. Britain was also able to increase its power and wealth by gaining more control over other countries in the world. These lands became colonies, which together made up the great British Empire. Raw materials from British colonies were made into manufactured goods in British factories. These goods were sold around the world at a profit. Initially, other European countries, such as Germany, France, and Belgium, could not compete with Britain. Then they started copying British technology and building their own factories. Soon they began to compete with Britain for colonies in other parts of the world to supply raw materials for their factories and markets for their manufactured goods. Together Britain and Western Europe have the most powerful and rich part of the world as a result of the Industrial Revolution.

In June 2003, Florida passed legislation that permits students to graduate from high school with 18 credits instead of 24, effectively allowing students to graduate after their junior year. Subsequently, Colorado's legislature has proposed radical elimination of the 12th grade and the establishment of a year of preschool instead. At the heart of both states' attempted solutions is a fundamental question: What is senior year for? Compose an essay of approximately 500-750 words in which you argue at least two (2) reasons whether or not Louisiana should consider eliminating the 12th grade. This argument should be based on your own experience, knowledge you have gained from others, and at least TWO of the readings on the "Final Exam Quotations" Handout to support your opinion and/or to contrast their statements with your own ideas. The references may be direct quotations or paraphrases, and you must in-text cite your sources using MLA format within your essay to show which readings provided your information. No Works Cited Page is needed. Your essay must be your own composition, presenting your own ideas and not merely a patchwork of others' works and ideas. Your essay will be evaluated on your argument, and, in part, on how effectively the readings are used.

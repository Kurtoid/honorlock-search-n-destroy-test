Samples of testosterone and estradiol were submitted to a lab for analysis. The lab technician had to leave for lunch, and since both containers had different colored caps, she was confident that she would remember which sample was which. While at lunch, she ran into an old friend that she had not seen in years, and they chatted for several hours.  When the technician returned to the lab, she realized that she forgot which sample had which colored cap. The technician asks you to help figure out which sample is which. You have access to IR and HRMS data for each of these samples.

Questions 8-11. We will now consider factors predicting the top speed of the n=77 cars.  The relevant variables are:  TOPSPEED: Top speed of the car (in miles per hour) WEIGHT: Vehicle weight (in pounds) HORSEPOWER: Maximum horsepower of the car's engine    Summaries of two regressions predicting TOPSPEED are below:     Model 1: TOPSPEED regressed on WEIGHT Predicted TOPSPEED = 85.34 + 0.00788 WEIGHT R2 = .301   R2 (Adjusted) = .292    Residual Standard Deviation  = 8.69   Model 2: TOPSPEED regressed on WEIGHT and HORSEPOWER Predicted TOPSPEED = 96.17 - 0.00692 WEIGHT + 0.350 HORSEPOWER R2 = .951    R2 (Adjusted) = .944    Residual Standard Deviation  = 1.29

Fact Pattern 4 Thor and Penelope ("Pepper") von Beaverhausen were divorced in May 2015.  During the parties' marriage, Thor earned approximately $500,000 per year as an executive. While Pepper had a B.A. in education and a certification to teach, she earned minimal income substitute teaching because of Thor's income and the flexibility enabled her to attend to the parties' three children.    Despite their significant income, the parties lived relatively frugally in relation to their earnings and prioritized savings. They owned a nice, comfortable home, but nothing showy or extravagant.  They drove reliable older vehicles.  They budgeted living expenses on a monthly basis.  The parties did choose to send their children to private schools, an expense they felt was justified for the investment in their children's education. The parties settled their divorce relatively amicably.  The parties' divorce decree states as follows regarding spousal support: "Commencing June 1, 2015, Husband shall pay to Wife the sum of $10,000 per month as and for spousal support for a period of sixty (60) consecutive months.  Spousal support shall terminate upon the death of either party, Wife's remarriage or cohabitation."   Additionally, the parties' divorce decree states the following about child support:   "Commencing June 1, 2015, Husband shall pay to Wife the sum of $3,000 per month as and for child support.  Husband shall maintain the children on his health insurance policy so long as it is available through his employer. Husband shall be solely responsible for the cost of the children's private school tuition and all uncovered/ unreimbursed medical expenses." Now, in April 2020, Pepper learns that Thor's income has essentially doubled since their divorce (to approximately $1,000,000 per year).  Pepper retained the marital home, where she still resides with the minor children (during her parenting time).  The children still attend the same private schools, which Thor continues to pay for.  The children do participate in many extracurricular activities.  None of the children have any special medical needs. The costs for maintaining the former marital home are essentially unchanged. Pepper is furious when she comes to your office, irate that Thor has the benefit of so much income.  She insists that you must file motions with the Court to adjust her spousal support and child support tomorrow. 14. What do you tell Pepper about her likelihood of prevailing on a Motion to Modify Spousal Support? Why? (2 points; 75 word limit)

"When I was ten years old, I worked on my father's farm, digging, hoeing, and gathering and carrying our crop.  We had no horses because only officials are allowed to have horses in China. I worked on my father's farm until I was about sixteen years old, when a man from our clan came back from America. In America, he had purchased land about as large as four city blocks and made it into a paradise.  The man had left our village as a poor boy. Now he returned with unlimited wealth, which he had obtained in the country of the American wizards. The man's wealth filled my mind with the idea that I, too, would like to go to the country of the wizards and gain some of their wealth. After a long time, my father gave me his blessing and my mother took leave of me with tears. My father gave me some money and I went with five other boys from our village to take a steamship from Hong Kong. The engines that moved the ship were wonderful monsters, strong enough to lift mountains. When I got to San Francisco, I was half-starved because I was afraid to eat American food. But after a few days of living in the Chinese quarter, I was happy again. A man got me work as a servant with an American family and my start was the same as most of the Chinese in this country."

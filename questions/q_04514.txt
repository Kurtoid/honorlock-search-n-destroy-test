A hotel employee who was a fan of police crime shows brought room service food to a room. As the employee was bringing the trays of food into the room, he happened to notice that one of the occupants of the room was in the bathroom surrounded by what appeared to be bundles of cash and was counting out more cash. The other occupant hurried the hotel employee out of the room, but on his way out, the hotel employee saw several duffel bags that he suspected from his TV viewing held drugs. The hotel employee reported his observations to the hotel manager. The manager reported this information to his wife who was a police officer. The wife, suspecting that the duffel bags and cash indicated the sale of illegal drugs, told her husband to inspect the room when the occupants were out, and if he found anything suspicious, to bring it to her. Later that day when the occupants were out, the manager took the master key and went into the room. He found a few duffel bags and, looking inside, saw bags of white powder, some of which he took to his wife. The narcotics division confirmed that the powder was contraband. The wife told the manager to return the powder and swear out an affidavit. A search warrant was issued and the police arrested the occupants and searched their room. A quantity of drugs was found, and the occupants were charged with possession of illegal drugs for sale. If the occupants move to prevent evidence of the drugs from being introduced at trial, what should the court do?

You are designing a formulation processing step for a novel monoclonal antibody (MW = 147 kDa). You have total control over the way in which the protein will be formulated, but it should be formulated to2.25 g/L and should be in 3.6 mL aliquots.  The final liquid chromatography step will provide 1.75 g/L of product in a 200L pool.  Give a detailed description of how you would process this pool through to formulated protein product in the dosage vials.        (10 marks) Whilst scaling up the manufacturing process you discover that the final liquid chromatography step no longer clears a product related impurity (MW = 350 kDa). How would you approach solving this problem at the point of the formulation process?            (5 marks) Give a detailed overview of how you would conduct a temperature stability trial on the formulated antibody product. (5 marks)

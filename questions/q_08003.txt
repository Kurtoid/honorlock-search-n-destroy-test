There are two existing firms in the market for computer chips. Firm A knows how to reduce the production costs for the chip and is considering whether to adopt the innovation or not. Innovation incurs a fixed setup cost of C, while increasing the revenue. However, once the new technology is adopted, another firm, B, can adopt it with a smaller setup cost of C/2. If A innovates and B does not, A earns $30 in revenue while B earns $0. If A innovates and B does likewise, both firms earn $15 in revenue. If neither firm innovates, both earn $10. If C = 15, which is the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of the game? Clearly draw the extensive form game.

Question Two (One Hour and a Half)               The city of Wilson, like many others, has witnessed its share of allegations, many justifiable, of police misconduct, including the use of excessive force and the disrespectful treatment of particular individuals based on race, gender, class or sexuality.  In order to address the abuses and improve relations between the public and the police, while avoiding the reduction of police funding (which leaders believe will hurt the most disadvantaged neighborhoods), the city council believes only reform will increase public confidence in the police.             As a first step, the council has required that each police academy class (the city holds one each year, consisting of 50 cadets, who, if they successfully complete the academy regimen, are sworn in as city police officers) must be at least 75% non-male (thus nearly all female, but also including males transitioning to the female gender).  The city reasons, as over 91% of the alleged instances of police misconduct (the current force is 68% male--police departments are traditionally overwhelmingly male) involve male police officers, that males, even with improved training, are more pre-disposed, because of their native aggressiveness and culturally-rooted addiction to seeking predominance and their taste for violence, to abuse their authority.  Conversely, as an expert hired by the city has documented, women are more likely to avoid conflict, promote harmony, and seek peaceful solutions to disputes.  The city has concluded that a less male police force will commit fewer abuses and win public confidence.  Several males, however, who applied for admission to the police academy, and despite having received higher evaluation scores than several of the non-males admitted, were denied admission will sue.             The larger Wilson community is committed to making law enforcement more effective and just.  Wilson residents are fortunate that the University of Wilson, a private university, houses the Community Policing Center (CPC), one of the nation's leading academic centers on the evaluation and reform of police practices.  The CPC has pioneered the study and analysis of allegations of police misconduct and its reports concerning whether the actions of individual officers were consistent with best policing practices are the best in the industry.  In Wilson itself, the CPC possesses an excellent reputation with both civil rights organizations and the leaders of the Black and Latino communities as a fair and thorough evaluator of police practices.             In response to demands of these organizations and leaders to make more use of the CPC's resources, the city has contracted to pay the CPC to, upon request from an alleged victim of a police encounter, to investigate the encounter and write a report analyzing the officer's actions and evaluate whether the officer's actions were consistent with both the Wilson police department's regulations and best policing practices.  (The CPC will receive a flat, contracted fee for each investigation conducted.)  If an alleged victim chooses to ask the CPC investigate the incident, at the expense of the city, they must waive their right to a police department investigation of the incident.  In turn, the city has agreed that, if the CPC concludes that the officer's actions warrant termination from the force, the city will proceed with its own termination process against the officer.  (The city's separate termination process provides officers with notice and a full hearing before a decision is made.  The police department's employment policies state that no officer will be terminated without cause, including misconduct in violation of the department's policies.  Such cause shall not be found without a full and thorough review by the department, including an opportunity for the officer's side to be heard.)              The city, the CPC, and the affected communities are happy with the agreement.  The Wilson police officers are not.  Their concern is that the CPC investigators have a strict policy, in conducting their inquiry, of not speaking to the officer accused.  They do interview the alleged victim and any potential witnesses, but the only submission from the officer they will consider is the digital recordings of the incident from the officer's required body camera.  The officers are furious that their testimony is not deemed sufficiently trustworthy to even be considered.   The CPC is adamant that their record of excellence demonstrates that their conclusion that, most often, the officer's testimony distorts the issues is correct.               In particular, Phil Bruce, an officer with over 30 years of experience, was the subject of a CPC investigation, which concluded, without, despite his repeated pleas, interviewing him, that he used excessive force to arrest a suspect.  The CPC report recommended termination, and the city police board, after holding its own hearing (which included Bruce's testimony), decided to fire him.  Bruce believes that once the CPC made its report (which was admitted into evidence into the termination proceeding and the CPC's director of the investigation was the principal witness in favor of firing him) that, no matter what else he said or presented, the city board was going to vote to fire him.  (To date, every officer recommended by the CPC for termination was ultimately terminated by the city.)  He believes the only chance he had to show why he believed he needed to use the force exerted was to testify to the CPC, because, they are, in effect, the decision making body.  He will sue the city for the denial of his rights.             It is important to note that the Wilson city council is also keen on protecting the vast majority of its police officers who are conscientiously serving the public.  Since both the local and national explosion of reports of police misconduct, there are a few individuals who, when police are involved in an incident in which misconduct is claimed, have somehow, sometimes through department leaks or deceitful inquiries to the department, obtained the home addresses, phone numbers, and private e-mail addresses of police officers.  This personal information is then published online, sometimes by those who obtained the information and sometimes by others who were given the information by those who obtained it, resulting, in several instances, of stalking and harassment, both online and in-person, of police officers and their families.             To put a stop to this inexcusable abuse, the city council has passed an ordinance forbidding anyone, with the intent of using this information to facilitate the harassment or stalking of police or their families (known as "doxxing"), from obtaining or attempting to obtain from the agency, without disclosing their purpose, private identifying information, including address of residence, private telephone numbers, or private e-mail addresses.  (The law does not address information obtained from public sources, such as Google searches or telephone listings.)                  Tom Hoffman, a "blogger for justice", who has successfully obtained this information and published it online denies that he intends to harass these police officers.  He believes that he, and other citizens, both have a right to communicate their thoughts and feelings to these officers just as they do to any employee that serves the public, and that they have a right to know and publicly discuss where police officers live because it may explain their racist attitudes.  Hoffman intends to continue to obtain and distribute this information; thus, he will challenge the law.             Hoffman's comrade in protest, Bobby Hayden, has taken his anger to another level.  He, while accompanying Hoffman in recording the actions of a police officer they believed to be abusive, stood in the officer's face and yelled "We're going to tell everyone who you are!  They'll be no place for your shit family to hide!  We will find where your little brownshirts go to school!  You should all get out now!"  The other officers on the scene, overhearing this tirade, quickly (before the targeted officer could advance on Hayden) carried Hayden off.  He was arrested for violating an ordinance which states, in pertinent part: "Disorderly conduct includes the utterance of words that would incite a reasonable person hearing the statement to commit immediate violence against the speaker."  Hayden will challenge his prosecution.             You are an Assistant State Attorney General.  Write a memo to your supervisor analyzing all the constitutional issues regarding: both the lawsuits of the male applicants' and of Bruce against the city; Hoffman's challenge to the anti-doxxing law; and Hayden's prosecution.   Make sure you fully explain both the constitutional bases for any causes of action, as well as the legal defenses that can be raised against the claims. Do not discuss areas of law not covered in this course.

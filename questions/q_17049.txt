A 1992 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported body temperature, gender, and heart rate for a number of subjects. The sample average temperature for 25 female subjects was 98.2 degrees and the sample standard deviation was 0.7 degrees.  This question is part of a quiz or exam given at Arizona State University, copywritten by Dr. L. Chattin.  It may not be reproduced, posted or distributed without permission of Arizona State University and L. Chattin.  If you use a hypothesis test to determine if the population mean female body temperature is greater than 98.6 degrees, the test statistic is [x] and the p-value is [y].  If P(Type I error) = 0.01, your conclusion is [z].  Select the answers closest to yours.

For the following problem, use a separate sheet of paper to solve the problem and then upload your solution at the following link: https://canvas.dccc.edu/courses/28279/assignments/560402 Your work must be shown for full credit.  The answer alone is only worth 1 point.    A solution is prepared by dissolving 7.00 g of glycerin (C3H8O3) in 201 g of ethanol (C2H5OH). The freezing point of pure ethanol is -114.6degC at 1 atm. The molal-freezing-point-depression constant (Kf) for ethanol is 1.99degC/m. The molar masses of glycerin and of ethanol are 92.1 g/mol and 46.1 g/mol, respectively. Calculate the freezing point of the solution.

George has been employed by Client Corp. for the last 3 1/2  years. George participates in Client's 401(k) plan. During his employment, George has contributed $6,000 to the 401(k) account. Client has contributed $3,000 to George's 401(k) account (it matched 50 cents of every dollar contributed). George is considering quitting his job with SEC, calculate his vested benefit in the 401(k) account (assume the account balance is $12,000)? a. Client uses a three-year cliff vesting schedule b. Client uses a 6 year Graded vesting schedule.
Remember, once time runs out, it is too late to upload your Simio file without significant penalty in points.  You need to stop your test a few minutes before time runs out to insure that you have time to upload your Simio (.spfx) file. Only two pages of single-sided notes are allowed.  The only scratch paper are the two pages you have for notes.  Hand held calculators are allowed, but not your cell phone.  Do not use the Math.If( ) function. When you are finished, close Simio, then upload the Simio (.spfx) file before time runs out.  Only one upload is allowed. Problem Description Truck arrivals (make these green colored entities) occur at 6AM each day.  The daily truck contains exactly 10 parts 50% of the time and exactly 14 parts 50% of the time.  Since the truck arrives at 6AM, make your stating time of your simulation to be 6AM.   In addition to parts arriving by truck, there are individually arriving parts (make these red colored entities) that have exponentially distributed inter-arrival times where the mean inter-arrival time depends on the time of day (in other words, the arrival process of red entities is a non-stationary Poisson process).  Specifically, between 6AM and noon the mean time between arrivals is 20 minutes, between noon and 6PM the mean time between arrivals is 10 minutes, and between 6PM and 6AM the mean time between arrivals is 30 minutes. All parts first go to a batch processor.  This batch processor services two parts at a time and the processing time has a Pert distribution with parameters 20, 25, and 30 minutes.  Both parts in the batch must have the same color (i.e., truck arrivals are always paired with truck arrivals and individual arrivals are always paired with other individual arriving parts).  The batch processor has a queueing priority system, namely, red parts have non-preemptive priority over green parts.  For verification purposes, you should animate the batches so a visual check can be made that the batches sizes are two and both parts in the batch are the same color. After the batch processor, all parts are processed through a single-server processor that treats each part individually (i.e., the batches do not stay together as a unit after the batch processor).  The processing time at the single-server processor for each individual green entity is exponentially distributed with mean 15 minutes and for each individual red entity is exponentially distributed with mean 12 minutes.  After the single-server processor, all parts leave the system.  The following travel times are 5 minutes:  (1) from green source to the batch processor, (2) from red source to the batch processor, (3) from the batch processor to the single-server processor, and (4) from the single-server processor to the exit of the system. All assignment statements and tallies must be done through Processes.  Run the simulation for 50 days with only one replication (i.e., no experiment and no warmup period) and estimate the following based on the 50 days:  (1) The average total number of individual parts in the system at 7AM (note that this is one number including both green and red parts), (2) the total daily throughput of parts for the system, and (3) the average time (in minutes) that a red part that arrives between 6AM and noon spends in the system.  (Note that (3) is the TIS per part averaged only over those parts that are red and arrive to the system in the morning.)  These three values must appear in the Results tab.  In a floor label, give the expected (i.e., theoretical) value for the daily throughput.  Note:  We have not used a queueing priority discipline for a batch processor before; however, you should be able to figure it out by searching for an appropriate property of the combiner.

"In theory, all of the peoples of the world, though different in their degree of civilization and enlightenment are created equal and are brothers before God. As universal love advances, the theory goes, and as the regulations of international law are put into place, the entire world will soon be at peace. This theory is currently espoused mainly by Western Christian ministers or by persons who are enamored of that religion. However, when we leave this fiction and look at the facts regarding international relations today, we find them shockingly different. Do nations honor treaties? We find not the slightest evidence that they do. When countries break treaties, there are no courts to judge them. Therefore, whether a treaty is honored or not depends entirely on the financial and military powers of the countries involved. Money and soldiers are not for the protection of existing principles; they are the instruments for the creation of principles where none exist. There are those moralists who would sit and wait for the day when all wars would end. Yet in my opinion the Western nations are growing ever stronger in the skills of war. In recent years, these countries devise strange new weapons and day by day increase their standing armies. One can argue that that is truly useless, truly stupid. Yet if others are working on being stupid, then I must respond in kind. If others are violent, then I too must become violent. International politics is the way of force rather than the way of virtue--and we should accept that." Yukichi Fukuzawa, Japanese intellectual, Commentary on the Current Problems, 1881 Ideas similar to those expressed in the passage would contribute most directly to which of the following?

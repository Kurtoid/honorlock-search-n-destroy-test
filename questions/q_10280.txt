A client is diagnosed with degenerative disc disease. Which form of physical therapy will reduce the movement of the spine and enhance the healing process?
An experiment was performed by a veterinary laboratory of the Canadian Department of Agriculture due to several cases of baby ducklings mysteriously dying after being in cabbage patches that contain cabbage worms.  Three types of ducklings were secured (Mallards, Pintails, and Canvasbacks), two broods of each.  Each brood was then split into two equal groups as much alike as possible.  For a one-week period they were provided an approved diet for ducklings.  All had this diet, except that half of each brood were provided something more:  two cabbage worms daily per duckling.  The condition of the ducklings at the end of the week was observed and is reported in the following table:                 Type of Duckling        Original Number in Brood        Regular Diet        Regular Diet Plus Worms                          Healthy        Ill        Dead        Healthy        Ill        Dead          Mallard        8        3        1                        2        2          6        3                                        3          Pintail        6        2                1                        3          8        3        1                1                3          Canvasback        8        4                                1        3          8        3        1                        1        3          Total        44        18        3        1        1        4        17              Question 8:  It is discovered that both sets of ducklings reached through their cages and drank water from a little ditch that ran past both cages.

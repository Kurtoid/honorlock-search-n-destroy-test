I hope you enjoyed this unusual synchronous history class in a crazy pandemic year!  As we get back to normal, I also hope that you will keep learning history: US and world.  And don't forget to ask questions as you visit history museums, read  history books, or watch a movies and documentaries.  Of one thing I am certain, learning about the past can teach you to see things in new ways, to learn about different people and the struggles they faced and choices they made -- sometimes good, and sometimes not so good.   Life is complicated and challenging, and knowing this will make you a better leader and perhaps a more empathetic person in the future!  I have faith in you (: Good luck to all.

Another friend wants to implement a script to find the two solutions to the equation: 2x2-5x+1 = 0 To do this, he writes an Octave script to calculate the solutions, using the quadratic formula, in a script called, mysolutions.m 1 a = 2;2 b = -5;3 c = 1;4 soln1 = (-b+sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(2a);5 soln2 = (-b-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(2a);6 fprintf('The solutions are %5.2f and %5.2f.', soln1, soln2); The numbers at the beginning of the lines are line numbers, they aren't part of the script. When he runs the program, he gets the following output: >> mysolutionsparse error near line 4 of file mysoln.msyntax errorsoln1 = (-b+sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(2a); ^ Help him with his code by: (a) explaining what that error means (b) why is she getting that error, and (c) suggest a correction to the code that will fix that error.  Start each part of your answer with the corresponding letter.

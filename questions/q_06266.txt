Write the half-cell reactions for question #1 as reductions. The reduction half-cell potential for hypochlorous acid into phosphine is - 0.780 V.     Then find the standard reduction potentials for the half-reactions.    Then label the half-reactions as reduction or oxidation.    Then calculate the overall standard cell potential.

Consider the code fragment given below for reading in some exam marks and print the number of passes, the number of fails, the pass rate, and the average mark. During unit testing, the programmer notices that the test cases fail with incorrect average values. Now the programmer is required to enter the debugging process to identify the cause of these failures. Assume that manually examining all the lines of code in this code fragment to identify the fault is not feasible due to resource constraints. Suggest a method to improve the efficiency of the debugging process and locate the fault faster by reducing the number of lines of code that need to be examined manually by leveraging the analysis techniques discussed in the class.

Consider the loop transfer function L(s) whose Bode plot is shown below. Then answer a bunch of questions about it below.    It is desired that, when we close the loop, the amplitude of the steady-state error should be at most 1% of the amplitude of the reference for frequencies below 0.005 rad/s. [A] At the same time, it is desired that, when we close the loop, noise is attenuated by a factor of 1000 for frequencies above 1 rad/s. [B] Will the closed-loop system be stable. (Hint: it is easier to see using phase margin.) [C] Is the DC gain of L(s) positive or negative? [D] What is the relative degree of L(s)? [E] Are there any poles or zeros at the origin? [F] Are there any obvious complex poles or zeros in the system? [G]

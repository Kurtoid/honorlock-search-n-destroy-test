Consider a test suite consisting of three deterministic tests T1, T2, T3 for a correct program P. Since P is correct, it passes all the three tests. Suppose we have three mutants M1, M2, M3 of P such that: M1 fails T1 and T2; M2 fails none; and M3 fails T2 and T3. Let M = P denote that M and P are equivalent. Likewise, let M != P denote that they are NOT equivalent. Could it be possible that M1 = P?

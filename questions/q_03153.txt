Essay #1: Write a short essay (at least two substantial paragraphs) analyzing one of the passages below. Include the following:  What is going on in the passage? For example, who is doing what?

Passage B: "This was the lair of a huge creature, a man who pastured his flocks off by himself, and lived apart from others and knew no law.

All that pain is nothing to what I will feel, when some bronze-armored Greek leads you away in tears, on your first day of slavery." Passage D: "It is up to you," she said, "to punish the man as he deserves. As for me, I absolve myself of wrong, but not from punishment. Let no unchaste woman hereafter continue to live because of the precedent of [name]"

Q5- (10 points)  In order to implement the classic DoS flood attack on IoT devices, the attacker must generate a sufficiently large volume of packets to exceed the capacity of the link to the target organization. Consider an IoT DoS attack using ICMP echo request (ping) packets that are 500 bytes in size (ignoring framing overhead).  Show all the math to get full credit for each sub-question below.  (a) (4 points)  How many of these packets per second must the attacker send to flood a target organization using a 0.5-Mbps link? (b) (3 points) How many per second if the attacker uses a 2-Mbps link? (c) (3 points) How many per second if the attacker uses a10-Mbps link?

The new nurse is auscultating the patient's posterior lung fields and determines the right and left lobe bases to have abnormal, popping like sounds heard on expiration. How would the nurse document this finding?
A report states that the mean household income last year for a certain rural county was $46,500 and the median was $37,600. If a histogram were constructed for the incomes of all households in the county, would you expect it to be skewed to the right, to the left, or approximately symmetric?  https://www-awn.connectmath.com/pdf/Navidi_Formulas.pdf https://www-awn.connectmath.com/pdf/Navidi_App_A_Tables.pdf

3. PAC Learning (20 points)    Consider the hypothesis class Hs2 "symmetric, depth two decision trees over n boolean variables". Each hypothesis in Hs2 is a decision tree of depth two (i.e., a tree with four leaves, all distance two from the root) where the left and right child of the root must be the same variable. The example to the right should help you visualize Hs2. Assume that there are only two classes. (a) As a function of n, how many syntactically distinct trees are there in Hs2? Two trees are syntactically distinct if they "look" different, even if they compute the same function. Explain your answer. (b) Give a bound for the number of examples needed in the PAC model to learn any target concept in Hs2 for some error e and confidence d. (c) As a function of n, how many semantically distinct trees are there in Hs2? Two trees are semantically distinct only if they compute different functions. Explain your answer. (d) Now give a tighter bound for the number of examples needed to learn any target concept in Hs2. Feel free to use latex-like style equations or describe the equation in words. For example, use delta for d and epsilon for e. Clearly mark your answers with (a), (b), (c) and (d).

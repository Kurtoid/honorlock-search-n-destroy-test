Skill E2.  (This example is based on a case described by Gold, 2013.)  Louis is considering installing solar panels on the roof of his house in Sun City, Arizona.  If he goes forward, he will pay the installation firm $16,800 but will save money on his electric bill. The amount he will save depends upon the availability of the solar panels. Every day of sun will save him $3.50 if the solar panels do not fail and are available 100% of the time; because Sun City gets 295 days of sunshine of year, the maximum total savings over 20 years is $20,650.  The availability of the solar panels is uncertain because it depends upon the number of defects created during their manufacturing; based on his research into this type of solar panel, Louis estimates the probability distribution of their availability as follows: the probability of 50% availability is 15%; the probability of 75% availability is 25%; the probability of 90% availability is 40%; and the probability of 100% availability of sun is 20%.  His total savings equals the availability times $20,650.  Louis is risk-neutral and will choose to install solar panels if the expected gain (savings minus installation cost) is positive.  What is the expected value of perfect information about solar panel availability?

(2+6+2+6=16 pts) A multiple linear regression model was built, based on observations from crime rate data (measured as number of offenses per million population) and a variety of variables by US state (N=47). The results are shown below ("DV" means "dummy variable").

What is the R2 for this model? What does it mean in plain English? b.  What do the coefficient and p-value of "Expenditure on police" mean in plain English, for a state with a population of 1 million? Is the coefficient reasonable?  If not, why not, and what should be done about it? c.  For the model specified as shown, should we worry about collinearity? Why or why not? d. For a state with a crime rate of 120 offenses per million population and an expenditure on police of $104 per capita, what is the point elasticity of crime rate with respect to expenditure on police? Is this inelastic, unit elastic, or elastic? What does the number mean in plain English? Answer the same questions for a state with a crime rate of 80 offenses per million population and an expenditure on police of $120 per capita.

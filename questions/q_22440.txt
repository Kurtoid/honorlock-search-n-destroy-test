A car in an amusement park is launched on a rollercoaster by a gigantic spring as shown in the figure above. The spring constant is 200 kN/m, (1kN/m=1000 N/m) and the initial compression of the spring is 120 cm. The mass of the coaster together with the passengers is 2000 kg. Point B is at the top of a circular loop of radius 10.0 m. When the cart is reaching the top of the loop, its speed is 11.0 m/s. a) (3p) What the initial potential energy of the compressed gigantic spring? Show work! (type in) b) (6p) What is the mechanical energy of the cart at point B? Show work! (type in) c) (4p) What is the work done by non-conservative forces during time interval the cart is moving from point A to point B? Show work! (type in) d) (6p) What is the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the track on the cart at point B? Show work! (type in) e) (6p) If the non-conservative forces do the same amount of work when the cart is moving from point B to point C as when the cart is moving from point A to point B, what is the speed of the cart at point C?

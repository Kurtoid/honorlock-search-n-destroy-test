(2 pts) We have the circuit shown here...  In this figure, some currents, EMF sources, and resistors take the following values   = 1.00 A,  = [E2].00 V,  = [E3].00 V,  = [R1].00 O,  = [R2].00 O,  = [R3].00 O, and  = [R4].00 O.  The currents are positive if in the direction indicated. The unknown  is positive if the polarity is as illustrated here. Negative values are fine, they just indicate that the pictured current is the wrong way or the pictured EMF has a different polarity. You won't calculate this initially, but give your value for  here in units of mA. Be sure to include the sign if appropriate.

You have a 10 gram ice cube at a temperature of -20 degrees Celsius.  Fill in the blanks to show your work as you calculate the amount of thermal energy that must be exchanged to vaporize this ice cube.   Even though they are different in reality, please assume that the Specific Heat Capacity of water is the same for all of its phases. e., assume HCsolid = HCliquid = HCvapor = 1 cal/g/0C. Latent Heat of Vaporization = 540 cal/g Latent Heat of Fusion = 80 cal/g Pay attention to the units and understand if you're being asked for "calories," or "calories per gram," or "degrees," etc. Enter numeric values only. g., if the answer is seven, you would enter "7" not "seven." Do not enter any commas or decimal points. If the answer is one thousand, enter "1000" not "1,000" or "1000.0" etc. Do not enter any negative numbers. You are being asked to calculate the "total amount of energy that must be exchanged" so there is no need to use negative numbers.  DT for this transformation = [value1] 0C. Sensible Heat Required per gram for this transformation = [value2] cal/g. Total Sensible Heat Required for this transformation = [value3] cal. The phase change the water goes through requires [value4] cal/g. Total Latent Heat required for this transformation = [value5] cal. Total amount of Thermal Energy required to make this transformation = [value6] cal.

Instructions: Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.        (1) Some mixed-breed dogs that would once have been referred to as mutts are now enjoying a new status as popular and expensive "designer dogs." (2) For instance, the labradoodle, a cross between a Labrador and a poodle that can cost up to $4,000, is one sought-after combination. (3) Other popular "doodle" dogs include the schnoodle (a schnauzer-poodle mix) and the goldendoodle (a golden retriever-poodle mix). (4) Many dog lovers are willing to plunk down large sums for a cockapoo (a cocker spaniel-poodle mix) or a yorkipoo (a combination of a Yorkshire terrier and a poodle). (5) Even England's Queen Elizabeth is fond of a specialty mixed-breed known as the dorgi, a cross between a dachshund and a corgi.   Select the number of the sentence containing a transitional expression that introduces an illustration.

Respiratory alkalosis is a clinical feature of overdose ingestion of salicylate because
(20 Points) A single part is made by two different sequential processes: shearing and bending. The demand for this part is 100,000 units per week. The company operates 6 days per week, 8 hours per day, one shift per day. Each process has parts that are defective but can be reworked. Given the following performance data, find the number of each machine needed to meet the demand. Notice the time units are in seconds! (a) [10 points] What are the input of parts to each process required to meet demand? (b) [10 points] How many bending and shearing machines are necessary to meet demand?

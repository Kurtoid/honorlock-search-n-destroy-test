You are analyzing DNA to determine which suspect was at a crime scene with a victim. You have PCR amplified short tandem repeats (STRs) from the samples and separated them via gel electrophoresis to perform "DNA fingerprinting" as follows. DNA sources are noted above each lane: Victim (Lane 1), Suspect 1 (Lane 2), Suspect 2 (Lane 3), and Crime Scene (Lane 4). DNA was loaded into wells at the top of the gel, near the lane-labels  (i.e. "Victim", etc.).

Problem Statement   Sara, Lauren, and Margaret are computer programmers working for a small company that develops video games.  They need to determine how many hours each person will spend working on a new project so that it can be completed with minimum cost. The hours each programmer spends on the project is denoted by xi, where Sara is 1, Lauren is 2, and Margaret is 3.  The project requires a minimum number of hours by a programmer with special qualifications, a fixed number of development hours, and must achieve a certain quality for the first draft of the project. The LP to determine how many hours each programmer should work has already been written and solved.  The model and optimal solution are given below.   min        15x1 + 22x2 + 19x3                                                          Optimal Solution st            0x1   + x2      + x3 >= 10                                                                  xB  =[ x1,x3, e1 ]                4x1   + 2x2    + 6x3 = 250                                                                x1 = 25/2                8x1   + 9x2  +   6x3 >= 300                                                              x2 = 0                x1, x2, x3 >= 0                                                                                    x3 =  100/3                                                                                                                      B-1 = [    0              -1/4        1/4                                                                                                                                 0              1/3         -1/6                                                                                                                                 -1            1/3         -1/6]

SPSS is to be used to construct a multiple regression model for a data set with two independent variables (x1 and x2) and dependent variable y. Before analyzing the model, diagnostics were generated to check underlying assumptions. Use the scatterplot below to check the assumptions that can be check from this graph.      The scatterplot of the standardized residuals against the standardized predicted values indicates [a1]. Thus, the assumption of [a2] is met. The scatterplot also shows that the variance in the residuals [b1] across all predicted values. Thus, the assumption of [b2] is met.

Three kinds of tickets are available for a concert: "up close", "in the middle", and "nosebleed". "Up close" tickets cost $25 more than "in the middle" tickets. "In the middle" tickets cost $35 more than "nosebleed" tickets. Twice the cost of an "up close" ticket is $60 more than 6 times the cost of a "nosebleed" ticket.

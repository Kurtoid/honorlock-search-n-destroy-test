The NFL Scouting Combine is a week-long showcase that takes place every February, where college football players perform physical and mental tests in front of National Football League coaches, general managers, and scouts. Athletes attend by invitation only and their performance during the combine can affect their draft status and salary, and ultimately their career. The plot below uses data from the 2014 combine and presents the regression analysis of the time to run the 40yd dash (in seconds) on the player's weight.                      The response variable is: [response]   What is the best interpretation of the slope? [slope]   What is the best interpretation of the y intercept? [intercept] What does the line predict for x=200? [predict] There is one player on the data set with weight of 223 pounds and 40yd dash time of 5.26 seconds. What is his residual? [resid] [Rsquared] of the variability in 40yd dash run time has been explained by the player's weight.  What is the correlation between weight and 40yd dash time?  [corr] We can use the regression equation to predict 40yd dash time for a person who weighs 100 pounds but this would be considered: [caution]

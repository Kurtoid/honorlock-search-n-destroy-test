On the Excel spreadsheet, there are two matrices (Matrix A and Matrix B) highlighted in yellow on the "Exam2-Q51" tab). Complete the following matrix operations: (1) Calculate [C]=[A]*[B] using "MMULT" function in the designated blue area; (2) Calculate the Determinant of Matrix A using "MDETERM" function in the designated blue area; (3) Get the transpose of Matrix A using a VBA program; (4) On the "Exam2-Q52" tab, calculate [C]=[A]*[B] using a VBA program.   You will need to use "option base 1" in matrix or array VBA programs. The algorithm for the transpose of a matrix [A] is: Transpose matrix AT (j,i) = A (i,j)   The algorithm for matrix multiplication is: For i = 1 to (number)             For j = 1 to (number)                         For k = 1 to (number)                                  C (i,j) = C (i,j) + A (i,k)* B (k,j)                         Next k             Next j Next i Note: The first two sub-questions, (1) and (2), are Excel spreadsheet problems, and no programming is required. The code/formulas should be written such that values in blue change correctly if the values in yellow change and the code is re-executed. Once complete, please type a one-word essay (e.g., "ok") for this question and then upload your combined Excel file at the very end of this exam.

An experiment investigated whether cell phone use changes drivers' reaction times.  College students were randomly allocated to a cell phone group or a control group.  The experiment measures subjects' response times (in milliseconds) in a driving simulation.  For the cell phone group, the sample mean time was 585.2, the sample standard deviation was 89.6, and the sample size was 32.  For the control group, the sample mean time was 533.7, the sample standard deviation was 65.3, and the sample size was 32. The null hypothesis is that the mean reaction times are equal. Which is the appropriate alternative hypothesis for this investigation?

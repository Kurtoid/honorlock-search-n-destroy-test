Bob, a prolific shoe buyer, refuses to be assisted by male store clerks. The owner of Slipper Town, therefore, informs his staff that only female employees should attend to Bob because he does not want to anger a patron of his store. One of the male clerks, Larry, believes that this is illegal gender discrimination. Also, since part of his incentive pay is based on meeting the monthly sales target, he feels that this policy illegally denies him the opportunity to earn incentives because of his gender. Is Larry correct?
1) Suppose there is heat transfer of 50.00 J to a system, while the system does 20.00 J of work. Later, there is heat transfer of 35.00 J out of the system while 5.00 J of work is done on the system. What is the net change in internal energy of the system? (10 points)   2) What is the change in internal energy of a system when a total of 170.00 J of heat transfer occurs out of (from) the system and 160.00 J of work is done on the system?  (5 points)   3) This is a multiple choice question. Choose the correct answer, and write it on your worksheet. (5 points) The first law of thermodynamics applies A) the conservation of momentum principle to heat systems B)  the conservation of energy principle to heat systems C) the conservation of charge principle to heat systems D) the conservation of angular momentum principle to heat systems   4) 5000 J of heat transferred into a heat engine. If the heat loss to the environment is 450 J, how much is the work done by the engine? (5 points)

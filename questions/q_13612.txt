Antibodies that bind with high affinity to some viral surface proteins require heavy chain CDR3 loops of unusual length. Whereas the average human heavy chain CDR3 length is ~15 amino acids, antibodies with VH CDR3 loops of >30 amino acids are readily detected in the repertoire. These antibody heavy chains with CDR3 lengths of >30 amino acids would most likely be missing in individuals (who otherwise make functional antibodies) lacking what gene(s)?

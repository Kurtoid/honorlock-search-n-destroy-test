Exam Case  Beginning in the 1930s, the diamond company De Beers launched a marketing campaign that would make diamonds synonymous with engagement rings: giving diamonds to movie stars for their proposals, placing them in society publications and even bringing lecturers to high schools to talk about diamonds. In the 1940s, it launched its now famous "A Diamond Is Forever" campaign. But a global economic recession, combined with slow sales across the industry, has left De Beers looking for ways to recoup its lost revenue. De Beers has invested in lab-grown diamond technology since the late 1950s, but not until recently has the brand viewed them as a viable marketing alternative to their mined counterparts. And, it was clear that the window of opportunity to be a brand leader in lab-grown diamonds had narrowed over time. The lab-grown process uses a tiny diamond, called a diamond seed (which is sometimes from a mined diamond and sometimes from a lab-grown one), and one of two techniques to form a new diamond. The two processes used to create them --either high pressure-high temperature or chemical vapor deposition-- replicate the conditions that create diamonds underground, but at a much faster rate. (Natural diamonds are considered a finite resource because of the limited supply close enough to the earth surface to access.) Growing a one-carat diamond takes 7 to 10 days, while a three-carat diamond requires about a month. After, they are cut into traditional shapes such as cushion, oval, and round. Recently, a new crop of primarily online, direct-to-consumer jewelry brands offering engagement rings with lab-grown diamonds has emerged, challenging the traditional notion that the most treasured pieces of jewelry should have stones that come from the earth. Some also use recycled diamonds, which can refer to both antique stones themselves, as well as those that are recut into a modern shape. Unlike lab grown diamonds, recycled stones usually cost the same as their mined counterparts, but jewelry makers and their customers like them because of their smaller environmental footprint. In addition to Frank Darling, brands in the market include New York-based C1V1L, Ceremony in Los Angeles, and London-based Kimai, which counts Meghan Markle as a fan.  Private equity firms like Huron Capital, which investing WD Lsab Grown Diamonds in Washington, D.C., are betting on the trend. And celebrities to: Leonardo DiCaprio invested in San Francisco-based Diamond Foundry when the company raised over $100 million in 2015.   Increased concerns from consumers about the effect of diamond mining on the cultures and landscapes of the countries they come from also are driving industry trends. To address the ethical concerns that mined diamonds can finance violence by rebel movements, most mining companies certify their diamonds with the Kimberley Process, which came from a United Nations General Assembly resolution in 2000 to create an international standard for rough diamonds to ensure their conflict free. Critics of the certification say by only focusing on conflict demands, it skirts other forms of worker exploitation, including child labor and fair pay, and that it's tracking stops after a stone is cut and polished. Some jewelry companies implement their own standards in addition to the Kimberley process, like the De Beers group, which create their own best practice principles. Those sets of standards include additional human rights and labor regulations, as well as using their own tracking programs to oversee their diamonds until they reach their stores. Understanding the exact environmental impact of lab grown versus natural diamonds isn't entirely clear. A BBC future planet report from earlier this year tried to assess whether lab grown processes are cleaner than mining without arriving at a definitive conclusion, citing a lack of transparency that makes it hard to get accurate data on the carbon footprint of each. A 2014 analysis by the consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, for example, found that mined diamonds require more than twice as much energy as those grown in a lab, which is a significant amount of energy. Craft was important to Martin-Thompsen, 45, an architect and assistant dean and professor, as were the ethics behind her engagement ring. "I was really frustrated with how vague people sometimes were about their procurement process with diamonds," she says. "I just couldn't live with knowing that for me to have a beautiful object, I was going to potentially be harming other people or harming the earth." Some younger buyers don't want all the preciousness that's usually involved with buying an engagement ring; they find it intimidating and impersonal. The website of Frank Darling, the brand where architect Martin-Thomsen found her ring, is branded with playful art and blue font and makes ring shopping less of a momentous event. Customers scroll through their setting choices, select a material--either 18K yellow, white or rose gold, or platinum--their ring size and whether they'd like lab-grown or recycled diamonds. If they choose to buy one of the setting-only rings, they can then search through the company's diamond database to see stone options. Customers are also able to opt for a customized ring, as well as to start with a home try-on kit that includes four styles of replica rings. "It's a category most people have never shopped before, and walking into a jewelry store is intimidating," says co-founder and CEO Kegan Fisher, 34, who launched the company with her husband Jeff Smith, 38, in 2019. "In your home, where it's comfortable, nobody's looking at you and you can take as many photos as you want. It's low pressure."  And for millennials, notorious for prioritizing experiences over things, the price tag might be the biggest selling point of all. Fisher says, "You could spend twice as much money for the benefit of [the diamond] being dug out of the ground, or you could not do that, and you could go on a nicer honeymoon."

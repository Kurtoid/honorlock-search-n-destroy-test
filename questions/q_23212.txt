Study the body of the following paragraph. Then, select the letter of the topic sentence that is most accurate.      When two people discuss complex or serious issues, they need to be able to explain themselves fully. An exchange of brief text messages forces them to limit their vocabulary and the length of their statements, so they are less likely to express their complete meaning to one another. In a conversation about an important matter, people also need to be able to convey their moods and emotions to each other. Communicating via text messages eliminates the nonverbal channels--facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language--that express feelings, so texting often inhibits emotional connection. If the conversation becomes an argument, the deficiencies of text messaging can not only prevent a resolution of the conflict but also make it worse.

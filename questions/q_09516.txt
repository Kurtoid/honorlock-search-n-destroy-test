In a biomedical engineering company, which produces vital signal measurement devices a heart rate monitoring system was produced to help senior citizens with information about heart rate irregularities. This device sends an alert to the patient and the doctor, in case of any heart rate irregularity. A sample data set from the people who are using this device was collected to investigate the effect of age on the number of heart rate irregularities a user observes in a month. All the subjects are completely healthy and are not suffering from any chronical disease. If the increase in heart rate irregularities per month is less than 0.2 per 1-year increase in the age of the patients, the engineers in this company cannot consider age as a significant parameter which affects the heartrate irregularity. What would be your decision about effect of age on monthly heart rate irregularities with the significance level is 0.05.       Number of alerts:   Patient's age:     9   85     2   52     3   55     4   68     2   67     5   86     9   83     10   73

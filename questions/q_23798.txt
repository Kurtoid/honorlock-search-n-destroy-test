A girl causes a merry-go-round, which is is initially at rest, to start turning by pulling with a force F=125 N while running on the ground at its edge. She pulls either by grabbing a railing at the edge (a distance R=1.90 m from the center) and pulling sideways, or by grabbing a railing closer the the merry-go-round's center (a distance 3R/4 from the center) and pulling at an angle of th=55deg to the radial direction. Assume the merry-go-round is a uniform solid disk with mass M =165 kg. a) What is the magnitude of the torque applied to the merry-go-round by the girl when she pulls on the outer railing? b) What is the magnitude of the torque applied to the merry-go-round by the girl when she pulls on the inner railing? c) What is the angular acceleration of the merry-go-round when the girl pulls on the inner railing? d) What is the final angular velocity of the merry-go-round after the girl pulls on the inner railing for 4.50 s? e) What is the final angular momentum of the merry-go-round after the girl pulls on the inner railing for 4.50 s?

Identify and fix all the mistakes in the following code snippet that flips a given image ninety degrees towards the right. For example, the following image(|) turns to right () as its output. You cannot add whole new lines of code.                                                                 Input                                                            Output To write your response, mention the line number followed by the incorrect code in the line and then the correct code. For example: Line 2: for ii=1:1:5 should be for ii=2:1:10 (this is just an example!).  clc; clear;  filename = input('Enter the name of the images: ', 's'); pix = imread('filename'); [h,w,c] = size(pix); blank = uint8(zeros(h,w,c));  for ii = 1:1:h     for jj = 1:1:w         newrow = ii;         newcol  =  jj;         pix(newrow, newcol, :) = blank(ii, jj, :);     end end  imshow(blank);

The patient is an 80-year-old male with multiple medical problems: Parkinson's disease, glaucoma, total blindness in the right eye (category 4) and low vision in the left eye (category 1), old MI six months ago, recent abnormal cardiac stress test, status post right total knee replacement, and primary generalized osteoarthrosis.  On this occasion he is admitted to the hospital for a planned revision of his right total knee arthroplasty.  The patient has been evaluated by cardiology and cleared for surgery.  He had been seen by the orthopedic surgeon several weeks ago and scheduled for this revision arthroplasty.  About 10 to 12 years ago the patient had a total knee replacement on the right side for osteoarthritis.  He developed increasing pain in his knee.  The patient was taken to surgery on the day of admission and had a revision right knee arthroplasty of the tibial surface.  The surgeon found femoral and patellar surface components of the previous knee replacement to be stable and in good working order.  The tibial surface component was found to be grossly loose and was able to be removed with little effort.  The tibial tray had divided completely from the cement mantle.  The orthopedic surgeon proceeded to replace it with a new tibial surface component only using cement.  The patient recovered well from surgery without complications and was transferred to a skilled unit facility for rehabilitation and to increase his ability to perform activities of daily living independently.  All of his medical conditions were monitored and treated while he was in the hospital for this surgery.

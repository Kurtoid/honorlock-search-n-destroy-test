A group of researchers found that people prefer training films of moderate length; shorter films contain too little information, while longer films are boring. For a training film on the care of exotic birds, the researchers determined that the ratings people gave for the film could be approximated by     R(t)=20tt2+100{"version":"1.1","math":"R(t)=20tt2+100"},   where t is the length of the film (in minutes), for t>=0{"version":"1.1","math":"t>=0"}. Find the film length that received the highest rating.

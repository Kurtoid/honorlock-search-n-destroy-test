The billboard weighs 8 kip and is supported by a structural tube that has 15 in outer diameter and wall thickness 0.5 in.  If pressure due to wind exerts a resultant force of 3 kip at the center of the billboard, determine the normal and shear stresses at H.  For clarification,  Shear stress at H due to torsion is [tau] psi. Important note:  The origin is located at the base of the tube on the axis, and H is located on the outer surface of the tube, 2 ft above the X axis. For a solid circular cross-section of radius c, the polar moment of inertia is J = pc4/2, and the area moment of inertia is I = pc4/4.

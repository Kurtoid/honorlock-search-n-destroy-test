If the number of cycles of use before failure of a component follows a lognormal distribution with parameters u= 14 and s = 4.6.  What is the probability that the component will fail in less than 1400 cycles?

The answer alone is only worth 1 point.    A quantity of liquid methanol, CH3OH, is introduced into a rigid 3.00-L vessel, the vessel is sealed, and the temperature is raised to 500K.  At this temperature, the methanol vaporizes and decomposes according to the reaction:         CH3OH(g) -  CO(g) + 2 H2(g),             Kc= 6.90 x 10-2 If the concentration of H2 in the equilibrium mixture is 0.426M, what mass of methanol was initially introduced into the vessel?

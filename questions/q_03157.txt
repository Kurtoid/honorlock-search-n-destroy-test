A business letter differs from a memo in that
On January 1, 2048, Sherlock Company acquired 80% of Watson Company's ownership for $140,000 cash. At that date, the fair value of the noncontrolling interest was $35,000. The book value of Watson's net assets at acquisition was $125,000. The book values and fair values of Watson's assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition were equal, except for the following: (1) buildings and equipment were worth $25,000 more than book value, (2) land was worth $5,000 less than book value, and (3) inventory was worth $10,000 more than book value. Buildings and equipment are depreciated on an 8-year basis. The inventory was sold in 2049. Although goodwill is not amortized, the management of Sherlock concluded at December 31, 2049, that goodwill from its acquisition of Watson shares had been impaired and the correct carrying amount is $2,500 lower than the currently recorded value. Goodwill and goodwill impairment were assigned proportionately to the controlling and noncontrolling shareholders. Assume that Watson's depreciation expense every year since acquisition has been constant at $15,000 per year. The partial consolidation worksheet as of December 31, 2049 is presented below.

Below is the opening paragraph of an excellent paper by a UF faculty member in Physical Therapy: Mark Bishop.  Beneath it is text created by a student developing a research project.    Original Text from Mark Bishop, et al, 2010, Physical Therapy: Approximately one third of adults over 65 years of age fall each year(1). Many older adults have psychological consequences after falling,(1-4) and these consequences may be as disabling as the fall itself (5). A commonly expressed psychological consequence is loss of confidence (6) which may lead to decreased mobility and activity restriction (7). Such reduction in activity results in physical deconditioning (8),social isolation (9) depression (9,10) and reduced quality of life (9,10).     New text created by the student:  Thirty three percent of adults over 65 years old suffer falls, and many develop long term "fear of falling" during exercise that limits their mobility.  Loss of mobility causes depression, physical deconditioning, isolation, and reduced quality of life (Bishop MD et al., 2010).     Which statement is true regarding the problems with this text?

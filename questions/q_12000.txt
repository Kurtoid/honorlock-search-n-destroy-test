Parasitism C. Suppose the researchers conducted an experiment to investigate whether other species of defensive symbionts can protect fruit flies from the nematode parasite (Howardula). In the first experiment, they screened for beneficial symbiotic bacteria by searching for species similar to Spiroplasma bacteria.  They established a large population of fruit flies and exposed them to a nematode parasite. Then they separated the fruit fly individuals into two treatment groups: those without parasite (Howardula) and those with parasite (Howardula). They screened (looked) one of seven species of symbionts (A-G). The results are shown in Table 1 below.  Table 1. Percentage of Fruit Fly Individuals with Different Species of Symbionts         Bacterial Species       Treatment   A   B   C   D   E   F   G     Howardula absent   50   40   80   30   50   95   30     Howardula present   50   90   10   30   75   95   96     C. How many symbiont species had no effect on fruit flies with Howardula parasitism? Explain (what evidence do you have). (4pts)

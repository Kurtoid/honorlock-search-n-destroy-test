It has been an absolute pleasure to be your instructor for this. During the course, I hope you learned some things about me (good and bad). I believe that chemical kinetics is the most important course in chemical engineering and makes a chemical engineer unique (don't tell the transport folks, they may take it badly).  At this point, I hope you have built enough confidence to tackle reactor design and kinetics problem. However, I'd like to ask: When you encounter a reactor design problem, what do you do? A) Run for the hills! B) Some critical thinking, but mostly prayers . C) Follow the process. Write your mole balances, your reaction rates, work out your stoichiometry, sprinkle in some pressure drop, heat it (or cool it down) a bit, and finally maybe even account for your catalyst performance (internal transport, external transport).  D) Build a detective wall!
The physical therapy plan of care calls for you to instruct a patient in the use of NMES for re-education of the anterior tibialis muscle in order to improve ankle dorsiflexion. Which of the following would indicated the most appropriate electrode placement along the muscle fibers?

Which cell within respiratory tract produces mucus?
Suppose that two masses m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"} and m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"} collide. We know that m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"} had a momentum p-1,f{"version":"1.1","math":"p-1,f"} vector  after the collision. We also know that m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"} had momentum vectors p-2,i{"version":"1.1","math":"p-2,i"} and p-2,f{"version":"1.1","math":"p-2,f"} before and after the collision respectively. We do not know what the momentum vector of m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"} was before the collision. Describe the step by step process you would take to PROVE what type of collision this is (your options are elastic, inelastic or completely inelastic). You should describe the steps that you would take and make sure that you explain why a step would rule out or verify a particular type of collision. This should only take about 4 steps/sentences, no more. You can list the steps if you want instead of writing a paragraph.

Motion of a charged particle: A pair of charged conducting plates produces a uniform field of 12,000 N/C, directed to the right, between the plates. The separation of the plates is 40 mm. An electron is projected from plate A, directly toward plate B, with an initial velocity of vo = 2.0 x 107 m/s, as shown in the figure. (e = 1.60 x 10-19 C, e0 = 8.85 x 10-12 C2/N [?] m2, mel = 9.11 x 10-31 kg) The velocity of the electron as it strikes plate B is closest to

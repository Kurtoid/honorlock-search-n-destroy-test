The eigenfunctions for a quantum mechanical operator are always [blank1], which means that when the magnitude of the product of two different eigenfunctions is integrated, the result is zero. They can also be [blank2] if they are multiplied by the appropriate constant; this constant makes the integral of the square magnitude of an eigenfunction equal to one. Finally, the set of eigenfunctions forms a [blank3] set, indicating that any other function can be expressed as a sum over all the eigenfunctions.

Above are images of the 5 major groups of land plants. Each of these groups is a clade (a group of related organisms). You can also fit these groups into larger clades. For example, Angiosperms and Gymnosperms are more closely related to each other than they are to the other 3 groups of plants. Therefore, they form a clade. Often clades are defined by a trait that the ancestor of that clade evolved and is now shared by its extant descendants (i.e. the members of the clade). For example, green plants are defined by their shared ability to photosynthesize - a trait that the ancestor of all green plants evolved. Match each clade below (listed as Group A + Group B, etc.) to the defining trait that the ancestor of that clade evolved.

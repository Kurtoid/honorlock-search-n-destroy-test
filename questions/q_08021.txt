The molecule that functions as the reducing agent (electron donor) in a redox or oxidation-reduction reaction
Turn now from the elastic solid to a mystery fluid whose energy density is proportional to the cube of its temperature: E = b V T^3, b>0. Beginning from the fluid equation of state, dE = T dS - p dV, derive an expression for the derivative of energy with respect to entropy while volume is held constant. Express your answer in terms of b, V and E only.
Before you begin ANY of these test questions, make sure you show the camera you turning your phone off and walking/throwing it across the room.  Do NOT leave the view of the webcam.  I need to see where you placed your phone if you walked it - if you threw it, I do not need to see - I can hear:)  Remember, you are only allowed to have blank scrap paper, something to write with, and your TI30XIIS scientific calculator at your work space.Please be mindful of your remaining time. I MUST receive your upload submission BEFORE your submit your test.Good luck:)

Describe the modal model of memory, and the processes by which (according to this model, anyway), information gets in to long-term memory.  To earn full credit, makes sure you: (1) Label the 3 stages and provide at least one characteristic of each stage (3 pts total) (2) Briefly describe the processes that facilitate information entry into each stage. (3 pts total)

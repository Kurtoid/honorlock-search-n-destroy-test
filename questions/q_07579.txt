The following questions involve uploading images of scratch paper. During a normal exam, you should entirely complete the exam assignment without accessing your phone or other forbidden devices.  After you have turned in your exam, you should enter the corresponding scratch paper assignment, where proctoring should be disabled, at which point you can take pictures of your scratch paper, upload them to your computer, and upload them to this assignment.  If you wish, you may upload the images after completing the exam but before starting the scratch paper assignment. For the sake of completing HW00, which asks you to upload your scratch paper but has proctoring enabled, it is acceptable to take out your phone or otherwise take a picture of and upload your scratch paper in order to complete the assignment.  If you are unable to do this for whatever reason, it is acceptable to ignore these questions for now, but you should make sure that you are prepared to upload your scratch paper before the first exam.

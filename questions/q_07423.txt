A car in an amusement park is launched on a rollercoaster by a gigantic spring as shown in the figure above. The spring constant is 200 kN/m, (1kN/m=1000 N/m) and the initial compression of the spring is 120 cm. The mass of the coaster together with the passengers is 2000 kg. Point B is at the top of a circular loop of radius 10.0 m. When the cart is reaching the top of the loop, its speed is 11.0 m/s. a) (3p) What the initial potential energy of the compressed gigantic spring? Show work!

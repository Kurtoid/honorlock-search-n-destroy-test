Please use the Heparin Protocol to answer the questions. WEIGHT ADJUSTED HEPARIN PROTOCOLLab Orders:  STAT: PT, INR, PTT, CBC  STAT: PTT 6 hours after any Heparin BOLUS or rate adjustment.  PTT every 6 hours until two (2) consecutive PTTs are therapeutic (46 to 70). Then change PTT to every 24 hours.  Stop Heparin infusion if platelet count is less than 100,000 or platelet count drops by 50% pre-Heparin level, and notify healthcare provider.

Stock Portfolio    Stock Symbols Number of Shares Cost per Share   FB 100 132.48   AMZN 10 805.66   AAPL 120 108.50   NFLX 50 143.72   GOOG 20 798.53     Note: a stock symbol (or ticker symbol) is an abbreviation used to uniquely identify a publicly traded stock. For example, FB for Facebook, AMZN for Amazon, AAPL for Apple, NFLX for Netflix, GOOG for Google, as in the first column of Table 1. Requirements:  Write a complete Java program starting from the public class declaration. Declare a method that takes a stock symbol as the argument and returns the latest price of this stock.  Note: You only need to write the declaration of the method. Skip the body of the method (i.e., you can simply omit the body of the method). In your main method, simply assume this method has been implemented and is able to retrieve from online the latest price of the stock symbol given as the argument.   In the main method, do the following (REQUIRED):  i) Create three arrays to store the data in Table 1. ii) Use a loop to calculate the total capital gain of the entire portfolio.  Note: Inside the loop, you need to call the method declared above to retrieve the latest price of each stock listed in Table 1. (Hint: use the return value of the method as pricei in the formula below.)The total capital gain of the portfolio equals the sum of the gain of each stock i, that is,                                iii)   Display the result. The output of your program should look like the following:                                                     Portfolio Gain: $1270.50 Note: Display the $ sign (hint: a regular character) and 2 decimal places.

Think about the role of the aromatic molecule in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. Then select the molecule that would be the slowest (least reactive) in the reaction:
You made it through the multiple choice!  Now, show off how much you've learned on these short answer questions!
Consider the reaction shown:   A (aq) +  2 B (aq)  -->  C (aq) +  D(aq) The following data were obtained at a particular temperature.    Trial [ A ], M [ B ], M Initial rate, M/min   1 0.0400 0.200 0.0809   2 0.0800 0.300 0.971   3 0.0800 0.200 0.647   4 see the next line ?    In Trial 4, 40.0 mL of a 0.500 M solution of A are mixed with 30.0 mL of a 0.260 M solution of B.  Use unrounded answers in the calculation steps.  Report your answer for k using correct sig figs.  You can use decimal format or E format. In decimal form for numbers less than 1, always enter the 0 before the decimal point. You should use E format when the power of ten is +/-4 or larger or to properly show sig figs. To enter scientific notation, use E format with no spaces, i.e. for 1.23x10-4 type 1.23E-4.  You must show your work in the file you upload to receive full credit. You'll be asked to type in your rate law in the next question. Fill in the following blanks with the appropriate answer. The order with respect to A is [A] The order with respect to B is [B] The value of the rate constant using trial 1 is [k] The units for the rate constant k are M[unit1] min[unit2] The rate for Trial 4 should be [rate] M/min

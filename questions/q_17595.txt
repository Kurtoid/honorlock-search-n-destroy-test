Competitive Markets  Consider a village's competitive market for rice. The daily market demand for rice (in bushels per day) is given by the equation: Q = 9 -  1/2 P or (equivalently) P = 18 - 2Q The market supply of rice is given by the equation: Q = P - 3 or (equivalently) P = 3 + Q These equations are plotted below (with some labels missing that you will be asked to fill in):  Given this information, answer the following:   (4 pts.) Using the equations for demand and supply given in the instructions above, find the value of the intercepts A, B, and C given in the figure above. (4 pts.) What is price and quantity of rice in competitive equilibrium? (In other words, find P* and Q*.) Why is this equilibrium a Nash equilibrium? (4 pts.) Is the competitive equilibrium efficient? Why or why not? (4 pts.) Calculate producer and consumer surplus in equilibrium. (4 pts.) Suppose now that supply increases to Q = P - 2 or equivalently P = 2 + Q. Recalculate consumer surplus given the new supply. (HINT: Intercept B has changed.) Has consumer surplus increased or decreased?

A 20-kg box is placed on a ramp that has an incline 30 degrees from horizontal. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the mass and the incline surface, uk = 0.400. The coefficient of static friction, us 0.500. a. Determine if the box will move. [Enter your justification in the box below, explaining your answer and referencing the relevant calculations. Write out your calculations on paper. Upload your supporting work right after the exam.] b.  If it does not move, find the force of static friction acting on the box. If it does move, determine the acceleration of the box.  [Type your answer, with units, below.  Upload your supporting work right after the exam]

A heavy truck (mheavytruck=100,000kg) is going up a ramp with 40o of inclination. Due to the weight of the truck with its cargo, the truck is being assisted by a towing truck (mtowtruck=20,000kg), which is connected to the heavy truck by a long and strong rope with elastic constant k=100,000 N/m. Knowing that the heavy truck is exerting a 1.60 x 106 N force on the road and that the acceleration of the truck is a=0.5 m/s2, by how much the rope is being extended? Assume that the truck is moving and that the kinetic friction coefficient is

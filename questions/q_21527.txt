I understand the dress code required for program courses: Clothing  Scrubs or Business Casual must be worn by all students while participating in MLT program courses (any course that begins with 10-513) Shoes: Closed toe shoes must be worn. Lab Coat:  A disposable lab coat must be purchased at the NTC Bookstore and worn for all lab sessions.  Typically, one lab coat will last an entire semester.  However, if the lab coat becomes visibly contaminated with blood or body fluids, or torn, the lab coat must be disposed of and the student must obtain a new lab coat. Hats:  Nothing shall be worn on the head (baseball caps, scarves, etc) unless it is of a required religious nature.  If the head covering falls below the shoulders it must be tucked securely inside the lab coat to prevent contamination by blood and/or body fluids.  Hair  Hair that is shoulder length or longer must be worn up or securely tied back.  Jewelry  Rings may be worn at the wearer's risk.  Rings with stones have the potential to make small holes in gloves. A wristwatch and small earrings may be worn. No other body piercing jewelry is allowed.  Hygiene  Freshly showered/bathed Use deodorant/antiperspirant Fingernails must be clean and well trimmed (less than  1/4 "). No artificial nails allowed. Perfumes, colognes, or other scents (such as from cigarette smoke) are not allowed.

A teratoma is a tumor composed of several different types of tissue that can include muscle, teeth, hair, or bone. Teratomas develop from germ cells, a type of cell that gives rise to gametes. Because germ cells are not differentiated into specific cell types (as are e.g. muscle cells, skin cells, fat cells, etc.), teratomas can develop exhibiting numerous different cell types, giving them their name teratoma, Greek for "monstrous tumor". Teratomas may be benign or cancerous. As a result of mistakes in processes of cell division, they are generally diploid, and sometimes polyploid. Consider a cell of a teratoma and a healthy human epithelial (skin) cell. Now consider the DNA and the three types of RNA (mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA) found in both. For each of these (DNA, mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA), compare what you would expect to find in both a teratoma and a healthy cell. Would they be the same, or different, or both? Please explain briefly but clearly for each of these four nucleic acids and provide examples or reasons. 1) DNA 2) mRNA 3) tRNA 4) rRNA  Photo credits: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/281850-overview (left) and Ed Uthman, MD. http://web2.airmail.net/uthman/specimens/index.html (right)

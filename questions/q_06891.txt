If you want to correct ONE question, you can do so here.  Type in the question # (if you're not sure of the number, take your best guess and describe what the problem was about so I can tell) Type in your corrected answer here. Be careful! Don't second guess and convert a correct answer to an incorrect one. If it's a calculation problem, show your new work in the file you upload. No work, no credit for the new answer. Do NOT erase the old work that supported your original answer. Show the new work separate from the old work, or cross out with a single line cross-out so that I can still see the original work. Sorry, only ONE question can be corrected. If you give me more than one corrected question, I'll credit only the first one. If you have no corrections, you may type "NA" in the space provided, so the exam recognizes that you answered the question.

Neanderthal fossil bones often show signs of severe injury. The ________stone tools made by Neanderthal could only be used on a thrusting spear which meant that killing large animals required dangerously close contact. DNA sequenced from a finger bone found at ________ Cave in Siberia shows that a species of hominin genetically different from both Neanderthal and modern humans lived at the cave 38,000 years ago. Comparison with the genes of modern human populations shows that both Tibetans and the modern inhabitants of New Guinea have a small percentage of genes from this species known only from its genome (plus the finger bone and one tooth).  While Neanderthal hunted big game in Europe under arctic conditions, the ancestors of modern humans emerged in ____________ with a diet that included shellfish and a wide range of resources. Versatility of diet is a marker of our species.  __________proposed that the evolution of varied human skin coloration reflects the dual selective pressures of (1) the need for adequate Vitamin D synthesis and (2) the need to prevent folate destruction by excess solar radiation (on skin not protected by fur). Behaviors shared by humans and chimpanzees (such as tool-making and hunting) suggest that such behaviors were likely present in the ________of humans and chimpanzees (who lived about 6 million years ago). Known as the "father of American anthropology," ________ believed that cultures cannot be ranked as higher or lower. He taught his students that all humans see the world through the lens of their own culture.  He believed that it is the job of the anthropologist to record the variety of ways humans in distinctive cultural groups perceive and interact with their world through that cultural lens.  Chimpanzees at Gombe Stream, Tanzania harvest ants by fishing in ant colonies using sticks modified for the purpose. Chimpanzees at Kibale, Uganda never engage in this behavior.  In a 1999 Nature article, chimpanzee researchers from 7 different study sites cited this as one of 39 behaviors that indicate that chimpanzees show evidence of _______ behavior. Compared to chimpanzees, human cultures have more evidence of _______. The rate of change of human cultures can be fast or slow but cumulative change over time has not been documented for chimpanzees.  As demonstrated in the video "Trobriand Cricket," human cultural behavior affects many domains of behavior not seen in chimpanzees. This includes highly coordinated group behavior like chanting and dance, body decoration and the use of _______ in an attempt to influence outcomes.  The shaman uses ______ to influence the weather for the day of the cricket match.  When comparing food acquisition by chimpanzees with food acquisition by human foraging groups, Kaplan and associates found that modern human foragers focus on _________foods which must be extracted or hunted while chimpanzees get most of their calories from collected food like fruit and leaves.  The analysis of Neanderthal DNA has shown that Neanderthals had the gene for _____.  It has also shown us that Neanderthal was a cousin (not an ancestor) of modern humans and that the last common ancestor of Neanderthal and modern humans lived more than 500,000 years ago.

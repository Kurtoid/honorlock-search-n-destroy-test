Alcohol abuse researchers wanted to determine if the number of alcoholic drinks per week drunk by a successful college student had any impact on his/her studies (and in particular, on his/her GPA).  Sixty graduating seniors were selected at random and asked what their GPA was and how many drinks they had, per week, throughout their college career.  Here are the results of the analysis of the least squares regression line for this data:      The regression equation is:                                           GPA = 3.45140 - 0.0592606 DRINKS                                                                                S = 0.386810      R2 = 31.8 %      R2 (adj) = 30.6 %  How would we interpret R2 for this equation?     31.8% of the variability in GPA is explained by the number of drinks per week. 31.8% of the variability in the number of drinks per week is explained by GPA. 31.8% of the variability in GPA cannot be explained. It is inappropriate to interpret R2 for this equation, since it is so small.

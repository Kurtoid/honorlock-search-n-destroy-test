You are working in a factory that produces metal wires that are long cylinders in shape. You are attempting to optimize the amount of metal used in the manufacturing process. A typical wire is 1000 mm long and has a radius of 1 mm. However, the manufacturing process has some variance. After some data collection, you believe the maximum error in the length of the wires is 0.5 mm, and the maximum error in the radius is 0.01 mm. a) Use a differential to estimate the maximum error in the volume of the wire. b) Your coworker states that the variance in the length is more important than the variance in the radius because 0.5 is much bigger than 0.01. Respond to your coworker's claim.

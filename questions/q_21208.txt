Instead, we decided to go somewhere different, so we chose Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. We stayed at the Burj Al Arab hotel: "The Best Hotel in the Middle East." There are nine restaurants in the hotel, but we didn't eat in all of them.During our trip, we went to the Burj Khalifa, one of the tallest buildings in the world. We took an elevator to the observation deck. It was a little scary to be so high up, but the view from the 124th floor was amazing! We could see the city, the desert, and the ocean!And of course, the shopping was fantastic--we bought some nice clothes. There are many modern shopping malls in Dubai, but I liked the old markets the best because I liked the traditional shops and buildings. We bought lots of souvenirs there. We also rented a car and went to the desert. It was really beautiful, and we took hundreds of photos. It was an excellent vacation.

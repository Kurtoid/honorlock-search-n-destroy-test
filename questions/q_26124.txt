The Federalist Era by Jim Miller described
Use the following scenario for the next 4 questions (Questions 11, 12, 13, and 14): Many rocks contain trace amounts of uranium.  A scientist notices that the radioactive element uranium (U) loses its toxicity when incubated in soil for several weeks. He wonders, "How is the soil detoxifying the uranium?" After several days in the university library, he uncovers a report that describes a soil bacterium that can detoxify uranium. He reasons that the native soil bacteria might be responsible for detoxifying the uranium. After splitting a soil sample into six equal portions, he sterilizes 3 portions using high heat and pressure (i.e., kills all bacteria in the sample), and the other 3 he leaves intact (normal live bacteria). Then he adds uranium to all samples and measures the toxicity of the uranium over the next several weeks. To his surprise, uranium from both the sterilized and the intact soil diminish in toxicity.   Assume that the scientist can accurately measure the radioactivity of the uranium.  Would you expect that all 3 control samples would have the exact same uranium radioactivity following the experiment?  Why or why not (1 sentence).

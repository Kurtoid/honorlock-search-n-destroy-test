Use your own materials to do the following: For this practical, you will use an ATxmega128A1U microcontroller to create continuously running asynchronous serial (SCI) to synchronous serial (SPI) converter, as well as output a voltage based on the serial value. For the entirety of this problem, use the default system clock of 2 MHz. No backpacks are needed for this assignment.  Use the appropriate USART on your uPAD with a baud rate of 37 kHz, eight data bits, even parity, and one stop bit. Each time a character is received, immediately transmit that character using SPI. You must use appropriate group configurations, bit positions, and/or bit masks and not use numbers. Use the appropriate SPI on your uPAD such that [1] a serial clock frequency 62.5 kHz is utilized (remember that the system clock frequency is 2 MHz), [2] data transmitted will be arranged in a least significant bit first ordering, [3] (except for the first bit) transmission of bits will occur on a rising edge of the serial clock (the opposite edge of when data is sampled), [4] the default value of the serial clock, when not in use, will be zero (low). In order to use your DAD, connect Select (in Figure 1b and 1c) to high (3.3 V). If the received with the USART and transmitted value is 64 = 0x40 or less, output 1 V on the DAC; if it is higher, output 2 V on the DAC. For testing purposes, note that numbers will result in values less than 64 and letters will result in values greater than 64. Continue to hold the DAC output value until another character is received. Prior to demonstration, you must zip your entire project (including all utilized files) and then upload the zip file to the Canvas Quiz. If you have not demonstrated prior to 5 minutes before the end of your exam time, you must stop at that point and start the zip and upload process, and complete this process before your time expires. Failure to upload your project's zip file before then will result in a grade of zero.  Demonstrate the following to a PI or Dr. Schwartz:  Use PuTTY to allow characters typed on your computer keyboard to be received by your uPAD. Show that the byte has been received (with a breakpoint and Watch debug window or by transmitting the received data back to your PC monitor through PuTTY). Before you connect with PuTTY, show the PI your settings. [25%] Use your DAD (as you did in Lab 6) to show that the SPI system has transmitted the data as specified. View all appropriate SPI signals with the SPI digital bus analyzer function of the Logic program within the Waveforms software (see the left image of Figure 1). [25%]  Suggestion: Set a trigger on the appropriate edge of the clock signal. Remember that the clock is low when idle and that the transmission of bits will occur on the clock's rising edge.   Combine the above two items to create the SCI to SPI converter. [25%] Use the Scope function within the Waveforms software to display the value generated with the DAC. If the received serial value is 64 = 0x40 or less, output 1 V on the DAC; if it is higher, output 2 V on the DAC. For testing purposes, note that numbers (0 through 9) will result in values less than 64 and both lower and upper case letters will result in values greater than 64. [25%]  Prior to demonstration, you must zip your entire project (including all utilized files) and then upload the zip file to the Canvas Quiz. If you have not demonstrated prior to 5 minutes before the end of your exam time, you must stop at that point and start the zip and upload process, and complete this process before your time expires. Failure to upload your project's zip file before then will result in a grade of zero.   Figure 1: a) Adding an SPI bus within the Logic program; b) necessary SPI settings; c) set the appropriate Clock trigger (column T); d) Clock trigger choices.   When you are finished or five minutes before the end of this practical (whichever comes first), you must zip your Atmel Studio project. Failure to upload your zip file (BELOW) before the end of the practical will result in a grade of zero.    After submitting the assignment, close Honorlock, but do NOT close Zoom. Immediately turn on your camera and share your screen in Zoom. (If you close Zoom before your demo, you will earn a zero on the practical.) Look for the "?" in Zoom, with the label "Ask for Help"; select this to indicate that you are ready for your demo. During a demonstration, you must download and utilize the submitted zip file, and follow the PI's instructions.

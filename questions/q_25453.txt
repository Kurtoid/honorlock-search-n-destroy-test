I found a book which I loved very much, for it took me out of my state of dismay and desolation. . . . for Philosophy, about whom Boethius had learned in his studies, did not despise him because of his exile, or his troubles, or his misfortunes; rather, she came to comfort him; and spoke to him so much that she demonstrated to him through logic that earthly happiness is nothing but transitory joy. . . ."  c) "And in this great affliction and misery of our city the reverend authority of the laws, both divine and human, had fallen and almost completely disappeared, for, like other men, the ministers and executors of the laws were either dead or sick or so short of help that it was impossible for them to fulfill their duties; as a result, everybody was free to do as he pleased."

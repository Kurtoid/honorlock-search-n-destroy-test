Case Report - Event Reporting: A Nurse was taking care of a patient that was ordered midodrine for orthostatic hypotension. After checking the ADM to remove for administration, he realized the medication wasn't available from the ADM. He then sent a medication message to the Pharmacy in the EHR, requesting the missing dose. Pharmacy sent up the missing medication in a plastic bag with an Epic medication label and barcode affixed to the outside of the bag. The RN went to the bedside and scanned the patient's armband, then scanned the medication specific barcode to administer. A "Wrong Medication" alert kept popping on the screen, which didn't allow the RN to document the administration for the medication. To work around this alert, the RN decided to try scanning the Epic medication label barcode, and that worked without any errors. Before administering the medication to the patient, the RN checked the medication, and realized it was minoxidil and NOT midodrine. The RN did not administer the medication, and instead ended up sending the dose back to receive the correct product to administer to the patient.

A drug company tested three formulations of a pain relief medicine for migraine headache sufferers. For the experiment 27 volunteers were selected and 9 were randomly assigned to one of three drug formulations. The subjects were instructed to take the drug during their next migraine headache episode and to report their pain on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being most pain).  The scores were recorded and an ANOVA was performed to determine whether or not significant differences exist among the mean scores for the three groups.  Assume a = 0.01.  The partially completed ANOVA Table is located below.      SS   df   MS   F     Treatment   28.22    14.11         Error                  Total   56.66   26                Complete the table above. (Use the insert table function to do so) What would be the null hypothesis in this study? (you must enter the parameters or no credit will be given for the hypotheses -- you can use the equation editor to insert symbols/Greek letter) What would be the alternate hypothesis? What is your Fcrit? What is the decision rule? Is there a significant difference between the groups? Why or why not?  Explain and/or Show your work.

Superoxide radicals are formed during the incomplete reduction of O2 during the electron transport in aerobes and during the metabolism by anaerobes in the presence of oxygen. There are three enzymes in the detoxifying process. The enzyme that catalyzes Reaction A is [super_oxide_dismutase]; Reaction B is catalyzed by [peroxidase]; and Reaction C is catalyzed by [catalase].

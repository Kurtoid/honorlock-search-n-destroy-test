Scenario for questions 19 through 23:  You are studying the metabolism of two novel organisms, Hilltopper goati and Texococcus austinii.  You discover that they are both chemoorganoheterotrophs that grow anaerobically.  They also both have an electron transport chain containing protein complexes very similar to those found in Parococcus.  However, they use different molecules as a terminal electron acceptor.  H. goati uses Chemical H and T. austinii uses Chemical T.  The table below contains the reduction potential of all of the complexes found in Parococcus, as well as the two terminal electron acceptors Chemical H and Chemical T.    Molecule/Complex Reduction potential (V)   NADH -0.32   FADH2  -0.22   Complex I -0.30   Complex II +0.03   Q cycle +0.05   Complex III +0.10   Cytochrome C +0.22   Complex IV +0.55   Chemical H +0.15   Chemical T +0.04

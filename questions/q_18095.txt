The mother of a 3-year-old child takes the child to a play group once a week. She expresses concern that the child plays with toys but does not interact with the other toddlers. What will the primary care pediatric nurse practitioner counsel the mother? Correct Answer: Toddlers may be interested in other children but usually do not engage in interactive play. Parallel play is common among toddlers who, although they may be fascinated by other children, generally do not engage with peers in an interactive manner. This does not mean that the child is shy or has a language delay, although in preschool years, the development of symbolic language increases interactive play. Children need both structured and free play, but structured play will not increase interaction during this normally parallel period.

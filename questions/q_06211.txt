There are two ways to build a model using keras that are discussed in the text and in class. The first is to build a model by adding the layers one at a time. As in the first code chunk below. The second way is to create and pass a list of layers when creating model. I've started it in the second code chunk below. Fill in the drop downs with the right code. It may help if you get lost to write it out in your notebook or colab.  model = keras.models.Sequential()model.add(keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=[28, 28]))model.add(keras.layers.Dense(300, activation="relu"))model.add(keras.layers.Dense(100, activation="relu"))model.add(keras.layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax"))model = keras.models.Sequential([   #LAYER 1? #LAYER 2?   #LAYER 3? #LAYER 4?])Layer 1 should read: [layer_1]Layer 2 should read: [layer_2]Layer 3 should read: [layer_3]layer 4 should read: [layer_4]

I understand that I need the following in order to correctly take and submit an exam so that it won't be "Flagged" by Honorlock.   -reliable internet access - a webcamera and a microphone - a thorough and adequate scan of the room to clearly indicate that there are no other resources (computer, book, notebook, etc.)  in the room - a quiet space so that extraneous noise will not "flag" my exam as having a problem   - a flat surface on which to place my computer so that excessive movement will not "flag" my exam -a background free of photos, drawings, and images of faces   I also understand that moving my face out of the webcam frame can "flag" my exam, causing the program to alert the professor of a possible breach of conduct.

Read the following article and answer the questions that follow. While everyone begins life without a notion of what is right and wrong, we all acquire a moral sense as we age. From this assumption, U.S. psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg (1927-1979) developed a theory that asserted that our development of a moral sense progresses through six recognizable stages, which can be subsumed under three levels. The first level is called the pre-conventional level and is assumed to be where all humans begin at birth. At this level, right is what results in pleasure, and wrong is whatever causes discomfort and unhappiness. Most people gradually develop to a second level in moral reasoning, called the conventional level. Kohlberg said that right and wrong at the conventional level of moral reasoning is primarily defined in terms of authority figures, be they parents, political leaders, or God. Kohlberg theorized that the highest level of moral reasoning is what he termed the post-conventional level. Those who reason about moral issues at this level do so primarily in terms of universal principles of equity and justice. In other words, neither pleasure/pain nor rules set forth by those in authority guide moral decision-making at the post-conventional level. Instead, an individual's own internalized sense of right and wrong emerges based on universal principles of the equal worth of human life.

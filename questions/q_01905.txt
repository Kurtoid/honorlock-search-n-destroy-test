The figure below shows a three-bit shift register made up of flip-flops.  These are modified TTL flip-flops, which respond to an open input as if it were a logic LOW.  Initially, all of the FFs are in the LOW state before the clock pulses are applied.  Suppose the actual output of this shift register is as shown below.     A.)  At what clock pulse does an error occur? Explain how you identified the error. B.) What is a possible circuit fault can produce this operation? Explain your reasoning.

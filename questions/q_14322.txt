The following sample of bivariate (x, y) data concerning the speed of a car (in miles per hour; MPH) and the corresponding fuel economy (in miles per gallon; MPG).  Use this data to answer the following:     Speed (MPH)   30   40   50   60   70     Fuel Economy (MPG)   31   31   33   32   27        Calculate the correlation coefficient (r) and the line of best fit () for the given data set. What is the best predicted fuel economy (MPG) for the given speed of 55 miles per hour? Show all work to receive credit and provide your reasoning. Based on the sample data, is it appropriate to predict the fuel economy (MPG) for a given speed of 20 miles per hour? Explain your reasoning.

Lecture Test 3, Question 2 Match the population growth model with the correct formula.  The left had side of the formula equation (left of the equal sign) has been omitted.  One formula is not used. Nt + rdNt(1-Nt/K) =  rN =  rN(1-N/K) =
4. Decision Trees (12 points)  We have used a greedy one-step lookahead for growing decision trees: we pick a new node to add by looking at the remaining attributes and choosing the one with the greatest information gain. Let's call Gain(a,d) the information gain function, where a is an attribute and d our data set. Imagine that we instead used a two-step lookahead. Rather than pick a single node to add to our tree we are allowed to choose a node and its children simultaneously. We define a new information gain measure, Gain2(a,l,r,d), that computes the information gain of the attribute combined with the information gain of the best children that could follow it. In other words, we find a, l, and r that maximize Gain2(a,l,r,d) = Gain(a,d) + Gain(l,pos(d,a)) + Gain(r,neg(d,a)). Here pos(d,a) and neg(d,a) return the subset of data in d where attribute a is positive and negative, respectively, and Gain2 is reasonably defined when a, l, r and/or d are empty. This defines a mini tree (much like class Hs2 except that the children of a maybe different) that we then add to our decision tree. (a) Is this a richer hypothesis class? Why or why not? (b) What are some advantages and disadvantages of this alternate approach? Clearly mark your answers with (a) and (b).
2.  The next two questions have to do with the structural model. a.    In the literature, there is very little consensus on the cut-off values in evaluating model fit indexes in SEM. Using the fit indexes of the structural model on the following page, evaluate the adequacy of the model. Please make sure you provide citations to support your argument. (10 points) b.    There are numerous fit indexes in SEM. Would you use Chi-square statistic in evaluating the structural model? Please explain why or why not. In addition, what other fit indexes would you use? Please select four fit indexes you would not use and four fit indexes you prefer to use, and justify your discussion with citations. (10 points)

T(n) for 6 algorithms B1-B6 are given below. Rank order these algorithms. B1: T(n)=lg2n +10 B2: T(n)=25(logn to the base 8)3+100 B3: T(n)=5n-3n B4: T(n)=40n5+300n2+20n+1 B5: T(n)=n!-4n3+5 B6: T(n)=2nn-1000n Use the labels of algorithms (i.e., B1, B2) for filling the blank lines. The first blank line is for the most efficient algorithm, and the last blank in the second row is for the least efficient one. Your rank ordering from most efficient to least efficient: [b1] < [b2] < [b4] < [b3] < [b5] < [b6]

Considering the below chart, label the three trends of device failure rate based on the following descriptions: PCB - A printed circuit board suffers a brief wear in period followed by an extended period with a relatively constant failure rate as well as some wear out near the end of "life" due to environmental exposure SOFTWARE - A software program does not suffer wear out and use does not substantial contribute to failure rate; however, most failures occur due to "bugs" built-in to the software at the start of life PUMP - A mechanical pump is sold by a manufacturer that conducts burn-in tests at the factory before delivery to customers; however, failure mechanisms for the pump include part fatigue and corrosion (draw the failure rate from the customer's perspective)    Curve "a" = [Curve_a] Curve "b" = [Curve_b] Curve "c" = [Curve_c]

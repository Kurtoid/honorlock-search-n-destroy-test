You're an inventive Java developer and you decided to build a program that will keep track of your startup company ideas.  Three properties that make up a startup idea are: (a) the problem that the idea is solving; (b) the number of people who experience the problem; (c) whether there are existing solutions to the problem.  To illustrate, let's consider Google.  When the company first started the following were true: (a) finding information on the web was quite hard; (b) 200 million people were on the web; (c) there were solutions, which were poor however. Write a class called StartupIdea that has three instance variables that represent the (a), (b), and (c) properties described above.  The types and names for these instance variables are: (a)    String : problem (b)    int : marketSize (c)     boolean : existingSolutions So, in Google's case the values represented by (a), (b), and (c) would be: (a) "finding information on the web is quite hard" (b) 200000000 (c)  true   In addition to these instance variables, StartupIdea should also include: 1)      a constructor that accepts values for each of these variables and uses shadowing to assign them.  2)      a variable called totalIdeas that keeps track of the number of total StartupIdeas created during a program's run.  Use the most restrictive visibility for this variable and the three instance variables listed above. 3)      a public setter and getter method for marketSize 4)      a toString method that prints out the values of each instance variable in a clearly labeled way. 5)      a parameterless instance method called scrap with two statements.  The first prints out a line of text that contains "Scrapping: " followed by the problem value. The second decrements the value of totalIdeas.   6) a main method that creates a single StartupIdea object with the following values for problem, marketSize, and existingSolutions: "finding hand-sanitizer is nearly impossible", 300000000, and true. 7) The main method then invokes the scrap method on the above object after it's created.  The expect output for that would be: Scrapping: finding hand-sanitizer is nearly impossible

[15 points] A freeway section has the capacity of 6000 vph. The demand is 4000 vph initially and increases to 8000 vph at 7AM and decreases back to 4000 vph at 9AM. On a particular day, an incident occurs at 8AM and restricts the flow to 2000 vph. The incident is partially cleared one hour later, which improves the flow to 4000 vph. The incidents is completely cleared at 10AM. (a) [5 points] Draw queueing diagrams (on the same graph) depicting the onset and clearance of queue on a day without an incident and on the day of incident. (b) [5 points] What is the maximum queue length on the day of incident?  (c) [5 points] What is the additional total delay incurred on the day of incident (compared to a day without incident)?

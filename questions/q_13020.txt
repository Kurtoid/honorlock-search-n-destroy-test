6. (10 points, 5 minutes) (Program discontinuity and Pipelining) Consider the following instruction sequence: I1: currently in the WB stageI2: currently in the MEM stageI3: currently in the EX stageI4: currently in the ID/RR stageI5: currently in the IF stage   I4 is an add instruction, which when it gets into the EX stage will cause an arithmetic overflow.  The arithmetic exception will be registered in the ETR (exception/trap register) with the unique number 42. The entry in the IVT (interrupt vector table) for 42 is 1000. Assume that the ETR and IVT are available to the IF stage of the pipeline to retrieve the starting address of the exception handler.    List the steps that will be taken by the pipelined processor which will ultimately result in the instructions corresponding to the exception handler entering the pipeline.

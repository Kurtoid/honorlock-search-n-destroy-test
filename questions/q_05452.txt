Skrillex Company manufactures computer circuit cards and uses a process costing system.   All direct materials are added at the beginning of the production process and there are no conversion costs.   For November, there was no beginning WIP, 8,000 cards were started, 7,000 cards were completed, 350 cards were spoiled as expected (normal), and ending WIP of 650 cards were 100% complete with respect to direct material costs.   Spoilage is detected when the production process is 100% complete.   Direct material costs added to production during November totaled $100,000. What is the total production cost (in dollars) assigned to 'normal spoilage' for November? You may use either the weighted-average or FIFO method to determine your response.  Round interim and final dollar amounts to two (2) decimal places (e.g., $107.6457 would be $107.65).
Ashoka Tan is fighting Darth Maul using a new weapon which comprises two massless rods connected at a right angle.  There are three equal point masses of mass M kg attached to the rods; two of the masses are at either end of the rods.  The third is located on one of the rods some distance d meters away from the connection point.  If the length of each rod is R meters and the moment of inertia of the entire weapon is I, what is the value of d?

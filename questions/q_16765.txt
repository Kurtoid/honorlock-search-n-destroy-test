Given the series of reactions with known changes of enthalpy: A + [c1]B - [c2]C +[c3]D                DH1 = [dh1] kJ/mol             B - G                                   DH2 = [dh2] kJ/mol             A - [c3]D + E                      DH3 = [dh3] kJ/mol   Figure out change of enthalpy (DH) of the reaction: [c1]G + E - [c2]C Write your answer in kJ/mol rounding up to 0 decimal places.

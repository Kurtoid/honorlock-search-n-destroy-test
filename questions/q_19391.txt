Passage 3: Natural GasUse the following passage to answer questions 37 to 44Natural gas is a vital component of the world's supply of energy. It is known to be one of the safest, most environmentally friendly, and useful energy sources known to man. Despite its importance there are many misconceptions associated with natural gas. Many of these misconceptions are due to variety of uses of the word 'gas'. For example, we use gas to fuel our car and motorcycles, and we barbeque on gas grills. These 'gases' however, are not natural gas. They are other substance of gas such as fossil and propane.Natural gas is nothing new. In fact, most of the natural gas that is found today in reservior underneath the earth was manufactured millions and millions of years ago.  There are many different theories as to its origin. The most widely accepted theory suggests that natural gas is formed when organic matter (such as the remians of plants and animals) is compressed under the earth's surface at a very high pressure for a very long time. Natural gas can also be formed when specific micro-organisms chemically break down organic matter. A third way in which natural gas can be produced is called the abiogenic process. Tis formation of natural gas is the result of an underground interaction between organic matter, gases, and minerals in a high pressure environment.Due to its methods of production, natural gas is usually found underneath the surface of the earth. Once it is formed, it will rise toward the surface of the earth through loose, shale type rock and other materials. Some of the gas will simply rise to the surface and dissipate into air. A great deal of this gas, however, will be "trapped"under the ground and accumulate there. This happens when a rock named 'impermeable sedimentary' forms a 'dome' shape like an umbrella that catches all the natural gas that is floating to the surface. With natural gas trapped under the earth in this fashion, it can be recovered by drilling a hole through the rock.  The gas that is under great pressure then flows to the surface, where it is collected.Most of the natural gas resreves are located in the Middle East (34%  of the world's total) and Europe and the former USSR (42% of the world's total reserves). The United States possessess 3 percent of the world's total natural gas reserves. Most of the gas found in the United States is concentrated in relatively distinct geographical areas. Gas can mostly be found around Texas and the Gulf of MexicoWhere are most of the natural gas reserviors in the world located?

Landon contributed $500,000 to an irrevocable trust and did not retain any right to the trust's assets. The income beneficiary of the irrevocable trust was Landon's sister, and the remainder beneficiary of the irrevocable trust was Landon's niece. At the time of the transfer, Landon paid gift tax of $35,000. Landon died four years later, when the value of the irrevocable trust was $1,200,000. With regard to the irrevocable trust, how much is included in Landon's gross estate?
A patient with heart failure presents to your practice complaining of classic symptoms of his disease. On examination, numerous murmurs are noted throughout the chest. In addition to a 12-lead ECG, what is the next diagnostic study to order that would be most helpful to identify the severity of the patient's problems?
In the third part of the soda ash titration, you must first boil the solution to break down the phosphoric acid.
On auscultation, which finding suggests a right pneumothorax?

What would the new intensity be if the original intensity was 10 Coulombs/kg at a distance of 180 cm if the distance changed to 40 inches?
Your patient presents with pain in the left medial knee joint that worsens walking long distances and ascending and descending stairs. The pain decreases with rest and ibuprofen. Drawer sign is negative, and varus and valgus stress test indicates LCL laxity. The prescription is for a left knee orthosis. What would you recommend for this patient?
If the temperature profile consists of below-freezing temperatures aloft, followed by a thick warmer layer, and a thin layer of below-freezing temperatures at the surface, then what type of precipitation may arise?

Forward recovery is faster than restore/rerun because:
In a neurophysiology lab, a collection of axons (a nerve fiber) is placed in a chamber and an electrical stimulator is used to drive their membranes to threshold.  Recording electrodes record the arrival of the action potentials at the end of the axons.  As the frequency of the firing of the electrical stimulator increased, the frequency of the action potentials generated also increased, to a point.  After that point, the frequency of action potentials generated remained constant, despite a continued increase in stimulator frequency.  (10 points) - Explain the specific mechanism causing the "plateau" in action potential frequency. (5 points) - Explain why the recordings of the action potentials yielded different velocities of action potentials along the nerve fiber.  Additionally, the recording of the arrival of action potentials
The health care provider at a long-term care facility encourages the older adults to drink even though they may not feel thirsty at the time. Which statement supports the health care provider's action?

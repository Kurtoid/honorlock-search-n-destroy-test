Reprinted below is the text of a poem we did not read in class.  "Leda and the Swan" is William Butler Yeats's poem which tells the mythological story of Leda who refused the romantic advances of the god Zeus.  Determined to have Leda, Zeus transformed himself into a swan so that Leda would allow him to come near, then he raped her.  Leda gave birth to an egg from which were born two sets of twins:  Castor and Pollux, boys who grew up to live immortally as the constellation Gemini, the twins; and Helen and her sister Clytemnestra.  Helen grew up to become the woman whose beauty made her so irresistible that the Trojan War was fought to recover her from her lover; Clytemnestra married Agamemnon, the king whose death is mentioned in line 11 of the poem.

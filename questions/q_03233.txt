A 2014-T6 aluminum alloy is subjected to a repeated tension-compression load cycling along its axis.  The S-N curves are provided below.  Two lines represent the experiments that were done at two different mean stress, sm. The stress plotted on the vertical axis is stress amplitude (samplitude).  The tensile strength of this alloy is 400MPa.  For aluminum alloy, the fatigue limit is usually defined as the stress amplitude at N = 108.         a) (5 pts) Explain the Goodman Relationship, including the meaning of each variable. b) (5 pts) If the Goodman relationship is valid for this Al alloy, compute the mean stress, sm, of the bottom curve. c) (5 pts) Calculate the maximum and minimum stress that is applied in the experiment of the bottom curve at the fatigue life of 1.0x106 d) (5 pts) Under the testing condition of the bottom curve, the sample was first tested at 300 MPa for 5X103 cycles, and then at 200 MPa for 105 cycles, how many cycles can the sample last before failure when later it is further tested at 150 MPa.

8.  Nadia has been trying to study the reaction below at 25oC without success. It just doesn't want to work, and her P.I. (principal investigator) is getting frustrated with her lack of progress.                                                             NO2(g)  +  N2O(g)  =  3 NO(g)      a) Given that DHo = +155.67 kJ and DSo = +171.41 J/K for this reaction, calculate DGfo for this reaction.  At 25oC, should this reaction be nonspontaneous or spontaneous?  (3 pts)        b) Given that DHo = +155.67 kJ and DSo = +171.41 J/K for this reaction, is it always nonspontaneous, always spontaneous, or spontaneous only at a certain range?  If at a certain range, what range is that, and what can Nadia do to make her research project succeed?  [Assume DHo and DSo don't vary with temperature.]  (3 pts)

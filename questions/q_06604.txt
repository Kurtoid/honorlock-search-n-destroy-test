Several recently published reports and case studies suggest that RFID technology can greatly improve the efficiency of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, monitor the distribution processes and conditions, and minimize the potential errors.   For an example, with respect to monitoring the distribution conditions, here is the quote from a ZDNET interview with Charlie Goetz, CEO of Powercast (a RFID equipment manufacturing company): The RFID-based temperature probe can be powered and read from RFID readers outside the refrigerator without having to run wires to the probe, open the door, worry about communication or battery failure, etc. Powercast RFID technology provides a completely maintenance-free and battery-free sensor tracking solution for RFID applications (such as COVID-19 vaccine monitoring). For another example, with respect to minimizing the potential distribution mistakes, here is the quote from a case study about the Pennsylvania state health department, published in HealthcareITNews: Prior to leveraging RFID, we were unfortunately experiencing incorrect inventory counts at the end of some days, as the vaccines needed to be counted by hand three separate times en route to the patient, leaving too much room for human error. Since we started using RFID to automate our COVID-vaccination workflow, we have had accurate item-level counts to report back to the Pennsylvania Health Department, which ensures we vaccinate as many members of our health system community - and the larger community, as possible. Question A: What dos RFID stand for? Provide explanations on how RFID works. Question B: There are two types of RFID technologies or tags: active tags and passive tags. Which type of RFID tags is the Powercast RFID tags as they are "powered and read from RFID readers outside the refrigerator"?

{3.} The first three key communication dimensions that change in both developing relationships and decaying relations are "from narrow to broad", "from public to personal", "from stylized to unique." In the first changing communication dimension, the dyad is showing an increase in breadth, the range of topics discussed and how much of those topics are revealed. The second changing communication dimension is known as the depth of social interaction. In this second dimension, conversation is becoming more personal as the relationship progresses.

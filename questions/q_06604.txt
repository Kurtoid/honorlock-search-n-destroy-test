Arturo's basis in the T stock is $50,000.  Publix wants to acquire the property for a store site.  Publix is willing to give either voting common stock worth $150,000 in exchange for the property in a taxable exchange or its stock worth $130,000 in exchange for either the property or the stock of T in a transaction that will be tax-free to Arturo and T.

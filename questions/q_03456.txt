During a period of inflation:
Bottleneck time = time of slowest workstation (one that takes longest) after dividing by the number of parallel (redundant) operations in a production system Throughput time = time it takes a unit to go through production from start to end, with no waiting Workstation capacity = inverse of bottleneck time Figure 2.  Assembly Line with Parallel Processes for Salad Express   a) Select the bottleneck time of the entire operation, taking into account the combined assembly line operations with parallel processes for Salad Express in Figure 2. [ParallelBottleneck2] b) Select the workstation capacity of the entire operation, taking into account the combined assembly line operations with parallel processes for Salad Express in Figure 2. [ParallelWorkstationCapacity2] c) Select the throughput time of the assembly line with parallel processes for Salad Express in Figure 2. [ParallelThroughput2]

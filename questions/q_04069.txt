David is a CSR for a shoe company that sells online and through retail outlets located around the country. A customer calls to complain about a retail outlet refusing to accept the return of a pair of boots she purchased online. David first logs in the date and other pertinent customer information. He repeats and paraphrases what the customer says to ensure her that he is listening carefully. He tells her he understands her frustration and then asks her to explain how the problem occurred. He conveys his concern and apologizes for the inconvenience. David then goes on to politely explain that the online order process includes several notices that products ordered in this manner are to be returned using the return shipping label that is sent with each order. He further explains that the retail outlets have their own individual inventory systems and are not set up to handle and process returns from online purchases. David offers to send the customer another return label and also tells her that she can order a replacement pair of boots on which the shipping and handling charges will be waived. After David communicates the solution and ends the call with the customer, what is the next step he should take to complete the processing of the complaint?

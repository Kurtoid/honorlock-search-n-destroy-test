The following chart depicts the individual gain in resources each organism gets when moving to one patch, either a high quality or a low quality, depending on the order they colonize it.      #Individuals   High Quality Benefit   Low Quality Benefit      1   11   6.9     2   9   5.2     3   7   3.5     4   5   3.2     5   3   2.9     6   1   2.6     How many organisms would move to the high quality patch before any organism moves to the low quality patch if the ideal free distribution is met? [total] There are 10 individuals in the population, how many would there be in the high quality patch and how many would there be in the low quality patch respectively if the ideal free distribution is met?  High quality: [if10high] Low quality [if10low]

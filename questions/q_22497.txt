The human genome codes for a number of different G-proteins (24 a-subunits, 5 b-subunits, and 6 l-subunit), allowing for a great diversity of GPCRs. This diversity allows signaling through adenylyl cyclase, ion channels, and some phospholipases (enzymes that cleave phospholipids). Of the list below, what is a common component that is necessary by all of the possible combinations of G-proteins for productive signal transmission?

[5 points] Consider a 3-period lot sizing problem with the demand vector D = (30,40,25). The fixed production setup cost is $200, the unit variable production cost is $6, and the unit inventory holding cost is $2 per period. Assume that the initial inventory level and the ending inventory level must be zero. Find the optimal lot sizing schedule for this setting using the path enumeration method.        [5 points] A car rental company rents cars at a rate of $50 per day. Cars are rented for one day only. The company does not own its own cars but leases them on a daily basis from a large firm. The rental company must specify the number of cars it intends to lease on a given day. The daily lease fee paid to the firm is $30 per car per day. The rental company knows that the daily demand has a normal distribution with mean of 200 and variance of 121. If the company leases more cars than are requested as rentals, it will get back $12 for each car unrented. Find the optimal number of cars that the rental company should lease every day.

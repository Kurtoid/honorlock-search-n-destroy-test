Define a class called AdmissionsEntry that keeps track of information for an admissions candidate, how that candidate is rated by reviewers (real numbers between 0.0 and 5.0), and whether or not a candidate will be discussed. The class should have the following public methods:    AdmissionsEntry(id) constructs an AdmissionsEntry object with given ID   rate(rating) records a rating for the candidate   flag() indicates that the candidate should be discussed   getRating() returns the average rating (0.0 if no ratings)   toString() returns a String with ID and average rating   isBetter(AdmissionsEntry other) returns true if this entry is better than the passed in entry    Below is an example for a candidate that has been reviewed four times:  AdmissionsEntry entry = new AdmissionsEntry("2222222"); entry.rate(3.75); entry.rate(3.65); entry.rate(3.8); entry.rate(3.75); entry.flag(); After these calls, the call entry.getRating() would return 3.7375 (the average of the ratings). The toString method should return a string composed of the ID, a colon, and the average rating rounded to 2 digits after the decimal point ("2222222: 3.74" for this example). If there are no ratings, then getRating and toString should indicate a rating of 0.0. Each AdmissionsEntry object should keep track of whether that candidate should be discussed by the admissions committee. Any candidate who receives an individual score of 4.0 or higher should be discussed even if their average rating is below 4.0. Notice also that the flag method can be called, as in the example above, in which case the candidate will be discussed even if none of the ratings are 4.0 or higher. The isBetter method should return true if the AdmissionsEntry it is called on should be discussed and the passed in entry shouldn't. It should return false if the passed in AdmissionsEntry is flagged to be discussed but the AdmissionsEntry it is called on isn't. If they are either both discussed or both not discussed, return true if the current AdmissionsEntry has a higher average rating and false if the passed in AdmissionsEntry has a higher or equal rating.

11. In 2004, a random sample of 46 coyotes in a region of northern Minnesota showed the average age to be 2.05 years with a standard deviation of 0.82 years.  However, it is thought that the overall population mean age of coyotes is 1.75 years.  Test the hypothesis that coyotes in this region of northern Minnesota live longer than the average of 1.75 years.  (While answering the following sub-parts of this question, you will be including the null and alternative hypothesis, the test statistic, the p-value (a visualization and an interpretation), your statistical decision, and your conclusion in the context of the problem.) (a) Which of the following best represents the hypothesis for Step 1 the hypothesis test?

In the pancreatic b cells, glucokinase (similar to liver enzyme, high Km, high Vmax) participates in the b cells functioning as a glucose sensor (these cells respond to high blood glucose levels by releasing insulin). Glucose, imported into the b cells by the GLUT2 transporter, is metabolized through the glycolytic pathway to produce ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. The ATP produced binds to an ATP-dependent K+ channel leading to depolarization of the b cells and insulin release. Since b cell glucokinase is similar to the liver glucokinase, which of the following characteristics of glucokinase will also contribute to glucose sensing by the b cells?

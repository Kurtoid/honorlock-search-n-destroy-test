QUESTION 4 - 10 Points This question is based on the same facts as Question 3.  As part of the sale of her accounting practice, Francis met with her broker to put together a "deal book" that would be presented to potential buyers to show the value of Francis's accounting practice.  Francis presented this deal book to Ed as part of the negotiations over the sale of the business to Ed.  The deal book included 2020 year-end financial reports for Francis's accounting practice.  Ed was very impressed with the company's cash flow. Based on his review of the deal book and after completing additional extensive due diligence, Ed offered to buy Francis's accounting practice for $1.5 million dollars. Ed based his offer price, in large part, on the cash flow generated by the business. Francis agreed to proceed with the sale to Ed subject to execution of a final purchase agreement (the contract that is entered into between a buyer and seller of a business).  While Francis' attorneys were drafting a purchase agreement, Francis' broker presented her with revised 2020 year-end financial reports. The revised financial reports included a revised income statement that identified a significant adjustment to the company's expenses which had a substantial downward adjustment to the company's cash flow. Immediately, upon receipt Francis reviewed these revised financial reports and she observed the adjustment to cash flow. Francis did not share the revised financials with anyone. Following receipt of the revised year-end financial reports from her broker, Francis proceeded to close on the sale transaction with Ed. Ed did, in fact, pay $1.5 million for Francis' accounting practice.  After completing his purchase of the company, Ed contacted the broker Francis had used to prepare the deal book to obtain additional financial information, and at that time was provided with the revised 2020 year-end financial reports. Ed was surprised to learn of the significant adjustments to cash flow identified in those financials. Based on the information in the revised year-end financial reports Ed has determined that he should have paid no more than $1 million for the company, and has demanded that Francis agree to rescind the transaction. Francis has refused and Ed has sued Francis for fraud based on the fact that cash flow was overstated in the deal book. REQUIRED (10 Points): Will Ed prevail? In separately lettered or numbered paragraphs, discuss each of the elements of Ed's misrepresentation lawsuit. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS QUESTION, IGNORE THE POSSIBLE APPLICATION OF THE ECONOMIC LOSS DOCTRINE AND IGNORE ANY CLAIM FOR NONFRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION.

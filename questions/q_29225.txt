You are trying to decide whether your firm should use debt financing under different assumptions regarding the amount of debt in its capital structure. The firm's assets will generate an expected EBIT of $800,000 per year (beginning one year from today) in perpetuity. The firm will make no new capital or working capital investments and all assets are fully depreciated. The assets have a beta of 1.5, the risk-free rate is 5%, and the market risk premium is 10%. You can issue bonds at par paying an annual coupon at a 5% annual rate. The corporate tax rate is 50%, and the firm has 100,000 shares outstanding. What is the value of the firm if it issues $1.5 million of debt and uses the proceeds to repurchase 75,000 shares for $20?

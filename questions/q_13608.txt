The fastest way to fill out this form is to complete it online at www.fafsa.gov, but students can also fill out and mail in a paper version of the form. This form asks for information about students' financial situation and requires them to answer questions about their taxable and untaxed income and their assets, such as savings account balances and investments.

Each college uses the information it receives to calculate the amount of aid the student can receive; then, the college generates an award letter for the student. This application process must be completed every year a student is enrolled in school and needs financial aid.   This paragraph was written for an audience of

Thermal lens effect lab, Part 1. A schematic of the experimental setup for the thermal lens lab is shown below.    (a) (3 pts) Articulate your understanding of the "thermal lens effect". (b) (3 pts) A thermal lens spectroscopy lab was conducted using a dilute dye solution dissolved in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). A HeNe laser with a power of 5.00 mW was used for the experiment. The following voltage trace was obtained.    It was determined that Ibc = 32.0 a.u. and DIbc = 6.0 a.u. The thermal-optical data for carbon tetrachloride is given below:     Parameters   Value     k (mW/cm*K)   1.02     dn/dT (x 10-4 K-1)   -5.8     E/P (mW-1)   3.88     What is the absorbance of the solution? (c) (5 pts) The molar heat capacity of the solution under constant pressure can be calculated using the following equation: Define what M and tc is, respectively. How is M and tc calculated in this experiment?

Counting calories Seven girls and seven boys who were overweight took part in an experiment designed to reduce weight. Each child consumed exactly 1000 Cal per day and engaged in regular exercise. After three weeks of this treatment, the weight and blood cholesterol of the children were measured. Body weight and blood cholesterol were also recorded for a sample of 50 children of average weight from a nearby school. The overweight children had lost an average of 5 kg during the three weeks. The standard deviation of weight loss was 1 kg. On average, the overweight children who dieted and exercised had a lower cholesterol level than the average weight children did.      Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 11-15.   11. Replication of observations was achieved by using multiple girls and boys in each group.

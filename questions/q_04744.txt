Two normal doses of Viagra alone shouldn't give a man a heart attack. Tell the police to check the wine as well as diAngelo's blood samples from when he was admitted from the hospital. It wasn't just Viagra that she gave him!" Questions:  1. Why might Sherlock think a double dose of regular strength sildenafil (Viagra(r)) alone wouldn't kill a 55-year-old bidet sales executive?

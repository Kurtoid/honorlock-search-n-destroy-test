Colin flips a coin and Rose puts down one, two, or three fingers.  The game is zero-sum and goes like this:      Colin      Heads Tails   Rose 1 (5,-5) (-5,5)    2 (1,-1) (-1,1)    3 (-4,4) (-1,1)    Since Colin is not deciding, consider this a game against nature with Colin being nature.  Find which row would be preferred by LaPlace (the row with the highest row sum), Wald (the row with the highest minimum row entry), or Savage ( the row with the smallest maximum regret where the regret is the difference between an entry and the largest entry in the column.)  Label which is which.

The initial conditions (energy levels) for a laser active medium are E1 = -1.75 eV to E2 = -0.65 eV and temperature of 900 F. The active medium is beginning to be pumped and it will reach a stage when E1 = E2 = -1.1 eV, follow up by E1 reaching -1.75 eV and E2 will be -0.65 eV. Calculate the ratio of the numbers of atoms at the two energy levels in each case and discuss the effects on the population inversion and the absorption coefficient of the material.                                         14.

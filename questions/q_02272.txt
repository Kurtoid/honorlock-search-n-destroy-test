A researcher is conducting an experiment in which he is examining how different studying techniques influence grades in an elementary school class. He uses two 3rd grade classes: in one, he gives the students a new studying technique developed by experts to try for a semester, and the other class continues studying as they did before. He then gives them a comprehensive exam at the end of the semester to determine whether the study method worked. What is the hypothesis?

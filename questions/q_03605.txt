Managers at Massive Dynamics are evaluating a new industrial product. The product will sell at $[p] per unit for the next three years. The fixed cost and depreciation will be $[FCx],000 and $[Depx],000 per year, respectively, and variable costs will be $[VC] per unit. The production will not affect the firm's net working capital, but will require an initial investment of $[ICx],000 in fixed assets. The fixed assets will have an after-tax salvage value of $[ATSx],000 after three years. The managers, though, are not confident about their forecast of the quantity they will sell per year. They expect to sell [qx],000 units per year, but this forecast is only accurate within +-25 percent. If Massive Dynamics' tax rate is 21 percent and they require a return of [Rx] percent for new industrial products, what is the best-case NPV? (Enter your answer rounded to the nearest $0.01)

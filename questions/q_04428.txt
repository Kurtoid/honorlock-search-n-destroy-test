LE PETIT PRINCE: TRADUCTION La premiere etait habitee par un roi. Le roi siegeait, habille de pourpre et d'hermine, sur un trone tres simple et cependant majestueux. - Ah! Voila un sujet, s'ecria le roi quand il apercut le petit prince. Et le petit prince se demanda: - Comment peut-il me reconnaitre puisqu'il ne m'a encore jamais vu ! Il ne savait pas que, pour les rois, le monde est tres simplifie. Tous les hommes sont des sujets. - Approche-toi que je te voie mieux, lui dit le roi qui etait tout fier d'etre roi pour quelqu'un. Le petit prince chercha des yeux ou s'asseoir, mais la planete etait toute encombree par le magnifique manteau d'hermine. Il resta donc debout, et, comme il etait fatigue, il bailla. - Il est contraire a l'etiquette de bailler en presence d'un roi, lui dit le monarque. Je te l'interdis. - Je ne peux pas m'en empecher, repondit le petit prince tout confus. J'ai fait un long voyage et je n'ai pas dormi... - Alors, lui dit le roi, je t'ordonne de bailler. Je n'ai vu personne bailler depuis des annees. Les baillements sont pour moi des curiosites. Allons! baille encore. C'est un ordre. - Ca m'intimide... je ne peux plus... fit le petit prince tout rougissant. - Hum! Hum! repondit le roi. Alors je... je t'ordonne tantot de bailler et tantot de... Il bredouillait un peu et paraissait vexe.

A hospital requires some amount of certain radioactive element, molybdenum-99 (99Mo), for certain procedures. Based on the prescheduled appointments for the next month the required amount of 99Mo is  during day . Cost associated with acquiring 99Mo on day  depends on many factors and can be simplified as  per unit. There is also an upper bound  on how much 99Mo can be acquired on each day. Finally, due to its radioactive nature, 99Mo quickly decays at rate 20% per day. Assume that unlimited amount of  99Mo can be stored at the hospital.  Formulate the problem of determining minimum cost plan for the hospital to acquire and store 99Mo.  Write the LP model and explain all variables and constraints on your paper.  In the field below, only type one constraint that serves for connecting the amount of 99Mo from one day to the next.

Use the following scenario for the next 4 questions (Questions 11, 12, 13, and 14): A scientist notices that the radioactive element uranium (U) loses its toxicity when incubated in soil for several weeks. He wonders, "How is the soil detoxifying the uranium?" After several days in the university library, he uncovers a report that describes a soil bacterium that can detoxify uranium. He reasons that the native soil bacteria might be responsible for detoxifying the uranium. After splitting a soil sample into six equal portions, he sterilizes 3 portions using high heat and pressure (i.e., kills all bacteria in the sample), and the other 3 he leaves intact (normal live bacteria). Then he adds uranium to all samples and measures the toxicity of the uranium over the next several weeks. To his surprise, uranium from both the sterilized and the intact soil diminish in toxicity. 11. Clearly state the hypothesis tested in this experiment.

14. Part of the patient's treatment was hemodialysis in order to resolve uremia (increased blood urea), fluid overload and hypertension. In hemodialysis, the patient's blood and dialysis fluid contact through pores of semipermeable membrane. Your goal is to remove urea from the blood but keep other components of the blood (blood cells and glucose). Explain the hemodialysis conditions required to achieve this, including the type of transport, the relative concentrations of urea and glucose in the dialysis fluid, and the constraints. Unfortunately, size of urea and glucose is very similar. (10 pts, 100 words max) (unit 4 exam)

Diagnosis: Based on the laboratory evidence, baby Kayla was diagnosed with neonatal sepsis caused by Listeria monocytogenes, which was also found to be the cause of Sandy's illness.   Treatment: Baby Kayla was started on high-dose intravenous (IV) ampicillin shortly after birth. Although the mortality associated with neonatal listeriosis is high, rapid antibiotic treatment resulted in significant gains and she was extubated and breathing on her own in a few weeks. Sandy was also treated with ampicillin, because the bacteria had been found in her blood during testing. Ampicillin is an antibiotic that binds to enzymes called transpeptidases and block the active site. Transpeptidases normally catalyze a chemical reaction that creates peptide bonds between amino acids to crosslink peptidoglycan, which makes the bacterial cell wall rigid and strong.   Question 5: Would you expect ampicillin to be as effective when treating infections with Gram negative organisms?

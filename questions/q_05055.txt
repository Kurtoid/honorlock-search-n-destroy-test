The patient is a 46-year-old female, gravida 3, para 3, admitted to the hospital for a scheduled vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The patient has an extensive gynecologic history and was most recently seen for dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. She stated she was having prolonged, heavy menses with disturbing premenstrual syndrome that was lasting three to four days before the onset of the menses. Six months ago, an outpatient laparoscopy was performed and extensive endometriosis of the uterus ovaries, tubes, and pelvic peritoneum was found. Lysis of adhesion and ablation of the endometriosis was attempted, but due to the extensive nature of the disease, it was known the procedure would not be entirely successful. In addition, the patient has been diagnosed and treated for cervical dysplasia described as mild to moderate that was investigated with 11 different biopsies. All subsequent pap smears have been normal. Despite continued treatment, the patient still suffers from chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia. After discussing her treatment options, the patient consented to a vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy to treat the extensive endometriosis of the various sites previously described. The surgery was accomplished without difficulty, and the patient was able to go home on day three. An additional diagnosis was added to the record when the pathology report was reviewed by the surgeon. The pathologist'. report confirmed the endometriosis as well as a small lesion of the cervix that was found to be carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

Select the proper activity for each step in the union formation process.
Individuals of a particular species of ground beetle are either light tan or dark brown. Light-tan beetles are predominant in habitats with light-colored sandy soils, and dark brown beetles are predominant in habitats with dark-colored loam soils. In an experiment designed to determine the survival rates of light-tan beetles and dark brown beetles in different habitats, 500 light-tan beetles and 500 dark-brown beetles were released in each of four habitats. Each beetle had been marked with a small spot of red paint on the underside of its abdomen before it was released. One week after the beetles had been released, any marked beetles that could be found were recaptured. The results are presented in the table below. It is assumed that differences in the numbers of beetles recaptured are directly related to differences in survival rates. Which of the following can be inferred from the data in the table?

Image: Graph of temp versus energy. A line slopes up from the X axis and is labelled A and Solid. Then there a plateau labelled with B. Then there is a line that slopes up labelled with C and liquid. Then there is a plateau labelled with D. Then there is a line sloping up that is labelled with E and gas. End of image. Calculate the total energy required (in Joules) to bring {x} g of  compound "X" (MW ={w} g/mol) from {z} degrees C to {t} degrees C. Data :  melting point of X = {m} degrees C boiling point of X = {b}  degrees C c(s) (heat capacity solid X) = {s} J/g/ degrees C;  c(l) (heat capacity liquid X) = {l} J/g/ degrees C; c(g) (heat capacity gas X) = {g} J/g/ degrees C; DHfus (molar heat of fusion for X) = {f} kJ/mol DHvap (molar heat of vaporization for X) = {v} kJ/mol

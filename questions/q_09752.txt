Morgan breeds and sells snakes. He knows that he can make the most money by breeding and selling albino snakes. Albinism is a recessive trait. His female albino corn snake (aa) just produced six offspring. Two displayed normal coloration and four were albino. What do you know about the genotype of the father? Hint: try some Punnett square combinations.

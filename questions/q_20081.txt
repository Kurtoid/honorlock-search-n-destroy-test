WORKOUT PROBLEM 1  (40 points) (Nothing to submit here, just read the problem. Homework format/layout is NOT necessary but DETAILED SOLUTION must be uploaded.)    A constant force, F, of 200 N is applied horizontally to a block causing it to move up a ramp. The block has a mass of 4 kg and is initially at rest. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the block and the ramp are 0.35 and 0.2, respectively.  The ramp is 5 m long and is inclined at 30 degrees.   Draw a FBD Determine the velocity of the block when it reaches the top of the ramp. For full credit, you must use Conservation of Energy to find the velocity. Assuming the force F goes to zero when the block gets to the top of the ramp, determine the location, L, where the block hits the ground as shown on the figure.  Determine the magnitude and direction of the object's velocity just before impact with the ground.  Determine the maximum height of the block, H.

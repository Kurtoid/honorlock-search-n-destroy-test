When Taiwanese researchers studied 1,000 people, they found that the people who drank two cups of any kind of tea every week for ten years had 20 percent less body fat than people who didn't drink tea.

In 2003, scientists found out that after just three weeks of drinking five cups of black tea per day, fifteen people cut their cholesterol by 7 percent and their bad LDL cholesterol by 11 percent. Australian researchers studying 218 women found that tea reduced blood pressure; in fact, the more tea a person drank, the more blood pressure dropped. Coffee does not offer any of these health benefits, so tea is clearly the better beverage choice.   The subject of this paragraph is

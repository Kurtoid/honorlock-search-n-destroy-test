A pedestrian from State A was injured when he was struck by a pizza delivery car driven by a citizen of State A. The pizzeria is a citizen of State B.

The pizzeria claims, as an affirmative defense, that it is not liable to the pedestrian because the delivery driver was not within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred and that the delivery driver's negligence was the sole cause of the pedestrian's injuries. Alternatively, the pizzeria claims in a third-party complaint that if it is found liable to the pedestrian, the pizzeria's employment contract with the delivery driver requires it to reimburse the pizzeria the first $1,000 of the damages. The delivery driver promptly moves to dismiss the third-party complaint. Should the court grant the delivery driver's motion?

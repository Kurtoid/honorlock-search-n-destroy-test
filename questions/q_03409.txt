When you save your file use your last and first names followed by Test1 (i.e. CarperAlanTest1).Application Test 1 Workbook.xlsx   Step 2: Upload and Submit the Test At the 52-minute mark, begin uploading your file. Click on the "Choose a File" button below, navigate to your desktop where your completed Excel workbook is located, click on the file, and click "Submit Quiz." If you failed to keep track of your time and the test closes because it timed out, e-mail me your test. I will deduct 5% per minute late. WARNING: Save your work often! I have had many students simply open the file, work on the whole thing without saving only to have something horrible happen and lose all work when they went to upload the file. If you fail to save you work to your computer and you lose your file, you will receive zero points for this test and no makeups will be provided.
A survey crew has set offset stakes for construction of the 8" sewer shown in the design plan below. When the existing 12"sewer line is uncovered for the construction of Maintenance Hole (MH) 1, it is found that the actual flow line elevation is 1,228.69' rather than the design elevation of 1,228.47'. The gradient must be revised, holding the flow line elevation of 1,229.27' at MH 2. If the elevation of the grade stake is 1,235.06, the cut (feet) to the flow line that you would mark on the stake at Station 1+25 is most nearly:

A 17-year-old female high school student with a history of sickle cell disease presents to the primary care nurse practitioner with acute onset of diffuse pain consistent with sickle cell crisis. She participated in 4 events at a competitive track meet earlier in the day which was hot and humid.  The nurse practitioner anticipates that which of the following laboratory values will be lower than the reported reference range in her laboratory diagnostics?
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Large right subdural hematoma POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Large right subdural hematoma PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Right craniotomy with evacuation of subdural hematoma HISTORY: This 58-year-old patient was transferred from an outside hospital after she was found unresponsive. She was on Coumadin, and she was found to have a large right-sided subdural hematoma with significant midline shift. On exam, she is noted to have, anisocoria and large right pupil, decerebrating, to pain. The patient had received Fresh frozen plasma as well as factor VII and emergently rushed to the operating room. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the general operating theater. Following the induction of general anesthesia, the patient was supine. The scalp was clipped, prepped and draped. We made a hairline incision frontal temporal parietal, reflecting it and incised down through the temporalis muscle. Fascia reflected with the skin flap. Bone flap was elevated without dural violation, tacked up to the bone edges with 4-0 Nurolon. As the dura was tacked up, the dura was opened. We encountered a very large subdural membrane. We circumferentially evacuated the hematoma and    removed the clot. This was coagulated, and the bleeding was stopped. We copiously irrigated,  inspecting the edges to make sure there was no venous bleeding. All seemed dry. We next reapproximated the dura with 4-0 Nurolon. Bone was placed back in place. Temporalis muscle and fascia were approximated with 2-0 Vicryl, the galea with inverted interrupted 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with staples. Following this procedure, all instrument, sponge, needle and padding counts were correct.

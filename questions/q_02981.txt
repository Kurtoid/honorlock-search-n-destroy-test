You recently graduated from Scheller College of Business and joined the business development team of "Some Limits Co.."  To expand the firm's business, you found "No Limit Co."  as a good target. On the other hand, your team members do not agree with you.  As per your team members, the "No Limits Co." is making losses and the average capital expenditure growth factor is very high.  While you noticed an interesting pattern in capital growth. At the beginning of the year 2025, there is an expansion option available conditional on positive news. While the firm can abandon the project after observing the news. If the news is positive, the firm would expand with higher growth in revenue and also an increase in capital expenditure. On the other hand, if the news is negative, the firm will not grow, and the revenue and capital expenditure reduce.

Assume that a user space application is implemented in a way to create a child process and a pipe and to let the parent and child processes communicate through the pipe. The child is supposed to write "CHILD SALUTES THE PARENT" to the pipe and the parent is supposed to read this message from the pipe. Then they both terminate. This question has three parts: 1) Write a snippet of code in which the parent process and the child process communicate successfully, i.e., the parent reads the message and they both terminate normally. 2) Explain how you would change the code in your answer to part 1) so that the child process receives a SIGPIPE signal. 3) Explain how you would change the code in your answer to part 1) so that the parent process hangs, i.e., blocked indefinitely, on reading from the pipe.

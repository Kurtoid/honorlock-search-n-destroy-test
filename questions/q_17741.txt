Competing Carp Two species of fish have coexisted in a lake for many years. Recently, the abundance of one species has started to decline. Some researchers blame the decline on a drop in the lake's oxygen concentration, resulting from global warming. To assess this hypothesis, the researchers conducted experiments to learn how the species respond to oxygen concentration. The figure below shows the information derived from these experiments. The parameter r1 is the intrinsic rate of increase for the declining species (species 1). The parameter K1 and K2 are the carrying capacities of species 1 and 2, respectively. The parameter a is the competitive effect of species 2 on species 1. Note that lower oxygen concentrations correspond to fewer parts per million (ppm).    Use this information and your knowledge about biology to answer questions 6-10.   6. The two species have completely different fundamental niches.

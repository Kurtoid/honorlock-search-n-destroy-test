Base your answers to the following 1 to 7 question(s) on the graph below, depicting an action potential.    Every cell in our body has a cell membrane that separates it from the outer environment of the tissue. The concentration of different ions across the cell membrane is different. As a result, polarity is established on the two sides of the membrane. This is called membrane potential. Most of the cells have more negative ions on the inner side of the membrane. Thus, most of the cells have negative membrane potential. Refer to the graph above. The parts of the graph indicated at points C, D, and E represent

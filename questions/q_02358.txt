Use the definition of the derivative to find the derivative of the function f(x)=x2+4x+2{"version":"1.1","math":"f(x)=x2+4x+2"}. You must use the definition of the derivative for this problem. You may not use any of our shortcuts for finding derivatives for this problem.  Because I care about how you work this problem, you MUST upload your work for this problem to the Dropbox folder "Work for Test #1" or you will not get any points for this problem. You will be graded on your work for this problem. The definition of the derivative says that  f'(x) = limh-0f(x+h)-f(x)h{"version":"1.1","math":"f'(x) = limh-0f(x+h)-f(x)h"}.

A flexible manufacturing system consists of a load/unload station and two machining workstations. Station 1 is the load/unload station and uses one server (material handling worker).  Station 2 performs drilling operations and consists of three servers (three identical CNC drilling machines). Station 3 has two servers that performs thread tapping (two identical CNC drill presses). The stations are connected by a part handling system that has two work carriers. The mean transport time is 2.2 minutes. The FMS produces two parts, A and B. The part mix fractions and process routings for the two parts are in the table.  Operation frequency fijk = 1.0 for all operations. Determine (a) (2pt) workload (in minutes) for each station (including the material handling), (b) (2pt) WLi/si ratio for each station (including material handling), and (c) (1pt) identify the bottleneck station.

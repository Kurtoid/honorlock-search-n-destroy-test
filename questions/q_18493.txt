You were running out your house this morning and forgot to grab breakfast even though you have an exam in A & P today.  So, you are now attempting to take this exam on an empty stomach.  As a result, your blood sugar levels are lower than normal.  These lower blood sugar levels are detected by glucose receptors on alpha cells in the pancreas. As a result of receiving that information, the alpha cells release a hormone called glucagon.  Glucagon travels through the blood stream until it reaches the liver.  Within the liver, glucagon stimulates the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase A to convert glycogen to glucose (see the chemical equation below).  The release of glucagon from the alpha cells in the pancreas continues until blood glucose levels are elevated into the normal range.  Glycogen phosphorylase A also inhibits the enzyme glucose synthetase (GS). GS converts glucose into glycogen. (4.5 pts.)  A. In general, what is the function of an enzyme? (0.5) B. Would glycogen phosphorylase A be able to convert a protein into its respective amino acids?  Explain your reasoning. (1) C. If a medication was able to activate GS, independent of the presence of glycogen phosphorylase A, what would happen to blood glucose levels? What hormone might this mimic? Explain your reasoning. (1) D. Explain what would happen to glucose synthetase if the temperature of the body increased above 40 degrees Celsius. (0.5) E. Which substrate normally binds to the active site of glycogen phosphorylase? Medication inhibits glycogen phosphorylase A by binding to the allosteric site of the enzyme. This medication is said to be what type of inhibitor? (1)

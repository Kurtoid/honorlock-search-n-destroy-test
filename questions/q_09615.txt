Indicate whether the following statement is true or false.  An analyst estimates that a company's invested capital is $300 million, which is also its book value.  The analyst also estimates that the present value of the company's free cash flows is $500 million.  These calculations imply that the present value of the company's EVA is $800 million.

A plot of the velocity vs. time for a particle moving in one dimension is shown below.  The particle starts from rest at t = 0 seconds and accelerates at a constant rate until t = 2 seconds, when the velocity is 5 m/s.  The particle continues at this speed until t = 5 s and then slows at a constant rate until t = 8 s, when its velocity is zero.  What is the average velocity of the particle between 2 and 8 seconds?
Find the mean for the given sample data. Unless indicated otherwise, round your answer to one more decimal place than is present in the original data values.Andrew asked seven of his friends how many cousins they had. The results are listed below. Find the mean number of cousins. 18 12 7 13 7 2 7
A researcher would like to evaluate the effect of a new reading program for second-grade students. She has half of the second-grade students use the new reading program for the first half of the school year and use the current reading program for the second half of the year. The other half of the second-grade students use the current reading program for the first half of the school year and use the new reading program for the second half of the year. The researcher plans to use the data from this study to test whether the new program had a significant effect on reading scores. Which of the following hypothesis tests would be appropriate?
Which correlation illustrates the strongest relationship between two variables?
Identify the cerebral lobe labelled A.
A state constructs an office building. The construction is financed with: (1) a transfer of $1 million from the General Fund; (2) a grant of $2 million from the federal government; (3) bond proceeds of $7 million; and (4) earnings of $100,000 from temporary investment of bond proceeds. All transactions occur in one year. 15. Based on the preceding set of facts, how much should be reported as Other financing sources in the Capital Projects Fund?
Naltrexone (ReVia) is prescribed for a patient with alcohol dependency. What information should the nurse provide to the patient? Select all that apply.

What is the best rationale for administering a medication to a pregnant client that is potentially toxic to the unborn baby?
A population consists of the values 0, 4 and 6.  Construct the sampling distribution for sample means for samples of size 2 taken with replacement. In the blank, record the highest probability that appears in your chart.
2. Cross Validation (12 points) Imagine that we want to train a neural network using back-propagation. In order to determine the amount of training, a simple validation technique is employed. Specifically, we randomly split the available samples into two equal-sized parts, one for training and one for validation. (a) Describe the qualitative behavior of the network on the training and validation sets. If the x-axis the number of training iterations and the y-axis the error, this single graph should have two curves, one for the error on the validation set and one on the training set. Describe the features of the curves. Now imagine that you suddenly have ten times as much data as you had before but you are using the same network structure and learning algorithm: (b) Would you expect the training curve to be different? If so, describe the difference between the old and the new curves, and explain your reasoning. (c) Would you expect the validation curve to be different? If so, describe the difference between the old and the new curves, and explain your reasoning. Clearly mark your answers with (a), (b) or (c).

For the following three questions (36-38), consider a study in which a researcher tested candidate ion-channel blockers (A, B, and C) and measured single-channel open probability (an index of channel activity) to examine their effects on a K+ channel. The researcher obtained the data contained in the following table.    Candidate blocker Single-channel open probability, Po (SD) n   Control 0.81 (0.13) 6   A 0.83 (0.10) 6   B 0.66 (0.07) 5   C 0.16 (0.09) 5    The researcher chose to present these data by using only the following graph and figure legend.          Fig. 2. Effects of blockers on single-channel open probability (Po). Po was measured in n cells that were untreated (0.81 +- 0.13, n = 6), or treated with blocker A (0.83 +- 0.10, n = 6), blocker B (0.66 +- 0.07, n = 5), or blocker C (0.16 +- 0.09, n = 5). Student's t tests proved that candidate blockers B (*P = 0.0467) and C (**P = 0.00000588) statistically significantly blocked channel activity. Data are mean +- SD.     Which one of the following is a valid criticism of the analysis?

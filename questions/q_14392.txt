On June 1, 2020, Everly Bottle Company sold $1,000,000 in long-term bonds. The bonds will mature in 10 years and have a stated interest rate of 8% and a yield rate of 11%. The bonds pay interest annually on May 31 of each year. The bonds are to be accounted for under the effective-interest method. Required:(a)    Determine the bond selling price. Then construct a bond amortization table for this problem to indicate the amount of interest expense and discount amortization at each May 31. Make sure all columns and rows are properly labeled.  (Display amounts in Excel to the nearest whole dollar.) (b)    Assuming that interest and discount amortization are recorded each May 31, prepare the adjusting entry to be made on December 31, 2022, and the interest payment on May 31, 2023. (Display amounts in Excel to the nearest whole dollar.)

Use the picture, variables, and problem setup from here to answer this and the following three questions. The answer to part a is the answer to this question. The following parts are answered in questions 22 and 23. A very long coaxial cable consists of an inner solid cylinder of radius  and an outer shell of radius  , where  = [a] cm, as pictured.  The inner conductor carries a current  = [i1] A with uniform current density and the outer conductor carries a total current  = [i2] A that is uniformly distributed over the circumference (positive currents are out of the screen and negative currents are into the screen).  (7 pts) Find the magnitude of magnetic field a distance [ra] from the center of the inner conductor. (7 pts, Q22) Find the magnitude of magnetic field a distance [rb] from the center of the inner conductor. (7 pts, Q23) Find the magnitude of magnetic field a distance [rc] from the center of the inner conductor.  Enter the magnetic field from part a in units of mT.

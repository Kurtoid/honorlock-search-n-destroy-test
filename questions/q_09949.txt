What would the nurse identify as a primary difference between traditional and nontraditional collective bargaining?
Differentiate between Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes.  Give the characteristics for each type of cell that cause it to be either a prokaryote or eukaryote.  You can make this in a list form if you would like.  Be sure to include the differences in terms of:      cellular structure differences ( 1/2 pt each)     size differences    ( 1/4 pt each)     domains these are found in ( 1/4 pt each )

Write the answer to the following questions in the space provided: 31 (a) The rate constant (k) for a reaction was measured as a function of temperature. A plot of lnk versus 1/T(in Kelvin) is linear and has a slope of  -7445 K. Calculate the activation energy, Ea for the reaction. (use the relationship: slope = - Ea/R)                                                                               [2 points]                                                                                                                                        31(b) The diagram shows the energy of a reaction as the reaction progresses. Label the diagram with the following                   [2 points]  a) reactants b) products c) activation energy (Ea) d) enthalpy of reaction ([?]H) e) activated complex f) energy of dissociation g) endothermic process   31 (c) According to the diagram the activation energy of the reverse reaction is greater / less than the forward reaction.

An analyst has estimated the following free cash flows for Clark Company: -The free cash flow for the first year (paid at t = 1) = $100 million. -The free cash flow for the second year (paid at t = 2) = $110 million. -The free cash flow for the third year (paid at t = 3) = $120 million. -After t = 3, the free cash flows will grow at a constant rate of 3% per year.  You can assume that the free cash flow at t = 4 = $123.60 million.  In other words, you don't need to worry about the complications that we discussed regarding the calculation of continuing value. -Since we are assuming that the cash flows are paid at the end of the year, there is no reason to employ a mid-year adjustment. The analyst has also collected some additional information about Clark Company: -The company's WACC = 10%. -Once again:  All cash flows are received and paid at the end of the year, so there is no need for you to do a mid-year adjustment. -The company's non-operating asset consists of excess cash, which totals $300 million. -The market value of debt equals $498.5832 million. -The company has 10 million shares of common stock outstanding. What is the per-share estimate of the company's stock price?

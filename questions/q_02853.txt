Tracking studies are studies that involve the monitoring of the same variables of interest, such as market share or unit sales, over time. These types of studies are an example of:

Enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) is a virus that can cause mild to severe respiratory symptoms, especially in children. Since 1987, small numbers of EV-D68 cases in the US have been reported regularly to CDC. The number of people with new, confirmed EV-D68 infection was much greater in 2014 than that reported in previous years. The term that best describes the status of EV-D68 in 2014 is

Perform the following hypothesis test: A particular brand of tires claims that its deluxe tire averages at least 50,000 miles before it needs to be replaced. From past studies of this tire, the standard deviation is known to be 8,000. A survey of owners of that tire design is conducted. From the 28 tires surveyed, the mean lifespan was 46,500 miles with a standard deviation of 9,800 miles. Using alpha = 0.05, is the data highly inconsistent with the claim? (You may assume that the underlying population is normally distributed.)   Is this a test of one mean or proportion? [a1] State the claim in mathematical form. [a2] (This is the [a16] hypothesis.) Identify the null and alternative hypothesis. H0: [a3] HA: [a4] We will use the [a5] distribution because the population standard deviation is [a6]. Is this a left, right, or two-tailed test? Select the matching graph. [a15] A. B. C. State the significance level. a = [a8] Calculate the p-value using technology. p-value = [a7] Compare the p-value to the significance level. p-value [a9] a, meaning that we will [a10] the H0. Therefore, because we [a11] the H0  and the original claim was the [a12], we find that there [a13] sufficient evidence to [a14] of the claim that its deluxe tire averages at least 50,000 miles before it needs to be replaced.
The figure represents the initial contents of a reaction vessel mixture of nitrogen monoxide (NO) and oxygen (O2) at a pressure of 1 atm.  Keeping the volume and temperature constant, what are the final total pressure (Ptot) and partial pressure of nitrogen dioxide (PNO2) when the reaction is complete (assuming a 100% yield)?             2NO(g) + O2(g)2NO2(g)             Data sheet and Periodic Table

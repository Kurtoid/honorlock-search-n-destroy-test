Two kids, A and B, are on a balanced seesaw with the pivot point located at the center of the seesaw as shown below. Mass of A = 30 kg and mass of B = 40 kg. Seesaw has a mass of 25 kg.  A)  Kid A sits 1.5 m from the pivot point of the balanced seesaw. Calculate the torque provided by A.  (5 points) B) Calculate the distance from the pivot point to B when the seesaw is balanced and A sits 1.5 m from the pivot point. (5 points) C) Calculate the the normal force (support force) provided by the pivot point on the seesaw. (5 points) D) Now A moves closer to the pivot point so that the distance from A to pivot point is 1 m, and B remains at the same position.  What is the net torque on the seesaw?  Clearly state whether the net torque is clockwise or counterclockwise. (4 points for magnitude, 1 point for direction) E) As A sits 1 m from the fulcrum, B decides to move to maintain the balance. Calculate the new distance from B to pivot point that keeps the seesaw balanced. (5 points)

In the year in which it intends to go public, ABC has revenues of $25 million and net income after taxes of $2.5 million. The firm has no debt, and revenue is expected to grow at 30% annually for the next five years and 4% annually after that. Net profit margins are expected to remain constant throughout. Capital expenditures are expected to grow in line with depreciation, and working capital requirements are minimal. The average beta of a publicly-traded company in this industry is 2, and the average debt/equity ratio is 30%. The firm is managed very conservatively and does not intend to borrow through the foreseeable future. The Treasury bond rate is 7%, and the marginal tax rate is 28%. The normal spread between the return on stocks and the risk-free rate of return is believed to be 5.5%. Reflecting the slower growth rate in the sixth year and beyond, the discount rate is expected to decline by 5 percentage points. Estimate the value of the firm's equity.

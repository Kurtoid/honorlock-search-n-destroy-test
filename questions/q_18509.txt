Some students have been told that people remember words that are written in green ink better than red ink. Therefore, I collected data from 2 sections of Psych 202. My 2:30 pm class had a list of words in green ink to memorize. My 4:00 pm class had a list of words in red ink to memorize. After a delay, student recalled as many words as they could. My 4:00 pm class with green ink (group 1) had a mean of 25.2 words, SS = 1030, n = 36. My 2:30 pm class with red ink (group 2) had a mean of 22.5 words, SS = 930, n = 36. Together their pooled variance is 28. Use the 7 steps of hypothesis testing to conduct an independent samples t-test that answers this question and use an a = .01. 1) IV: [IV] DV: [DV] number of tails: [tails] 2) State Hypotheses: Null: [Null] Alternative: [Alternative] 3) What is your critical value? [critical] 4) Calculate the appropriate test statistic. Show your work. Numerator = [Numerator] Denominator = [Denominator] Final obtained test statistic = [TestStat] 5) Decision: [Decision] 6) Effect size: Calculation/work: [Calculation] Final effect size value = [Effect] 7) Plain English interpretation: [PE] APA statistical information: [APA]

Consider in this question and the following questions a real elastic solid (not to be confused with the fluid solid described previously in this class). Reversible work can be done on this system only by shearing it. In this case, the amount of reversible work done d W_r by a small change in the strain, d e, is s d e, where s is the stress. Write down the fundamental equation for such a system and use it to derive two equations of state and a Maxwell relation.

A client is admitted to the maternity care department.  She has been having contractions intermittently at 10 to 20-minute intervals for the last 6 hours.  The contractions are relieved by ambulation.  Her estimated due date is 2 weeks away.  The physician examines her and finds her to be 1 cm dilated and 10% effaced. The nurse would determine that these contractions are most likely which of the following?

An open box (no lid) is to have a square base. The  enclosed volume of this box is to be 864 in3.  The goal of this problem is to find the dimensions that will produce a box that will use as little surface area as possible.  To answer this question, consider the following:  Let x = the length of the base and let y = the height of the box.  a)    You know that volume = length x width x height. Using the given information, write an equation for the volume, then solve it for y.  b)    The surface area is the sum of the areas of all sides. In this situation with no lid, the surface area is S = 4xy + x2.  Substitute what you got for y in (a) and simplify. This is the surface area function, S(x).  c)   Take it from here. Find the dimensions (x and y) that will minimize the surface area. If rounding is necessary, do so to the nearest tenth.

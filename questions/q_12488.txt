You can use any calculator or there is a scientific calculator in the browser. Note that you cannot print out the periodic table or equation page during the exam. Make sure you have paper and pencil so you can show your work. After you finish the exam, you must upload a scan (pdf file) of your work within 15 minutes. Be ready to do this (but no phones, etc. allowed during the exam)! Many of the questions will ask you to show your work on paper to get full credit. This will also allow me to give you partial credit on certain problems. Write your name on every page and section on the first page. You must label the work for each question that requires work using the question number and circle your answer. Don't cram this into a small space - spread it out and make it easily readable for Dr Sue. On your work, don't forget to use correct sig figs and put units on every number and each answer. There will be a penalty up to full points off for the problems that require work to be shown if you do not upload of work that supports your answer. Some of the problems require manual grading therefore no score will be shown when you finish! I may decide to curve the results or alter question points if necessary.

38. Choose the answer that has these events of protein synthesis (translation) in the proper sequence. 1. A new aminoacyl-tRNA binds to the A site (codon recognition)2. A peptide bond forms between the new amino acid and a growing polypeptide chain in A site (peptide bond formation)3. Empty tRNA leaves the E site, the P site tRNA carries the growing amino acid chain, and the A site remains vacant ready for next aminoacyl-tRNA 4. A small ribosomal subunit binds with mRNA, the large ribosomal subunit binds, and the initiator tRNA carrying MET amino acid binds to the P site (initiation) 5. tRNA carrying the growing polypeptide translocates from A site to the P site and empty tRNA moves from P to E site (translocation)

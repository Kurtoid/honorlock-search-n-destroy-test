BONUS QUESTION: (4pts possible) A horse's coat color is controlled by many different gene pairs. The dominant allele B produces a black horse, and the recessive allele b will give the horse a chestnut color. However, when a dominant W allele is present in the second gene pair, the horse will be white no matter what. The recessive allele w does not affect coat color. Furthermore, horses can also be bay in color. The dominant allele A for this gene masks the dominant black color to produce bay, but it does not mask the white gene or the recessive chestnut color. The recessive allele a does not affect coat color. What phenotypic classes and relative ratios of each can be expected from the cross of a heterozygous white mare that is heterozygous for bay and homozygous for chestnut with a heterozygous bay stallion that is heterozygous for black?

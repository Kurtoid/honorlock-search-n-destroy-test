In a random sample of 9 randomly selected seawater samples, the mean sodium chloride concentration was 23 cubic centimeters per cubic meter and the standard deviation was 6.7 cubic centimeters per cubic meter. Assume the distribution sodium chloride concentrations is normal.  Find 95% confidence interval estimate for the mean sodium chloride concentrations for all seawater samples.
The following temperature data is acquired using a thermocouple. The temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius and the true standard deviation is [Temp] oC.    [t1] [t2] [t3] [t4] [t5] [t6] [t7] [t8] [t9] [t10] [t11]    Suppose that you wanted to be 95% confident that the error in estimating the mean temperature is less than [e]oC.

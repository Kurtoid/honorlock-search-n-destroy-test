To uphold UNF's Academic Code of Integrity, you are being monitored while taking this exam.    PUT AWAY YOUR PHONE. DO NOT BE TEMPTED TO USE IT. I have seen so many students get caught using their phones on proctored exams, even when they think it can't be seen. There are ways that the proctors can tell. Please don't do it. I give you plenty of opportunities to redeem bad grades. It is better to fail this test than to get expelled. You're an Osprey, so act like one. CLOSE ALL OTHER PROGRAMS AND BROWSER WINDOWS DO NOT USE NOTES, BOOKS, THE INTERNET, FRIENDS, OR OTHER RESOURCES DURING THE EXAM.  KEEP YOUR FACE VISIBLE TO THE CAMERA AT ALL TIMES.  Failure to follow these rules will result in your exam being flagged and me having to watch it (I don't want to). Please remember that this is a test about how much you have learned, not about your ability to look up answers to questions you don't know. We don't give college degrees for googling.  DO NOT COPY THE EXAM OR TAKE SCREENSHOTS. You will be able to view your exam and see which questions you got wrong for a couple of weeks after the due date. (Please do not copy it then, either. Thank you.) Sorry about all that. Please relax. I don't want this to be stressful for you. I am simply trying to make sure it's you taking the exam without help.  Thank you, and best wishes!  PLEASE TYPE THE WORD "YES" IN THE SPACE BELOW TO INDICATE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREED TO THE ABOVE STATEMENTS. DURING YOUR EXAM, MAKE SURE YOUR ENTIRE FACE IS VISIBLE TO YOUR CAMERA AT ALL TIMES.  BEST WISHES!

Melinda lives next door to a home that has been foreclosed upon by the bank and has been sitting vacant for two years. The home has been repeatedly vandalized and left in a state of disrepair, and the bank only rarely bothers to have the grass mowed. Melinda wants to sell her own home, but she is convinced that the decaying home next door will scare off buyers. She is so frustrated that she decides to burn down the empty house. She has no idea that a homeless man has taken up residence there. (He would come and go through an unlocked window in the back of the house, and he was always careful not to be observed.) Melinda actually walks around the home before setting fire to it, just to be sure that there is no sign of anyone around. She doesn't see anything.

Hydraulic conductivity of soil is measured as 2x10-2  cm/sec.  After an accident, a truck carrying dissolved salt solution releases its contents to surface.  The distance between the spill and a groundwater well is 1600 meter.  The groundwater elevation at the spill location is 5.5 meter and well location is 5.3 meters. Porosity of soil is 0.4.  For the scenario described, seepage velocity is most nearly (m/day) (Hint:  First convert hydraulic conductivity from cm/sec to m/d units):

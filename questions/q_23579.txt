A genetics student recently learned of the connection between telomerase and cancer. Curious as to whether he is at risk for developing cancer, he sneaks into a lab at night to analyze his DNA. He isolates DNA from his skin cells and applies PCR using primers specific to the telomerase gene. He runs a gel on his PCR reaction and sees that he has a PCR product on the gel.

To establish the scale of the solar system, we need to measure the distance to one object orbiting the Sun. Venus was first used for this purpose, but in the 1930's astronomers organized an international campaign to measure the distance to:
Yellow bone marrow manufactures most of the blood cells.
QUESTION 6     A motor with a siren that reproduces a sound with a frequency of 1000Hz approaches a stationary person at a constant speed of 25m.s-1. The observer measures the frequency of the incoming siren as 1085,4Hz. The moment the car passes the observer, the speed of the car changes. As the siren moves away from the observer, it moves at a new constant speed. The new frequency measured by the observer is 925,3 Hz. Ignore air friction.     6.1   Name the effect that describes the above observation.   (2)     6.2   Calculate the speed of the sound waves in air.   (5)     6.3   Calculate the speed of the car as it moves away from the observer.   (5)     6.4   Will the same phenomenon be observed with a car and the observer if there is no sound but only the lights of the siren? Give a reason for your answer.   (3)     6.5   What evidence do astronomers have that the universe is expanding?   (2)     6.6   The absorption spectrum of nitrogen gas has a green frequency in the continuous spectrum. After 5 years of observation, the green frequency is seen to move to the yellow frequency. Is this phenomenon a redshift or blueshift?   (2)             [19]

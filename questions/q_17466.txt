Consider the following library class that can read or write to a file. Note that a file must be open in order for operations to be performed on it. For brevity, we have not included the actual implementation of the functions but only the code relating to the current state: public class File { private final static int CLOSED = 0; private final static int OPEN = 1; private int state; public File() { state = CLOSED; } public void open() { assert(state == CLOSED); state = OPEN; } public String read() { assert(state == OPEN); } public void write() { } public void close() { assert(state == OPEN); state = CLOSED; } } Consider each of the below five tests individually. Answer whether that test can ever possibly be generated by Randoop. If yes, explain whether Randoop 1. Discards the test as illegal, or 2. Reports the test as a bug, or 3. Adds the test to components for future extension. For simplicity, assume that Randoop does not check for redundancy, and that the contracts it checks (not shown for brevity) are standard ones (e.g., equals and hashCode).    Test Can ever be generated? If yes, what outcome?    File f = new File();String s = f.read();  [test1]    File f = new File();f.open();f.close();String s = f.read();  [test2]    File f = new File();f.open();String s = f.read(); if (s.length == 0) f.close();   [test3]    File f = new File();f.open();String s = f.read();f.close();  [test4]    File f = new File();f.close();String s = f.read();  [test5]    File f = new File();f.open();String s = f.read();f.close();f.write();   [test6]

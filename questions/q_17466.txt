Read the selected passage below from Walt Whitman's "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry."  Then, choose the most appropriate definition of the word disintegrated as it is used in the passage. The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours ofthe day, The simple, compact, well-join'd scheme, myself disintegrated,every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme, The similitudes of the past and those of the future, The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings,on the walk in the street and the passage over the river, The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away, The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them, The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.

A random sample of records of sales of homes over a 3-month period by the National Association of Realtors gives the price (in $) and size (in square feet) of 117 homes.  A linear regression model to predict sales price from size is determined from the data to be  y = 47820 + 61x.  Based on this equation the correlation between sales price and home size would be

Here's a static method called printElement that accepts an int array (called numbers) and an int (called index).  Its simple goal is to print the value at index.      public static void printElement(int[] numbers, int index) {         if (numbers == null) {            System.out.println("The array doesn't exist");            System.out.println("Done");            return;         }         if ((index < 0) || (index >= numbers.length)) {            System.out.println("The index doesn't exist");            System.out.println("Done");            return;         }         System.out.println(numbers[index]);         System.out.println("Done");     }      Notice that the method uses two if statements to check for and handle a couple of potential runtime errors.  Write a version of this method that catches exceptions (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and NullPointerException), instead of using if statements.  That is, your version should have the same behavior as the given method under these exceptional cases. There should be no if statements in your answer.  Finally, notice that regardless of what happens, the program always prints the String "Done".  There are three of the following statements in the method that help achieve that behavior:             System.out.println("Done"); Make sure that your solution has only one case of this particular statement.  TIP: there's a way to make sure that a set of statements execute regardless of whether or not there's an exception.  Use that construct

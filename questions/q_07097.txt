Fiber Dyes (Canvas Q9~12, Handwritten Pages Q9/12) Background: Staci is a chemist that dabbles in yarn dyeing in her spare time, and wants to synthesize her own dyes for small-batch yarn sales at her local market. She is planning to make a chromium-based dye, due to the wide range of color chromium dyes can take. In order to make a purple (specifically, mauve) dye, Staci needs high-purity chromium(III) chloride and plans on making it from chromium(III) oxide and carbon tetrachloride. The balanced equation for this reaction is shown below. 2 Cr2O3 (s) + 3 CCl4 (l) - 4 CrCl3 (s) + 3 CO2 (g)(green)         (colorless)             (violet)                        Question: Staci is performing a medium-scale test to see how efficient her synthesis actually is. She starts with 12.[Cr2O3] g chromium(III) oxide and 16.[CCl4] g carbon tetrachloride. How many grams of chromium(III) chloride could theoretically be produced with these quantities of starting materials?

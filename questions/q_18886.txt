Skin of Our Teeth ("Skin"), a business that is about to open a new video arcade in Oklahoma City, has ordered ten new video arcade games from the Nauseatingly Violent Video Company ("Nauseating"). The terms of the agreement are that Skin will pay $1500 in advance, with the balance of $5000 due in equal installments in three and six months. Upon receiving the order and Skin's check for $1500, Nauseating wires its acceptance of the order, advising that the machines will be shipped in three weeks. However, when Nauseating deposits the $1500 check, the bank will not honor it because Skin has insufficient funds in its account. Nauseating does a credit check and determines that Skin is insolvent. Nauseating writes to Skin stating that it will ship the machines, but only upon receipt of written assurances of performance by Skin. Thirty days later, Skin writes back threatening that if Nauseating does not send the video games immediately, it will buy the games elsewhere and sue Nauseating for any difference in the price paid. If Nauseating does not ship the machines as requested, what would be the result in a breach of contract suit by Skin?

Five dialysis bags, constructed of a type of membrane that is permeable to water and impermeable to sucrose, were filled with various concentrations of sucrose and then placed in separate beakers containing an initial concentration of 0.6 M sucrose solution. At 10-minute intervals, the bags were massed (weighed), and the percent change in mass of each bag was graphed.  [Line1] represents the bag that contained a solution isotonic to the 0.6 M solution at the beginning of the experiment. [Line2] represents the bag with the highest initial concentration of sucrose. [Line3] represents represents the bag that contains a solution that is hypertonic at 50 minutes. [Line4] represents the bag that contains a solution that is hypotonic at 50 minutes. At 50 minutes, the solution in the bag represented by line E is [tonicity] relative to the surrounding solution.

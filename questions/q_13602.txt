Pygmalion LIZA: Will you drop me altogether now that the experiment is over, Colonel Pickering? I owe so much to you that I should be very 5 unhappy if you forgot me.   PICKERING: It's very kind of you to say so, Miss Doolittle.   LIZA: 10 It's not because you paid for my dresses. I know you are generous to everybody with money. But it was from you that I learned really nice manners; and that is what makes one a lady, isn't it? You see 15 it was so very difficult for me with the example of Professor Higgins always before me. I was brought up to be just like him, unable to control myself, and using bad language on the slightest 20 provocation. And I should never have known that ladies and gentlemen didn't behave like that if you hadn't been there.   HIGGINS: Well!!   25 PICKERING: Oh, that's only his way, you know. He doesn't mean it.   LIZA: Oh, I didn't mean it either, when I was a 30 flower girl. It was only my way. But you see I did it; and that's what makes the difference after all. Do you know what began my real education?   PICKERING: 35 What?   LIZA (stopping her work for a moment): Your calling me Miss Doolittle that day when I first came to Wimpole Street. That was the beginning of self-respect for me. 40 (She resumes her stitching.) And there were a hundred little things you never noticed, because they came naturally to you. Things about standing up and taking off your hat and opening doors--   45 PICKERING: Oh, that was nothing.   LIZA: Yes: things that showed you thought and felt about me as if I were something 50 better than a scullery maid; though of course I know you would have been just the same to a scullery maid if she had been let into the drawing room. You never took off your boots in the dining 55 room when I was there.   PICKERING: You mustn't mind that. Higgins takes off his boots all over the place.   LIZA: 60 I know. I am not blaming him. It is his way, isn't it? But it made such a difference to me that you didn't do it. You see, really and truly, apart from the things anyone can pick up (the dressing 65 and the proper way of speaking, and so on), the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves, but how she's treated. I shall always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins, because 70 he always treats me as a flower girl, and always will; but I know I can be a lady to you, because you always treat me as a lady, and always will.   PICKERING: 75 Well, this is really very nice of you, Miss Doolittle.   LIZA: I should like you to call me Eliza, now, if you would.   80 PICKERING: Thank you. Eliza, of course.   LIZA: And I should like Professor Higgins to call me Miss Doolittle.   Adapted from Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw.

(behind the forehead), which is responsible primarilyfor thinking, planning, memory, and judgment

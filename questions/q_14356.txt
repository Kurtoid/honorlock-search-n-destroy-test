Design the Thevenin Equivalent circuit for the complex circuit shown below.  The equivalent circuit should be created for the load resistor shown, R_L.  Your answer must correctly demonstrate each step of the process for designing a Thevenin equivalent circuit.  To complete this problem:  You may use scratch paper if you like, but all of your work, including all calculations, must be typed into the answer box below.    Your steps should be clearly labeled, and thoroughly explain what you are trying to calculate - and how. Your final answer should also include a description of what the Thevenin equivalent circuit should look like.  Explain the source, resistance(s), and orientation of the circuit. In other words, explain how you would wire the Thevenin equivalent circuit.   Use the "Insert Math Equation" function.  Answers without an adequate explanation or work/calculations will receive little to no points.

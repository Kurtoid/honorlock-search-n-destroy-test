Many (but not all) questions in this exam will revolve around the following scenario.  Please read it carefully.    The sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna) is an important species of Everglades fish. Mollies are euryhaline, meaning they can move freely throughout life between saltwater and freshwater (which allows them to dwell in all parts of the Everglades). The diet of mollies is mainly algae though they will also consume small invertebrates, including insect larvae like those of mosquitoes. In the Everglades food web, mollies are eaten by many other animals  including alligators (reptiles), snowy egrets (birds), raccoons (mammals), giant water bugs (insects), and bullfrogs (amphibians).

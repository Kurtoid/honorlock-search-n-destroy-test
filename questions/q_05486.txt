Dr. Mann Use the following patient case and PN order details to answer the following question.  DJ is status post MVA (motor vehicle accident) with a left femur fracture, right tibia/fib fracture, and blunt abdominal trauma with subsequent exploratory laparotomy. He has developed postoperative ileus and will be started on TPN, as he is expected to need to remain NPO for at least the next 7 days and will not be able to use an enteral route for feeding during this time.  He is considered to be under metabolic stress, has not had PO intake for 3 days.  A nutritional workup by the registered dietician has determined that this patient is considered to be "nutritionally at risk," so the decision was made by the team to move forward with parenteral nutrition. Other relevant patient factors include: His height is 6 feet tall and his weight is 70 kg.  DJ does not report significant weight loss within the past few months. DJ does not report using alcohol, tobacco, or any other illicit substances. DJ does not have any relevant past medical history and did not take any other medications prior to admission. DJ has been receiving the standard electrolyte protocol in the ICU, and this morning's BMP showed his electrolytes to be within normal limits.  He is considered hemodynamically stable The medical resident puts in an initial order for parenteral nutrition (PN) with a note on the order for "pharmacy to adjust dextrose to recommended calorie targets."  Initial Order for the 24-hour PN bag contains:                Dextrose 50%                                                                            450gm (900mL) Amino acids 10%                                                                       110gm (1100mL) Fat emulsion 20% (this product supplies 2kcal/mL)                     250 mL Electrolytes, micronutrients, fluids                                             According to standard ranges   *Note, the dietician suggest to target a fat content between 20 - 35% of total calories to start, and protein within 10 - 35% of total calories to start.  These amounts may be adjusted according to response in the coming days.  Based on this patient's estimated energy requirements (ie: only caloric content from macronutrients), is this order/formulation appropriate?  Why or why not and how would you adjust it?  Use the "AR" format from an SBAR to answer here.  You do NOT need to list or show me all of your calculations.  LIMIT YOUR ANSWER TO 300 words or less (the answer field has a word count in it).   Hints: Focus on changing the dextrose component to meet your target(s), while keeping the other 2 components the same.  Do not try to comment on the electrolytes/additives, fluid amount, or osmolarity here - assume these will all be added according to usual targets and are appropriate.  Just focus on the calorie content from macronutrients to answer this particular question.  Nitrogen content: 1gm nitrogen per 6.25gm protein.     A:   B:

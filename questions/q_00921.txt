Consider the following function designed to be a global linked list of struct CourseNode nodes:void free_list() { struct CourseNode* temp = (struct CourseNode*)malloc(sizeof(struct CourseNode)); while(course_collection != NULL) { temp = course_collection; course_collection = course_collection->next; free(temp); }}Will using this function result in any memory leaks in the program? Assume no leaks occur in any other part of the program and that CourseNode does not contain any pointers.

The employee had access to 9 small plots of land.  Because soil fertility might vary from plot to plot, he divided each plot in half and planted regular seed in one half and kiln-dried seed in the other (randomly deciding which kind of seed was planted in each half plot).

[design] The appropriate hypothesis test was performed on the above data and resulted in a p-value of 0.0704.  Using the 0.05 level of significance, the correct conclusion is [conclusion].

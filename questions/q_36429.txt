Endocrine and Sex Hormone Hybrids: In order to release the thyroid hormones first the [26](26: gland) must release [27](27: hormone) which causes the[28](28: gland) to release [29](29: hormone) which stimulates the thyroid to release T3and T4.   In order to release cortisol first the [30](30: gland) must release a hormone which causes the [32](32: gland) to release [33](33: hormone) which stimulates the adrenal gland to release cortisol.   In the menstrual cycle ovulation occurs on day [34] (34: put the number in), in this phase [35](35: hormone) levels being released from the follicle get so high that they cause [36](36: Y or Z) feedback to the anterior pituitary gland for the release of [37](37: hormone), this hormone leads to rupture of the follicle and release of the egg. Finally the last stage is called the secretory stage and is characterized by the [38](38) releasing [39](39: hormone) which is responsible for maintaining the [40](40) to prepare for implantation in case fertilization occurred. If fertilization and pregnancy do occur the fetus side of the placenta called: [41] (41), will start releasing a hormone that is responsible for keeping the corpus luteum and endometrium alive and is what is tested for in pregnancy tests that hormone is called: [42] (42).

8.3 (3 Points) We assume that a file system makes use of the counting approach to managing free blocks in a file system. In this approach, each entry in the counting table stores two items, namely, (1) the address of the first free disk block and (2) the number n of free contiguous disk blocks that follow the first block. Two bytes in each entry are allocated to store the first item (i.e., address of the first free disk block). Initially, the file system has 512 GB free space, where the block size is configured to 64 MB. Suppose there are 4096 entries in the counting table. What's the size (in terms of KB) of this counting table?

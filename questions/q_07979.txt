Most of you came here with some pretty strong opinions about what literature is, what it can or even should be. You may not have even been aware of having these ideas. They were not necessarily ideas you had formed, but principles extrapolated from things you had either observed or been told. Some of these ideas may have been pretty straightforward, with an apparent (if misguided) moral basis. Think of "profanity has no place in literature." Seems reasonable enough. Maybe it's connected to this idea that literature should be beautiful or something, and that profanity's ugly, or maybe it means literature should be moral, and profanity's immoral, so it can't be literature, or maybe it has something to do with education, like if the writer can't think of a classier word then maybe he or she is not a very talented writer. Turns out all of this is nonsense. Sometimes, as we learned from Etheridge Knight, "fuck" is not an inappropriate word but rather the only appropriate word, and a lot of the reason why certain parties would like for you to believe otherwise has to do with them not wanting you to understand where a writer like Knight is coming from and what he's trying to say and why profanity's the right way to say it. Or let's say you didn't have a problem with Knight's language, but you didn't think literature could be so political. Let's say you didn't think graphic depictions of lesbian sex belonged in literature. Let's say you thought the sentences were supposed to be make sense. Well, both of those ideas have been out of date since 1914, and so on. Let's say you thought Ernest Hemingway was the great American patriotic sportsman and now you're confronted with an antiwar atheist. Let's say you thought Anne Sexton ruined the fairy tales. That makes you Glen Matlock, by the way. He's the guy who got thrown out of the Sext Pistols for complaining when they changed the words to "Johnny B. Good." "But you can't," he said. "It's a classic." Goodbye Glen Matlock. Hello Sid Vicious. What's that you say? Great literature has to be original. It can't be in translation? Allow me to introduce Mr. Ezra Pound, the inventor of Modern poetry in the English language as you understand it. You can see what I'm getting at here.  Put it like this: Which of these writers and works was most difficult for you to accept under the umbrella of literature? What were the gaps in your background and the deficiencies in your education that made it difficult for you. Note that this isn't your opportunity to stick to your guns, critique the materials, critique us, et cetera. You're being asked a question about yourself, which I want you to answer in the most sincere, soul-searching, and self-effacing manner possible. It is possible to learn. It is good to learn. Which one of these things threw you for a loop the most, and how did you resolve it, and how is your understanding of what literature is or can be different now? How are you going to make sure you're not Glen Matlock the next time we go round the prickly pear? You should be detailed here. Tell me which lines surprised you--which scenes, which quotes, which ideas.  Tell me how the boundaries of literature were pushed for you. It doesn't have to be a bad experience, though it can be difficult. And it doesn't have to mean something bad about you, either. Look, there are all kinds of words and ideas and subjects your humble professor doesn't want anywhere near his dinner table. Just remember that, with very few exceptions, a book is not a dinner table. Give me a good length essay for this one. Be thorough. Be authentic. Try to say something real. Keep your eyes on the book and on yourself. Those are your subjects. The book and the self. What did you learn? How do you incorporate this new information into a revised view of what literature is and what it means in the world? Call it 500 words or so. Go.

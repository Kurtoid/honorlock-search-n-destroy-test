Organisms that belong to the genus Ancylostoma and the genus Necator multicellular nucleated organisms that cause similar disease, albeit in different geographic regions. The adult form of these closely related organisms attach themselves to the intestinal wall and feed on blood, which can result in anemia, fatigue, malnutrition for all patients, and problems with growth and mental development in children. Microscopic observation of the egg form of this parasite, shown below at 400x magnification, exits the host in feces and is used to diagnose infection. This organisms is transmitted to new hosts after the eggs hatch in soil and larvae penetrate the skin of a new host. Ancylostoma and Necator belong to which group of microorganisms?

Congratulations, you successfully identified the Epo Receptor from erythroid progenitor cells (Pre-RBCs). However, you have just learned that Epo can also stimulate a newly discovered liver cell type, HepaD cells, to make excess hemoglobin and it seems to use a different receptor. Explain one way to successfully identify and clone the DNA of this different Epo receptor on HepaD cells.

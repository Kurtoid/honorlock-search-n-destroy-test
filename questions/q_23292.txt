Your local swimming pool has an Olympic-sized pool that holds 600,000 gallons of water. Suppose the pool is half full of pure water and we pour, at a rate of 8 gal/s, a chlorine mixture into the pool that contains 4 g/gal of chlorine. We may also assume that the pool is well-mixed and that that this well-mixed solution gets filtered out of the pool at a rate of 8 gal/s. a. (1 point) What is the differential equation that models the rate of change of the concentration of chlorine in the pool? b. (4 points) What is the concentration of chlorine in the pool at time t? c. (2 points) What is the amount of chlorine in the pool at time t? d. (1 point) How much chlorine is in the pool after a long time? e.

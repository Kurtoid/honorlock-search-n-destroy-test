A variety of photosynthetic pigments exist; they are specifically adapted for absorbing different ranges of the visible light spectrum and reflecting others. The absorption spectrum of chlorophyll and accessory pigments can be obtained through spectrophotometry and later used to gain insight into plant growth, determine the abundance of photosynthetic organisms in fresh- or saltwater, and evaluate water quality.

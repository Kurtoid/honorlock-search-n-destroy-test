Find the current through R1 using superposition.  Your final answer should include a magnitude and direction.  A positive current flows DOWN, or RIGHT.  A negative current flows UP, or LEFT. Your work, including all calculations, must be typed into the answer box below.   Use the "Insert Math Equation" function.  Answers without an adequate explanation or work/calculations will receive little to no points.    It is required to organize your work clearly.  Label each step you are taking.  Each step should begin with the source that is included, while other sources are shorted/opened.   Next, indicate the total resistance for this modified circuit, with only one source included.  Finally, use the tools  discussed in lecture to find the specified current.

8. The Hi Tech Company is making three models of computer desks: an executive model, an office model, and a student model.  Construction of the executive model requires 2 hours in the cabinet shop, 1 hour in the finishing department, and 1 hour in the crating department.  The office model requires 1 hour, 2 hours, and 1 hour respectively, in these departments, while the student model requires 1 hour, 1 hour, and  1/2  hour, respectively, in these departments.  On a daily basis, the cabinet shop has 16 hours available; the finishing department, 16; and the crating department, 10.  If the company realizes a profit of $150 on each executive model, $125 on each office model, and $50 on each student model, how many of each type of computer desk should it make and sell to maximize profits?

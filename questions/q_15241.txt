Problem statement: DATASET: bnknew.csv   Our goal is to determine whether a particular individual is eligible to become a borrower at the bank.  The last field i.e., lend is the outcome/dependent variable/variable of interest. The bank is trying to device a Business Analytics technique (model) to answer whether "To Lend or NOT?" given the dataset. The other variables can be used as independent variables, and their labels are given below.     RowNo   Unique ID For each person     age   age of person     job   job of person     marital   marital status of person     default   whether the person has defaulted earlier or not     housing   whether housing is present or not     duration   duration of employment     advertisement_campaign   whether the person was a target to an advertisement campaign     pdays   the number of productive days     previous_work   the prior work experience      employee_variable_rate   the variable rate offered to the person     consumer_index   the person consumer index     consumer_confidence   the person's consumer confidence value     interest   the interest rate on the person's stock     nr_employed   the number of people employed     lend   whether the person is a lendable candidate or not     Directions: Answer the following questions in as much detail as possible. Answer each question separately.   Attach your corresponding source code (either in text or as screenshot to the word document). Clues: Use the procedure for machine learning i.e., Loading Data, Cleaning data, Running the Model and Interpretation of the Results with Prediction. While loading data and cleaning data if you run into errors, please reduce the dataset size by eliminating variables. Make sure that you understand when factor variables are used vs. when continuous variables are used. Business Analytics is about understanding the key variables and using them in a mathematically sound way, to answer a business problem - such as "given the information we know, should we lend to this person or not?" Question 1. Model - 20 points (a) Please write down the mathematical notation (form) of the model for analyzing the dataset. (b) Describe the dependent and independent variable(s), and for each variable state the  reason you chose it. (20 points) Question 2.  Execution of model on Train Dataset - 20 points (a)split the dataset into training dataset and test dataset in the ratio of 80:20.  For example, if your dataset has 100 rows, 80 rows will go to your training dataset, and you will train your model on that. You will use the remaining 20 rows to test your model. (b) Run (execute) your model in "R-studio" on the training dataset. Display the results. Question 3. Interpretation - 10 points (a) What variables cause the firm to lend data. (Please explain using the context of your R-code and results you obtained as a response to Question 2) Question 4. Prediction - 10 points (a) Using the test dataset, run your prediction. Display the results of your prediction command. (b) How accurate is your model - provide a measurement of accuracy? Question 5. Post-Prediction - 10 (a) How can you improve the accuracy of your prediction?  Can you try to improve the accuracy of your prediction and present the results of your attempt below? Question 6. Answer the following questions. - 30 points  a)  What is a panel regression and What are the two types of panel regressions we learned during class? b) What is a choice model and Explain the uses of a choice model with at least 1 example? c) What is a probit regression and how does it differ from the logit regression?

Consider problem 4 from Exam 2: An automated repair center needs to complete 100 maintenance jobs in the next three days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday), of which 50 will arrive on Monday morning and 50 on Tuesday morning. Two repair robots are available: regular and advanced. Due to other activities, the number of jobs that each can complete per day varies: regular robot can complete [r1] jobs on Monday, [r2] on Tuesday and [r3] on Wednesday; advanced robot can do 50 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday and 40 on Wednesday. Assigning a job to the regular robot is free, while assigning a job to the advanced robot costs $100 on Monday, $400 on Tuesday and $600 on Wednesday. Additionally, each day that a job is not completed costs $150. The problem is to determine how many jobs each robot performs on each day so that the total cost is minimized. This time, give an LP formulation to solve this problem. Hint: the variables can correspond to the number of jobs arriving on each day, assigned to be completed by each robot on each day in the future. In the field below, type you objective function. On your paper: give the full formulation and explain your variables.

The patient, a 60-year-old male, was taken to the emergency department of a local hospital from a wedding reception after he developed symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain. He also reported that he felt very tired after traveling to this city for the wedding and has learned he cannot tolerate as much walking as he had even one month ago. The patient knew he had lung cancer. The ER physician contacted his family physician, who told him the patient had small cell carcinoma of the left upper lobe of the lung, diagnosed 14 months ago, and he had been followed for possible malignant pleural effusion that resolved without treatment three months ago. The patient was admitted to the hospital and examined by an oncologist and cardiologist. After several tests were performed, it was determined the patient had exudative pleural effusion, which the oncologist referred to as "malignant pleural effusion of the left lung." The cardiologist performed a therapeutic thoracentesis on the left side that provided immediate relief. However, the relief was short lived and the fluid re-accumulated. A second procedure was then performed. The patient came to the OR and was placed in a supine position on the table. General anesthesia was administered and video-assistance was used for the procedure. The right lateral decubitus position was utilized as the sterile prepping and draping of the left chest was done. Local anesthetic of the skin overlying the sixth rib was injected, and an incision was made. Subcutaneous dissection was performed. Dissection over the left pleural space continued with a curved hemostat until I entered the pleural space. Thoracostomy dilation was achieved and l000 mL of pleural effusion drained by suction. Once most of the fluid had been drained, I inserted a 0 degree thorascope and was able to drain a little pocket of effusion from the costophrenic recess. The thorascope was then used to instill talc, 4 grams which bad been aerosolized covering both the pleura and the lung. Instruments were removed. Anesthesia was reversed, the patient extubated, and sent to the PACU in stable condition. All counts were correct at the end of the procedure with very minimal blood loss during the procedure. The patient rested in the hospital for one more day and was discharged to the care of his family. The physicians advised the patient to rest at least two more days in this city before driving 250 miles with his family back to his hometown. Records were given to the patient to take to his oncologist at home.

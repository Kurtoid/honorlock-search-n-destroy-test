A(n) __________ is a brief story with a point, often based on personal experience.
The Orphan Hermit was startled one day last week when hundreds of people carrying cameras, lights, and props invaded the Ocala National Forest near his wilderness home.  He was ready to flee deeper into the woods (after all, he is a hermit!) when he saw one of his favorite actors, William Petersen, amongst the crowd.  They were shooting the premiere episode of the rebooted "CSI: Vegas" show on location, right in his very own forest!  Wow! Orphy went over and introduced himself to CBS president Kelly Kahl, who was making a special visit to the set.  Kelly told Orphy they the premiere episode of the reboot was inspired by two murder victims discovered back in January 2006 at Hidden Pond, in the Ocala National Forest near Orphy's home (to be transposed for the show to the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area in Nevada). Orphy told Kelly that he followed the original case quite closely, since he had been fascinated with forensic chemistry ever since attending a guest lecture in CHM 2051 a few years before.  The director was excited to have a local hermit (and forensic chemist!) to advise them, and even offered him a role as an extra in the show! William Petersen asked Orphy whether the bones would ever dissolve in the dry, sandy ground of the high "pine hammock" area of the forest. He figured that in such a rural area of Florida, there wouldn't be acid rain, and that the bones would never dissolve given that the rainwater would have a pH of 7.0.  Orphy informed him that even the pristine rain in the wilderness would be acidic!  Why would the rain be acidic?

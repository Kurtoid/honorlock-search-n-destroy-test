On June 1, a general contractor and a subcontractor entered into a contract under which the subcontractor agreed to deliver all of the steel joists that the general contractor required in the construction of a hospital building. The contract provided that delivery of the steel joists would begin on September 1. Although the general contractor had no reason to doubt the subcontractor's ability to perform, the general contractor wanted to be sure that the subcontractor was on track for delivery in September. He therefore wrote a letter on July 1 to the subcontractor demanding that the subcontractor provide assurance of its ability to meet the September 1 deadline. The subcontractor refused to provide such assurance. The general contractor then immediately obtained the steel joists from another supplier. If the subcontractor sues the general contractor for breach of contract, is the subcontractor likely to prevail?
A valid repeated measures ANOVA (rANOVA) was conducted to study the relative effectiveness of three teaching methods used to help third grade students remember vocabulary words. The teaching methods were using flashcards (Method1), completing a worksheet (Method2), and watching an instructional video (Method3). Twenty students were selected, and each student took turns using each one of the three methods to help learn a set of vocabulary words (a Latin square design was used). After a student used an assigned method, he or she took a test over that particular set of vocabulary words. SPSS was used to conduct a repeated measures ANOVA to analyze the vocabulary test scores, and a portion of the SPSS output is provided in the following tables. Refer to the tables as needed to complete this problem. Table 3A    Table 3B    Table 3C    Do the following:  Discuss the result of Mauchly's Test of Sphericity and the implication for the repeated measures ANOVA. State the null and alternative hypotheses for the repeated measures ANOVA test, make a decision about the null hypothesis, and write a conclusion statement. If appropriate, use the Bonferroni post hoc analysis to identify all pairs of treatment means that are statistically significantly different. Justify your conclusions.

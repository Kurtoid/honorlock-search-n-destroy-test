The group believes that the Tigereye has too little debt and can create additional value from additional interest tax shields. Tigereye is going have a cash flow from assets of $[CFA] million each of the next 3 years and those cash flows will grow a [G] percent per year every year thereafter. Tigereye's tax rate is 20 percent and their current (unlevered) cost of capital is [R0] percent.  As part of the LBO, the management group will borrow an amount to complete the deal and then transfer it to the firm. This debt has an interest rate equal to Tigereye's cost of debt of [Rb] percent. The LBO group will maintain this level of debt for three years and then allow it to grow with the firm's cash flows at a rate of [G] percent. They will borrow an amount such that the firm will maintain a target debt-equity ratio of 1.00 indefinitely after three years. The group views this debt-equity ratio as optimal for maximizing the value of the firm. Assuming no bankruptcy costs, what is the Year 3 terminal value of the interest rate tax shields from the LBO plan? (Enter your answer in millions of dollars rounded to the fourth decimal point.

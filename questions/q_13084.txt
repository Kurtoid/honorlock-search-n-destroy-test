Scientists in Germany recently discovered a species of bacteria that can metabolize (break down) a type of plastic called polyurethane (chemical formula: C3H8N2O). This is exciting because these bacteria may one day be used to perform large scale removal of polyurethane, an environmental pollutant, from various waste sites. Just as exciting was the discovery that this same bacterial species can also metabolize 2,4-diaminotoluene (chemical formula: C7H10N2), which is a toxic compound that is potentially released when polyurethane is broken down naturally. Having these abilities means that these bacteria may one day be used to perform "complete cleaning" of plastics by not only breaking down the plastic itself, but also the toxic byproducts that might result from plastic breakdown. This species of bacteria was shown to use 2,4-diaminotoluene as a source of energy, carbon, and nitrogen. Question: Based solely on the information provided above, you can deduce that the recently discovered bacterial species is a(n)...select all that apply

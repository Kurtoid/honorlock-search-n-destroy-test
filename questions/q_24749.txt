During our last class discussion class, we discussed the significance of John Snow's discovery in greater detail. John Snow is considered one of the fathers of modern epidemiology because of his actions during London's Cholera events from 1849-1953 demonstrate epidemiology practices and how to control a disease. Five-part question.   (Please number your responses) 1. Explain how the Southwark and Vauxhall Company and the Lambeth Company that drew water from the Thames River provided John Snow with a kind of natural experiment. 2. As discussed, how did this reduce bias, or systematic error?  Think about the two groups. 3. The rate of cholera deaths was 8.5 times higher in homes supplied by Southwark and Vauxhall Company than in those supplied by the Lambeth Company. I explained how this incident rate was calculated. The ratio of the incident rate for persons exposed (315 deaths from Cholera per 10,000 homes) to the factor to the incidence rate for persons in the unexposed group (37 deaths from Cholera per 10,000 homes).  This ratio is called the _______________________________? 4. In our example, a RR of 8.5 was fairly significant.  Explain what a RR of 1.0 means in terms of the association between the exposed and the unexposed.  RR of 1.0 means ____________________________________ ?   5. A value greater than 1.0 means _____________________?  A value less than 1.0 means ____________________?

She is hopeful the relationship will become serious and anticipates potentially having a sexual relationship with this person.  She has 3 teenage children (whom she has full custody of) and works full time.  Her menstrual cycles have become somewhat irregular and heavier than in the past.  The bleeding patterns are "annoying"  to her.  She also describes occasional hot flashes, one of which occurred while she was on a date.  This caused embarrassment.

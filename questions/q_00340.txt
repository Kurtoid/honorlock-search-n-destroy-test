WORKOUT PROBLEM starts here: (Nothing to submit here, just read the problem. Some of the homework format/layout is already provided)    Two blocks connected by a rope passing over an ideal pulley rest on frictionless ramps. Ignore air resistance. Block 1 has a mass of 100 kg and block 2 has a mass of 50.0 kg. The angles are th = 30.0deg and a = 53.1deg. The system is released from rest.    Given: Connected blocks on frictionless ramps.Find:  Draw a FBD clearly and neatly for block 1. Draw a FBD clearly and neatly for block 2. Determine the accelerations of the blocks. State which way the blocks move and explain why. You must have supporting rational for this answer (no credit will be given for statements such as "Block # moves down the ramp" without justification). Find the tension in the rope.  Figure:

Thermal spray is a high temperature cladding process which deposit and solidify a layer of molten metal on the metallic component.  Figure below shows the process on a stainless steel plate.  The thickness of the plate is 5 cm.  The thermal diffusivity of the plate is a=0.05 cm2/s.  The plate is initially pre-heated uniformly at 200 oC to reduce the thermal stress during the process.  During the spray, you can treat the surface temperature to be a constant temperature of 2000 oC.  1) If considering thermal spray as an unsteady 1D heat transfer, please position your coordinates and the origin in the schematic, write down a simplified energy equation and initial/boundary conditions. (you do not need to solve it) 2) Please determine if the actual process above can be considered as a semi-infinite case at the time of 10 seconds.  Assuming the solution of semi-infinite case is:

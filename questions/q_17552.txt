O(N2) Sort Write the state of the elements in the vector below after each of the first 3 passes of the outermost loop of the selection sort algorithm. vector numbers {63, 9, 45, 72, 27, 18, 54, 36}; selectionSort(numbers); after pass 1: [p1] after pass 2: [p2] after pass 3: [p3]  Merge Sort Trace the complete execution of the merge sort algorithm when called on the vector below, similarly to the example of merge sort shown in the lecture slides. Show the sub-vectors that are created by the algorithm and show the merging of sub-vectors into larger sorted vectors. vector numbers {22, 88, 44, 33, 77, 66, 11, 55}; mergeSort(numbers); Make sure to format your answers with each sub-vectorsurrounded by { } braces, such as {1, 2} {3, 4}. 1st split      [s1] 2nd split     [s2] 3rd split      [s3] 1st merge   [m1] 2nd merge  [m2] 3rd merge   [m3]  Binary Search Suppose we are performing a binary search on a sorted vector called numbers initialized as follows: // index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 vector numbers {-2, 0, 1, 7, 9, 16, 19, 28, 31, 40, 52, 68, 85, 99};   int index = binarySearch(numbers, 5); Write the indexes of the elements that would be examined by the binary search (the mid values in our algorithm's code) and write the value that would be returned from the search. Assume that we are using the binary search algorithm shown in class. indexes examined: [e1] values returned:     [e2]

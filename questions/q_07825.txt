Cerebellum is represented by label  _________.
A specialty clinic treats two types of problems: ankle and foot.  Let A be the event that a patient has an ankle problem and A' be the event a patient has a foot problem.  P(A) = 0.71.  Additionally, let M be the event that a patient is a male and M' be the event the patient is female.  P(M) = [m]. The probability that a randomly selected patient is a male with an ankle problem is [c].  This copywritten question is part of a quiz or exam at Arizona State.  It may not be posted or reproduced without the permission of the author, Dr. L. Chattin, and Arizona State University. Determine the probability that a randomly selected patient is a male or is a patient with an ankle problem.   If your answer is non-integer, express it to three decimal places using conventional rounding methods.

Assume a closed economy, with no government, is characterized by the following production function:     Y = 5(K1/2)(L1/2) The savings rate in this economy is s = .20, the rate at which capital depreciates is  = .10, and there is no population growth (n = 0) or technological growth (g = 0). a) Calculate the steady-state level of capital per actual worker (k*), output per actual worker (y*), consumption per actual worker (c*), and investment per worker (i*). If the current population is equal to L = 20, calculate aggregate output (Y) and the capital stock (K) assuming that we are at the steady-state. b)  What is the golden savings rate (s'golden) and k*golden when n = 0? If the economy were to experience positive population growth (n>0), how would this affect capital per actual worker (k*), output per actual worker (y*), and consumption per actual worker (c*) in the new steady-state relative to your answer in (a)?

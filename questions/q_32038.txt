The nurse is caring for a 40 week gestation patient who had a non-reactive NST in the obstetrician's office. She has come to the labor and delivery unit for a biophysical profile (BPP) and further monitoring.  The mother appears anxious and asks, "Why are they doing this test?  Is something wrong with my baby?"  The nurse's best response is:

The data below displays the results of an experiment in which potatoes were incubated in sucrose solutions of different concentrations and weighed before and after the incubation.       Sample A B C D E   Sucrose Concentration 0% 0.3 M 0.5 M 0.75 M 1 M   Initial weight (grams) 0.9g 1.2g 1.0g 0.95g 1.0g   Final weight (grams) 1.2g 1.4g 1.0g 0.8g 0.75g   Percent weight change 33.3% 16.7% 0% -15.7% -25%    A. Based on the results of the experiment, which of the sucrose solutions listed above (in blue) are hypertonic relative to the solute concentration inside the potato strip? B. Provide a brief explanation of your answer to part A.
Certain exercises, generally those which use short intervals of strong exertion, are such that the body's need for oxygen during cellular respiration exceeds the ability to breath in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide.  This is referred to as anaerobic exercise.    d) Briefly describe the mechanism of fermentation and how this relates to the cell's efforts to continue to make some ATP despite the lack of oxygen.
Timed oral reading tests such as the DIBELS, which measure how many words a student can read in a minute, are blamed mainly for an overemphasis on speed of reading.
A sheet of metal with a length of 1.5 m and width of 2 m is placed on the surface of a wooden table. A 0.0015 m thick dielectric cotton tablecloth with a permittivity of 4.8x10-11 C2/Nm2 is laid on top of the metal sheet and another identical metal plate is placed on the first piece of metal. Each plate is hooked up to opposite terminals of a 12 V car battery.    a) What is the charge that develops on the capacitor plates? b) How much energy is stored by the capacitor? c) Calculate the strength of the electric field between the capacitor plates.   Suddenly a large punch bowl is spilled on the table soaking the tablecloth and changing the permittivity of the cloth to 7.7x10-10 C2/Nm2. Answer the following questions assuming the cloth is soaked as described. d)How much charge is on the plates now. e) Find the energy stored by the capacitor when the tablecloth is soaked. f)Now the metal plates are disconnected from the battery. If the cloth dries overnight returning the tablecloth to its original condition, then calculate the energy stored in the capacitor the next day. g)What is the new potential difference the next day?   part a) Co =1.77x10-8 F 4. Since the capacitor has a dielectric between the plates you must calculate the dielectric constant. Calculate the dielectric constant for the tablecloth. Round to 4 decimal places.

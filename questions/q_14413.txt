What type(s) of rotational symmetry (in 2D) does this object have? i. 1-fold rotational symmetry ii. 2-fold rotational symmetry iii. 4-fold rotational symmetry
An [Operon] is a cluster of related genes controlling sequences that turn the genes on or off.  When lactose is present it interferes with the [Repression] which would bind to the [operator] and physically blocks the attachment of [RNApolymerase1] if lactose wasn't present.  The [operator1] is a DNA segment that acts as a switch that is turned on or off.  [RNApolymerase2] will bind the the [promoter] which is a control sequence where the transcription enzyme initiates transcription.  Genes are transcribed and translation will produce all three lactose enzymes.
Use the following information about tomato inheritance. Assume the genes are not linked.    M = smooth skin                   R = red fruit m = fuzzy skin                        r = yellow fruit   A.  What is the genotype of a homozygous smooth yellow tomato? [genosmoothyellow] B.  What is the genotype of a fuzzy homozygous red tomato? [genofuzzyred] C.  What is the genotype of all the F1 offspring that would be produced by crossing these two tomatoes (A with B)? [F1geno] D.  If a cross occurs between two F1 tomatoes (C), the F2 generation will be produced. This would be an example of a dihybrid cross. What would be the expected phenotypic ratio of that F2 generation? (smooth, red : smooth, yellow : fuzzy, red : fuzzy, yellow) [smred] : [smyel] : [fuzred] : [fuzyel] You do not need to necessarily do a Punnett square.

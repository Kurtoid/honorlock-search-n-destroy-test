Property Management, Inc. (PMI), presents a standard-form lease for an apartment to Quentin, a potential tenant. PMI offers it on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Prior to signing the contract, PMI had told Quentin that the utilities would be included in the rent. The contract clearly does not include anything about PMI paying utilities, and states clearly that the tenant will pay all utilities, and it includes a merger clause stating that only the terms in the contract are those upon which Quentin relied and agreed to when signing the contract. When Quentin finds out the utilities are not included in the rent, he wants to rescind the contract. Is it likely Quentin will be able to succeed in his lawsuit to cancel the contract?

A 45-year-old male presents to the ER complaining on shortness of breath.  The respiratory therapist assessment reveals decreased breath sound to the right lower lobe, a temperature of 101.7 F, HR 118, RR 26 and Sa02 93% on RA.  The respiratory therapist suspects the patient has a small pleural effusion.  What should the therapist recommend?
Assume the ambient temperature is 300 K.  The pieces of a silicon MOS capacitor consists of the following materials along with their parameters listed below: Metal: aluminum (work function = 4.1 eV), Oxide: Zirconium dioxide (dielectric constant =32.6; Electron affinity = 2.0 eV, bandgap energy = 5.7 eV, thickness (tox) = 10 nm)  (FYI, this is the material used as the "high-K dielectric" in advanced CMOS to extended the Moore's law.) Semiconductor: silicon (dielectric constant = 11.9, electron affinity = 4.05 eV, bandgap energy = 1.12 eV, work function = 4.25 eV, ni = 1010 cm -3) Individual section of these three pieces of materials is shown schematically below.   (3points) (a) The threshold voltage is [Vth] V (4 points) (b) Assume the semiconductor is electrically grounded. Determine the gate voltage (VG) when the electron concentration at the oxide-semiconductor interface is equal to the intrinsic carrier concentration (ni).  VG = [fs] V

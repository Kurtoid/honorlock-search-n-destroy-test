A mass m1=2.00 kg undergoes circular motion of radius R=30.0 cm on a horizontal frictionless table, connected by a massless string through a hole in the table to a second mass m2=3.00 kg as shown above. Mass m2 is stationary and friction between m1 and the table is negligible. Assume g=10.0 m/s2. Check all that apply.

James has recently returned from a study abroad experience in the Amazon diagnosed with malaria (a parasitic worm that directly infects the red blood cells).  He is anemic and has an elevated WBC count.  Which of the following white blood cells do you expect to find elevated in the differential WBC count?
Hazel purchased a new business asset (five-year asset) on September 30, 2020, at a cost of $100,000. On October 4, 2020, she placed the asset in service. This was the only asset she placed in service in 2020. Hazel did not elect SS 179 or additional first-year depreciation. On August 20, 2021, Hazel sold the asset. Determine the cost recovery for 2021 for the asset.

Case study #1: A 45 year old man comes to the clinic complaining about pain and numbness to his right lower extremity. The pain and numbness are located along his posterior thigh, posterior and lateral leg, and the lateral side of his foot.  Because this type of pain could result from nerve compression at different locations along the nerve distribution, the next three questions present three different scenarios. Each scenario gives you additional information gathered by further examination, observation and questioning of the patient. Each scenario presents a patient with different symptoms. The goal is to test your ability to discern differential diagnosis.   Scenario # 2: When talking to the patient, you find out that he is a businessman who travels several hundred miles a week in his car. You notice that when he walks, he exhibits a high stepping gait and a sudden lowering of the foot. You also observe no abnormalities when examining the X-ray images of his vertebral column. Based on this scenario, which of the following is the most likely cause of these symptoms?

A 14-year-old girl is seen by her pediatrician with complaints that she exhibits very slow healing of cuts and scrapes, and is small in stature. Your laboratory has ruled out any inborn error of metabolism and possible cancer. A deficiency of what trace element might be responsible for the stated symptoms?
A researcher studies how a beam of small light nuclei (z=2), with 1.5 MeV of energy, is scattered by the Coulomb interaction from a thin foil of lead (Pb, Z=82).  When the detector is placed at a scattering angle of [theta1] degrees, the experimenter measures [N1] alpha particles per minute.     The experimenter moves the particle detector to a new position at angle [theta2] degrees.  At this new angle the number of particles per minute is expected to be

C Conservation of energy, non-conservative force acting (Isolated system) A 1.5-kg block sliding on a rough horizontal surface is attached to one end of a horizontal spring (k = 200 N/m) which has its other end fixed. If this system is displaced 30 cm horizontally from the equilibrium position and released from rest, the block first reaches the equilibrium position with a speed of 3.0 m/s. What is the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the horizontal surface on which it slides?
Solve the system.-8x + 3y + 9z = 1302x + 6y - 9z = -467x - 4y + 4z = -48 x=[x]; y=[y]; z=[z]

The results are as follows: NOTE: bar X is the sample mean                                     bar X1=131, bar X2=120, n1=100, n2=100, s1=27 and s2=27   Analyze this data to determine if the treatment has a significant effect. That is the treatment given to group 2 is associated with a significant reduction in blood Pressure.

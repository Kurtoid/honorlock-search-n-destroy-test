Death Valley holds the record for the hottest place on earth. The hottest air temperature ever recorded in Death Valley was 134degF (57degC) on July 10, 1913. Earlier that year, on January 8, 2013, Death Valley experienced a record low temperature of 15degF (-10degC). Suppose that these two extreme temperatures had occurred on the same day, and the gauge pressure in each of your car's tires was 2.50 x 105 N/m2 at a temperature of -10.0degC before sunrise. What is their gauge pressure later in the afternoon, when their temperature has reached -57.0degC (assume there are no leaks in the tire, and no noticeable change in the volume)?

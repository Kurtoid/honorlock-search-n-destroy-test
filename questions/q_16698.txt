Integrative A 4 People with agoraphobia are so filled with anxiety about being in public places that they seldom leave their homes.  Knowing this is a difficult disorder to treat, a researcher tries a long-term treatment.  A sample of individuals reports how often they have ventured out of the house in the past month.  Then they receive relaxation training and are introduced to trips away from the house at gradually increasing durations.  After two months of treatment, participants report the number of trips out of the house they made in the last 30 days.

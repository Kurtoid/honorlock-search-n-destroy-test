The manufacturer alleges that the parties had negotiated a possible sale but never reached an agreement. The manufacturer thus denies the existence of a contract. The pharmacy chain spent considerable time and money retrieving emails from its server between it and the manufacturer about the alleged contract.

Use the equations below to solve the following gas law problem.  P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr 2.60 liters of oxygen gas is produced at 0.25 atm of pressure. It is to be compressed and stored in a 200 mL cylinder.  If the temperature is constant, calculate the pressure, in mm Hg, of the oxygen in the cylinder.   To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem.  Be sure to include the answer. Show your work (equation/and units) by using the equation editor() in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use   to insert ratios.  Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

You are a homecare nurse caring for An Older Woman with a Chronic Cardiac Condition Francis R., a 79-year-old woman, was admitted to a home care agency because of heart failure. She was hospitalized twice in the last six months for a toxic level of Lanoxin (digitalis) and an exacerbation of heart failure; she is no longer on Lanoxin. Francis lived in her small two-story home for many years. She received social security payments and some retirement income. Her daughters lived far away. She had a friend who drove her to appointments, purchased her medications, and took her to church regularly. Francis told the nurse that while she misses her husband and feels lonely at times. The home care nurse and Francis discussed heart failure and how she could manage the symptoms more effectively. Francis was very receptive to weighing herself daily, keeping a symptom diary and calling her providers when appropriate, using energy conservation techniques, elevating her legs regularly, and using an extra pillow to elevate her head and shoulders to decrease dyspnea while sleeping. She agreed to schedule the amount and time of her fluid intake based on the nurse's recommendations. She was pleased that the nurse arranged for the delivery of mobile meals that were high in iron, and would receive those meals beginning the next day. Francis and the nurse discussed her medications. The home care nurse described the benefits of using a medication reminder/organizer system; Francis was pleased that the nurse planned to bring a system later that week. Francis agreed to record notes about her medications, their actions, and their side effects in her symptom diary.

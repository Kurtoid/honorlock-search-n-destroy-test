Refusal to Pay. Business law professor Debby needed some yard work done. She told her class that she would give $50 to the first person who mowed her yard. She also entered into an agreement with Brenda to trim some shrubbery for $40. Max went to mow Debby's yard. Unfortunately, just as he finished mowing, a neighborhood dog bit him and he had to go to the emergency room for a couple of stitches. Debby refused to pay Max on the basis that the agreement was not in writing and that Max ended up being more trouble than he was worth. Max refused to pay the emergency room because he said that they did not have a binding, bilateral contract. Brenda refused to trim the shrubbery because she got a better offer and claimed that she was not bound by the contract until she started to perform. Which of the following is true regarding Max's statement that he did not have to pay the emergency room charges?

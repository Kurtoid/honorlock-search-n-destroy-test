PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Irrigation and debridement of the left lower extremity ofthe medial and lateral wounds, both greater than 10 cm each. ANESTHESIA TYPE: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: The patient is a 59-year-old male with the above diagnosis.

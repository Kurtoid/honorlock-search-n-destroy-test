Refer to the previous question on Airbus.   If Airbus decides to hedge using put options on U.S. dollars, what would be the 'expected' euro proceeds from the American sale? Assume that Airbus regards the current forward exchange rate as an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Answer in Euros to two decimal places and do not use a currency symbol.   Hint: When calculating the euro proceeds (aka "net payoff" or "profit") from the hedged aircraft sale, first think about the exchange rate at which the firm will convert dollars into euros, which will give you the payoff in euros in six months. Then, calculate the future value of the option premium in euros. Then, subtract the future value of the option premium from the euro payoff. Hint 2: Assume that interest is calculated using linear compounding.

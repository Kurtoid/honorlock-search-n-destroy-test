Imagine that you are designing a study on career decision self-efficacy among Asian international students. One instrument that has been used to assess career decision self-efficacy is the Career Indecision Profile (CIP; Brown et al., 2012). This instrument has been used with different samples of U.S. population but there is no evidence to support its utility with Asian international students. Literature suggests that evidence for sources of bias in instruments can be found in the (a) content of instruments, (b) internal structures of instruments, and (c) relationships between scores on the instruments and scores on other similar measures.    Describe evidence relevant to each of the three sources of bias. Define the purpose of measurement invariance research and discuss how measurement invariance research can be used to investigate one of the sources of biases.

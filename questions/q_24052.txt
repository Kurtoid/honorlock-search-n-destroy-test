The following three questions relate to this information. New, Inc. has bonds outstanding that mature in 15 years and pay a 6% coupon rate annually. You looked up the price of New bonds and they currently sell for $1,200. Your required rate of return is 5.5%. Calculate the bond's expected rate of return. This is based on the current market price of the bonds. Do not round and use a decimal (use at least 3 decimal places like this: 0.111).

Scenario: You are counseling a 54-year-old woman. Taking her history, you find out that she lives with a partner and works at a sedentary job. Her last physical indicated normal labs, normal vitals and a BMI of 26. She reports that she has been noticing menstrual and body changes, especially in the abdominal area. She is worried that she is having body changes because she is doing something wrong. She tells you that she enjoys walks outside with her dog and partner. Her goal is to go to spinning classes at the gym three times a week but that she is not consistent. She is attentive to get enough sleep and you assess her to be drinking enough water. She says that stress can sometimes affect the amount and type of foods she eats.   Write one specific behavior change you would want for this client.

List the following colors of visible light from lowest frequency to highest frequency: green, blue, yellow, red, violet.
Write a JavaFX GUI program with file name LastnameFirstnameExam5.java that meets the following requirements and adheres to the layout included sketch.  Must set the title of the window to be "1331 Exam 5 - YOURNAME", where YOURNAME is replaced with your first and last name. Must include some non-editable text at the top to the window (not the title) with a short phrase of your choosing. Change the text font to either Georgia, Papyrus, Courier New, or Comic Sans MS; it cannot be the default font. Font size should be 12. Must include a plain Button.  The button must toggle the color of the short phrase between Color.BLACK and your favorite color.  Make sure this color is still visible in the UI (i.e. the color should be dark enough to be seen). You must set the button text to something of your choosing.   Must use the provided image below. We recommend that you use an ImageView to display the image.     WARNING: We will be compiling this from the command line with the image file in the same directory as the source code. If you choose to use an IDE during development, make sure that you place the image in whatever directory will allow it to load by only specifying the filename without any path information. (i.e. you should open the file as "filename.png", not "..filename.png", "/Users/Pictures/filename.png", etc.)   Must include a select one-of-many toggle group to control the alignment of the image displayed. There should be 3 alignment options for Top, Center, and Bottom.  Hint: StackPane has a setAlignment method. You may place this group beside or below the image.  In order to actually see the alignment change you will need to ensure that your window/stage is large enough. So, you need to set the size of your stage to be large enough to see the change proportional to the the size of your image. A good ratio is to make the window 3 times the width and height of the Image. To do this you can use the following methods: stage.setMinWidth(X); and stage.setMinHeight(Y);   Must use a Slider UI control that will control the scale of the image.  The Slider's major tick labels should be displayed (setShowTickLabels)   The Slider should have a minimum value of 0.1, maximum value of 2.0, initial value of 1.0, and a step amount (i.e. amount to step by) of 0.1 Hint: Make sure to set the scale of both the X and Y dimensions using setScaleX and setScaleY Another Hint: Look closely at Slider's constructors to find one that allows for configuration of the min/max/init values on creation of the Slider to make your life easier. Yet Another Hint: There are several ways to implement the event handling, we recommend using the setOnMouseReleased method that is available to any Node   You must use at least one of the following children of Pane to control the layout of the Nodes: BorderPane, GridPane, HBox, or VBox. You must implement your event handling at least two of the three ways we taught: named inner class, anonymous inner class, and lambda expression.  For example, at least one handler as an anonymous inner class and at least one handler as a lambda expression. Failure to implement handlers in two different ways will result in the loss of points.   Points may be deducted if your layout deviates greatly from the one shown below. However, you do not need to have a border around the pane containing your image nor around the image itself. You may place the one-of-many toggle group below or beside the Image.  YOUR SHOULD ONLY SUBMIT A SINGLE JAVA FILE. ENSURE THAT ANY OTHER CLASSES YOU INCLUDE EXIST WITHIN THE SAME FILE. IF YOUR SUBMITTED CODE DOES NOT COMPILE, YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO. SAVE, BACKUP, AND TEST OFTEN! The following is an example layout for your UI, but as long as you meet the requirements stated above the layout is flexible:
How should the nurse respond to a family immediately after a patient dies?

A nurse is caring for a 4-year-old child who developed acute renal failure after a traumatic injury with hemorrhaging. Place the following events below in order in which they most likely occurred during progression of the severe renal deterioration. All options must be used.     1.    Acidosis     2.    Severe hypocalcemia     3.    Azotemia     4.    Oliguria
Which of the following programming techniques can stop buffer overflow attacks?
Which of the following membrane protein is paired correctly with its function:
Drink d1 = new Matcha(); Drink d2 = new Lemonade(); Matcha mat = new Matcha(); Lemonade lemon = new Lemonade();  For the class hierarchy and declarations above, correctly indicate whether each of the following statements will compile and what will happen at runtime (runs correctly or runtime exception). It may be helpful to use scratch paper to keep track of each variable's static and dynamic type.  1   Matcha m1 = (Matcha) lemon; 2   Matcha m2 = (Matcha) d1; 3   Matcha m3 = (Matcha) d2; 4   Drink drink = (Drink) mat;   1   : [1]  2   : [2]  3   : [3]  4   : [4]

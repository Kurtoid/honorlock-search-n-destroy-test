Refer to Figure D, which gives the marginal cost of pollution clean-up for a four-firm economy. So for example, for Firm A to reduce pollution by the first unit would require it spends $50, for the second unit $100, the third $150, and for the fourth unit it would require $250 and that it had already reduced pollution by the first three units (spending $300 to clean up the first three units).  If the government reduced pollution by 8 units by selling pollution permits, how much would it cost in clean-up to reduce pollution by 8 units? Hint: find the cost of reducing the cheapest 8 units.

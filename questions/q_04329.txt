Read the following information about the application of colligative properties and then use this information to solve problems 1 - 5. At higher elevation, the boiling point of water is lower than at sea level.  This difference in temperature can affect how food is prepared.  The boiling point of water in Denver, Colorado is approximately 202 degF (94.4 degC).  This means that food cooked at this higher elevation may not be "done" in the same time as you would expect from experience cooking food in Florida.  This is because less heat is being applied to the food.  You decide, based on your knowledge of colligative properties that adding salt (NaCl) to a pot of boiling water to raise its boiling point would be a good way to combat this.

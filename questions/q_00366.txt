The stop-and-wait protocol is used for flow control over a link that is 2km long, with 10Mbps capacity, and 10% packet error rate. Packet length is 1000bits. The utilization of this network is [x1]. Assume the capacity is increased from 10Mbps to 100Mbps (with everything else being the same), the new utilization is [x2]. Suggest 3 ways to bring the utilization close to what it was with the 10Mbps: 1- Increase the [x3] by a factor of [x4], 2- Decrease the [x5] by a factor of [x6], or 3- use a window-based mechanism with a window of [x7].

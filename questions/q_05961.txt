1.Your express package courier company needs to determine where to locate drop boxes for customers.  The city has been divided into the five zones (A-E).  You have targeted 6 possible locations (1-6) for drop boxes.  The list of which drop boxes could be reached easily from each zone (i.e., the zone is "covered" by that drop box) is listed below.  (So, for example, if you put a drop box in location 1, that box will cover zones A, C, and E.)             Box Locations                          Zones covered              1                                              A,C             2                                             A, C,D             3                                              C,E,             4                                              B,D             5                                              A,B,E             6                                              B,C,D    Develop an Integer Programming model to determine the smallest number of locations to provide coverage to all zones. Be sure to define your decision variables.  2.If the boss tells you that Zone B is the most critical and needs to be served by at least 2 drop-boxes, how would you change your model?  3. Add constraints reflecting the following conditions        a. If you put a box in location 5, you must also put one in location 2.         b. You must put boxes in at least 2  locations.         c.

I understand that once I begin the quiz, I CANNOT have a cell phone, tablet, second computer, etc. in my work area. I MUST show my desk AND do a 360-degree room scan with the camera on my computer to prove that I do not have a secondary device on my desk. (You may use PRINTED notes and/or textbook.) If you have not already done so, show the camera your desk area AND do a 360-degree room scan. Note: if you do not do a 360-degree scan, you WILL be penalized. Anything less than 360 degrees leaves the possibility that you have another device sitting in the area you did not show and I HAVE seen students attempt to get away with this.  Violation of any of the above will result in a minimum 20 point penalty, up to forfeiture of ALL points earned.

In the parallel system illustrated in the sketch, Q1 = Q2 = 3 cfs and Q3 = 6 cfs.  The only head losses are due to the devices in lines 1, 2, and 3.       If K1 = K2 = 2, what is the change in head from c to d for the parallel components in lines 1  and 2?  Put the number only into the answer box.  The number value should be the magnitude corresponding to units of ft-lbf/lbm.  If necessary, use decimal form, not fractions.

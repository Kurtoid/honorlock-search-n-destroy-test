Identify structure #5 in the cell on the model shown:
Suppose that you are provided with a pre-written class Date as described below (this is the same one from your daily problems and labs). The headings are shown, but not the method bodies, to save space. Assume that the fields, constructor, and methods shown are already implemented. You may refer to them or use them in solving this problem if necessary. Write an instance method named subtractWeeks that will be placed inside the Date class to become a part of each Date object's behavior. The subtractWeeks method accepts an integer as a parameter and shifts the date represented by the Date object backward by that many weeks. A week is considered to be exactly 7 days. You may assume the value passed is non-negative. Note that subtracting weeks might cause the date to wrap into previous months or years. For example, if the following Date is declared in client code: Date d = new Date(9, 19); The following calls to the subtractWeeks method would modify the Date object's state as indicated in the comments. Remember that Date objects do not store the year. The date before January 1st is December 31st. Date objects also ignore leap years. Date d = new Date(9, 19); d.subtractWeeks(1); // d is now 9/12 d.subtractWeeks(2); // d is now 8/29 d.subtractWeeks(5); // d is now 7/25 d.subtractWeeks(20); // d is now 3/7 d.subtractWeeks(110); // d is now 1/26 // (2 years prior) The Date class: // Each Date object stores a single // month/day such as September 19. // This class ignores leap years. public class Date { private int month; private int day; // Constructs a date with // the given month and day. public Date(int m, int d) // Returns the date's day. public int getDay() // Returns the date's month. public int getMonth() // Returns the number of days // in this date's month. public int daysInMonth() // Modifies this date's state // so that it has moved forward // in time by 1 day, wrapping // around into the next month // or year if necessary. // example: 9/19 -> 9/20 // example: 9/30 -> 10/1 // example: 12/31 -> 1/1 public void nextDay() // your method would go here }

In the survey, people were asked if they had felt they had ever been mistreated by their superiors, as well as whether they had received a raise in the last 2 years of more than $1.

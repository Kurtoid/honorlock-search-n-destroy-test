While in hospital, this patient with a connective tissue disorder had an unfortunate event where a blood clot formed. Please answer either this question #12a with multiple drop-down answers or the following question #12b, where you will need to cover the same information in an essay format. Do not answer both questions. Only one of these two questions will be graded. The final steps involved in the formation and dissolution of a blood clot are as follows: the [answer1] residues in the N-terminal region of prothrombin are post-translationally modified in a [answer2]-dependent reaction catalyzed by [answer3]; and the modified prothrombin is then converted to [answer4] by the enzyme [answer5]. Subsequently, the protease [answer6] catalyzes the processing of fibrinogen to [answer7], which is then cross-linked in clot formation. The dissolution of the clot requires the enzyme [answer8] to catalyze the processing of [answer9] to [answer10], which then proteolytically digests the fibers of the clot. Clinically, the enzyme [answer11] is given to patients to promote clot dissolution; and the chemical [answer12] is used to stabilize clots by preventing the enzyme [answer13] from degrading the [answer14] in the clot matrix.

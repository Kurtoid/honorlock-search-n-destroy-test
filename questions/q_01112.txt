Two field engineers are measuring distances between control points. The distance recorded was found to be 500.17, Upon the report from the surveyor, the distance between the two points is supposed to be 500.00.  At the time of the measurements, the temperature of the chain was 103degF. The difference in elevation between the two points is 20 feet. The calibrated length of the chain is 100.02'. What is the actual distance between control points that must be laid out in the field to obtain the true distance between the control points?

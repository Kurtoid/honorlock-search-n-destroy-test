Begin Now(!) Following the Instructions (below)  Pan the camera around the room and desk to show that both the room and desk are empty. Show and video-record your photo ID. Put down your ID. Do not hold your ID in front to your face while speaking, The only way I have of knowing it is you completing the oral work is to see  both your Photo ID and then to see you speaking on the same recording (this procedure is called course authentication). Record with good oral expression (Record with feeling and friendly facial expressions); you are telling a story "yourself" and you want to be certain that the listeners want to meet you; your fluency (no hesitations and restarts) and "feeling" (good oral expression) will earn you points!  Take part of your set-up time to read the "Scene"; it will tell you exactly what I am looking for! When finished, follow the instructions at the bottom of this question.  Escena (Scene):  Because the protagonist in the story is an honor student, he/she has been invited to join a special nationally organized online language competition.  Before the competition begins, each participant must introduce themselves. Since all participants' personal introductions will be on national television,  all participants have been instructed by the TV Host to make certain that their self-introductions are warm, appealing, and inviting. You are my honor student, so you are pretending to be the person in the paragraph and introducing yourself to your classmates via online video (to be aired on CNN in three weeks)! Since you are introducing yourself to your peers, you are using informal language. If you are female, use Elena for your name. If you are male, use Pepe.

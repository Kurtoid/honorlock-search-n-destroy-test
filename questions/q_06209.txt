Given a string named my_string, you need to find just the second substring that matches the form AXXXA, but you only want to match if a space precedes the first A. Note that the XXX represents any characters other than white space. Note that the space preceding the first A is not to be included in the match. Finally, the code used is shown below, where you must replace ZZZ with the proper code and val will contain the match. The print command just prints the match. For example, the result of the print would be Ax9_A if the original string ismy_string = 'do not match BA4s9A but do match Ax9_A, ok?' val = re.search(r'ZZZ',my_string)print(val.group())

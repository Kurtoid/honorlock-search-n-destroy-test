A group of students has been trained to increase their score on the math segment of the S.A.T.  For the general population, S.A.T.-Math scores have the normal distribution with u=505 and s=105. It is reasonable to assume that the shape of the distribution is unchanged by training effects, but is shifted, hopefully to the right. It follows that we assume that s =105. For a random sample, of size n=25 the sample mean (sM) S.A.T.-math score is 559. Using your (Ho, Ha) from the previous problem, determine if you can reject the null hypothesis. Your answer is in form of a triple (Z Statistic, P-value, Conclusion) Conclusion is the answer to the question Reject Ho.at the a =.05 level of significance.

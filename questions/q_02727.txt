A student releases a ball from a height of 100 cm above the ground. The ball bounces to a height of 80 cm. The diagram below shows the ball's position at five different times from its starting point to its maximum height after the first bounce. Use the diagram to address the questions below.  A. Explain why the ball has kinetic energy at positions 2 and 4. B. Describe the energy transformation that occurs from position 1 to position 2 and from position 4 to position 5. C. As the ball falls from position 1 to position 3, determine the height at which the ball has approximately equal amounts of kinetic energy and potential energy. Include units in your answer. D. Why doesn't the ball bounce back to the original position of 100 cm? Relate this to the Law of Conservation of Energy.

A defendant was charged with a murder that took place in State A on July 7. His defense is that he was on vacation hundreds of miles away in State B when the murder took place and thus he could not have committed the crime. To show that he was not in the vicinity of the murder on July 7, the defendant wishes to introduce into evidence an e- mail he sent to a friend in June stating, "I'm going to spend the entire month of July at my cabin in State B." The prosecution objects. Is the e-mail admissible?

Read the following passage and the information about its source. Then decide which paraphrase of the passage conveys the important information while avoiding plagiarism. Original source:Because of physiological and behavioral differences, exposures among children are expected to be different from exposures among adults. Children may be more exposed to some environmental contaminants, because they consume more of certain foods and water per unit of body weight and have a higher ratio of body surface area to volume than adults. Equally important, rapid changes in behavior and physiology may lead to differences in exposure as a child grows up.From:Child-Specific Exposure Factors Handbook (Final Report). United States Environmental Protection Agency, Sept. 2008, ofmpub.epa.gov/eims/eimscomm.getfile?p_download_id=484738. Accessed 5 Nov. 2009.The passage appears on page 1-1.

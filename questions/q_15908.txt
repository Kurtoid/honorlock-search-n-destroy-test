Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) can be caused by acute cerebrovascular accidents (strokes). Administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 4.5 hours after first signs of symptoms can help dissolve clots in the blood vessels of the brain that are causing the lack of oxygen (ischemia) causing the stroke. However, the administration of this drug can also increase the risk for bleeding (hemorrhage) in the brain. Since the BBB is disrupted early in the injury cascade, a possible mechanism of bleeding is that the tPA is able to cross the blood-brain barrier.

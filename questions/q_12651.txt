Short Answer Essay: Choose one question below. Your response should be typewritten in basic paragraph structure (topic sentence, supporting sentences, concluding sentence). Include 10-15 grammatically correct sentences. Provide 4 specific examples from the play to support your position. Note: This is your opportunity to prove your awareness of plot summary in The Glass Menagerie. Choose supporting details carefully. Proofread carefully.   1. The Father. No name is given, but we know Williams is basing this off of his own father, Cornelius. How is his presence felt - both physically (literally) and symbolically? Is it comforting, mocking, encouraging, destructive, divisive? How does he provide safety to Laura and hope to Tom? What does he provide Amanda - regret, reality, spite? 2. Tom Wingfield. Although Tom works both as the narrator and as a character, inside and outside of Time within the context of the play, how does he seem to judge his own behavior and decisions? Is he trying to justify them, or is he viewing them objectively? How is Tom seen as the protector - almost savior - of the family, particularly of Laura? Is this a role he places himself into or one that has been placed upon him? Is he becoming his father, and is that something he embraces or detests? 3. It would be false to see Jim's character as one who is diametrically opposite of the other characters, yet so often he is viewed this way. Each character wrestles with Time - reliving one's past, coming to terms with one's present, and looking forward to one's future. Look closer at Jim - the once High School Hero - and how he wrestles with Time in these three ways. Is he different in his perspective from the other three characters - or is he just as fragile as the others? 4. Contrast Jim's recollections of high school and his memories of Laura with her own recollections. Is it too condescending or callous to say that the source and solution to Laura's timidity is simply a change in perspective, that the sound of her leg brace was louder to her than to anyone else? Or does Jim's optimistic perspective about life - Laura's and his own - serve as Williams' point?

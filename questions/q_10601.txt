You've read a claim stating that salt water is better for some types of plants than regular tap water. To test this you've purchased two plants of the same species and the same age from the same location. Both plants appear healthy at the start of the experiment. You place them both in the same type of soil. Their pots both go on a table where they will get the recommended amount of sunlight for their species. One plant you water each day with salt water, the other plant you water daily with the same amount of tap water. Once a week for three months you record the color of the plants. From this scenario identify:   Two controls. The independent variable. The dependent variable. The type of data you have collected.

Use the following information to answer the question.Giardia intestinalis can cause disease in several different mammalian species, including humans. Giardia organisms (G. intestinalis) that infect humans are similar morphologically to those that infect other mammals, thus they have been considered a single species. However, G. intestinalis has been divided into different subgroups based on their host and a few other characteristics.In 1999, a DNA sequence comparison study tested the hypothesis that these subgroups actually constitute different species. The following phylogenetic tree was constructed from the sequence comparison of rRNA from several subgroups of G. intestinalis and a few other morphologically distinct species of Giardia. The researchers concluded that the subgroups of Giardia are sufficiently different from one another genetically that they could be considered different species. (T. Monis, et al. 1999. Molecular systematics of the parasitic protozoan Giardia intestinalis. Mol. Biol. Evol. 16[9]:1135-44.)By examining the phylogenetic tree diagrammed in the figure above, what conclusion can you draw about the species G. microti?

Re: In a larger study on quality of assisted living care facilities, a new measurement scale (15 items) is developed to measure "Perceived Quality of Residential Care" (PQRC), to be used with residents in evaluating the extent to which they experience their housing as safe, supportive, strong on health care, and access to social opportunities. To validate the scale, residents from 3 Medicaid funded nursing homes (which have less resources) and an equal number of residents receiving privately funded nursing homes (which have more resources) were surveyed using this new measure. As anticipated, the evaluators found that the private nursing home residents scored significantly higher on most items of the measure.   ------------------------------------------------- In the study described above, the evaluators considered that there may be meaningful differences in the health status of residents in the nursing homes and in-home care clients and that these differences may impact the residents' experiences in their respective care.  Of the following, which is the BEST way to capture any differences in perceived quality of care across the two groups while controlling for possible differences in health status?

In a recent study by Elizabeth Snyderwine and colleagues, cDNA microarray profiling was used to compare the expression profiles for 6900 genes in normal and malignant breast tissues from rats. RNA was extracted from the following tissues:    Breast tissue from virgin rats    Breast tissue from pregnant rats    Breast tissue from lactating rats    Breast carcinoma induced by the meat-derived carcinogen PhIP    Breast carcinoma induced by the experimental carcinogen DMBA   After the microarray slides were hybridized with labeled cDNAs derived from these 5 populations of RNAs, the data were analyzed by several different comparisons. In comparison 1, tissues a, b, and c were grouped together as "normal" tissue samples, and d and e were grouped as "carcinoma" samples. Genes that were induced (more than a twofold increase in expression) in both carcinoma samples relative to all three normal samples were determined. A partial listing of induced genes is shown in the accompanying table.     Induced Genes     Cell-Growth and Cell-Cycle-related Genes      Platelet-derived growth factor A chain (PDGF-A)      Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4)      Cyclin D     Signal-Transduction and Transcription-Related Genes      STAT5a     1. What characteristic of cancer is promoted by the overexpression of PDGF-A, Cdk4, and cyclin D? 2. STAT5a is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of cyclin D, Bcl-XL (anti-apoptotic), and other genes. Why is it possible for these carcinomas that no mutation occurs in the cyclin D gene despite its overexpression? Why are mutations in transcription-factor genes like STAT5a commonly found in cancer cells? In comparison 2, expression profiles of carcinomas induced by PhIP and DMBA were compared with each other. In this analysis, some distinctions were found, but the number of differentially expressed genes was far less than the number of genes identified when comparing the grouped "normal" samples (a, b, and c) to the grouped "carcinoma" samples (d and e). 3. Based on this information, what can be generalized about the molecular profile of breast carcinomas? 4. Would you anticipate greater or fewer differences in gene expression if two distinct types of cancer (e.g., breast carcinoma vs. B-cell lymphoma) induced by the same carcinogen were compared by microarray analysis?
A syringe initially holds a sample of gas with a volume of 285 mL at 355 K and 1.88 atm. To what temperature must the gas in the syringe be heated/cooled in order to have a volume of 435 mL at 2.50 atm?

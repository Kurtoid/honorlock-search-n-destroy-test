A 50.0 mL aliquot of unknown Cu(II) solution was exhaustively electrolyzed to deposit all copper on the cathode. The mass of the cathode (the electrode) was 15.327 g prior to electrolysis and 16.414 g after electrolysis.  What was the molarity of Cu(II) in the unknown?  Hint: the molecular weight of Cu = 63.546 g/mol.

Challenging Consider two firms, Firm A and Firm B, negotiating a "financial merger" (i.e., a merger to diversify the risk of their cash inflows). Each firm's assets, before the merger, have market values of $60 million and those asset values have standard deviations of 50 percent. If the firms merge, their values will not change (i.e., they will have a combined value of $120 million), but the standard deviation of their combined asset value will fall to 30 percent. Each firm also has zero-coupon debt that matures in one year and has a face value of $40 million. Assuming that the risk-free rate is 0 percent and using the Black-Scholes model, how much will the bondholders of the firms gain at the expense of the shareholders (i.e., the so-called coinsurance effect) if Firms A and B merge? (Enter your answer to the nearest dollar. For example, for 42.5 million, enter 42,500,000. It should be a positive number)

Thomas and Julie wanted to find out which material would insulate their teacher's coffee cup and keep the coffee hot for the longest period of time. They first wrapped her cup with bubble wrap and recorded the temperature of the coffee once every 15 minutes for 2 hours. They repeated the investigation, this time using newspaper instead of bubble wrap, but they got the same results for both materials.  What could they do to make sure their results are valid?

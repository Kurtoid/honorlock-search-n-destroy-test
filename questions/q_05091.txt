In surface-water hydrology, a hydrograph is a representation of how a watershed responds to a rainfall event over time. The area under a hydrograph gives the total volume of water produced by the storm. Time and observed flow data are given in Excel under the "Final-Q4" tab. Calculate the total volume of water produced by the storm in cubic feet by applying the trapezoidal rule in Excel. Flow is given in cubic feet per second and must be converted to cubic feet per hour first before using Trapezoid Rule. 1 hour = 3600 seconds. Hint: You can find the Trapezoid Rule equations in our formula sheet. You need to decide which equation to use: Continuous Function or Discrete Data? Note: This is an Excel spreadsheet problem and no programming is required. Once complete, please type a one-word essay (e.g., "ok") for this question and then upload your combined Excel file at the very end of this exam.

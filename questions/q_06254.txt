Teamwork  The Newbury House Dictionary of American English defines the word teamwork as "a cooperative effort with each person working to reach a common goal." There are many situations when teamwork is more effective than working alone. This is most obvious when people are part of a sports team such as football or basketball. Each player on the team has a specific role, but they must rely on each other in their effort to win. Teamwork is also essential in the workplace. People work side by side on individual tasks, but often need to collaborate and share responsibilities. Finally, teamwork happens among family members at home. By practicing good communication skills and supporting each other, families strive to live in harmony. Whether in a sports team, at work, or in the home, individuals can contribute to positive outcomes when they practice good teamwork skills.       four definition quotation marks supporting   teamwork three word conclusion       The purpose of a definition paragraph is to give a [a1].

Case study #2 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is an enveloped retrovirus that has humans as its only reservoir. The spikes on HIV specifically bind to CD4 molecules of specific leukocytes and lymphocytes. After the viral genetic material is reverse transcribed by an enzyme known for its high error rate and poor proofreading, it is integrated into the host cell's chromosome. The virus then enters a period of latency. When activated, viral proteins are made using the same machinery and mechanisms as typical host cell proteins. Rapid viral replication results in the death of the host cell. A person with HIV has progressed to clinical AIDS when CD4 cells fall below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. (The CD4 count of a healthy adult/adolescent ranges from 500 cells/mm3 to 1,200 cells/mm3.)   HIV's gp120 protein binds to CD4 glycoproteins, resulting in the virus having a very narrow tropism. Thus, HIV primarily uses which cell type to replicate?

Here is the same excerpt from the Texas Supreme Court decision in Alex Sheshunoff Management Services, L.P. v. Johnson:   ASM sued Johnson, alleging breach of the covenant not to compete and seeking injunctive relief and damages.  Strunk intervened.  The court granted a temporary injunction.

The district court granted the summary judgment motions. The court then entered a final judgment.  The court of appeals affirmed.   Why does the Court provide the information in this excerpt?

Design an intervention study to address this research aim.   Describe the participants in your overall sample and the sub-sample groups. What are three independent variables (including covariates) you will measure? Why and how will you collect data on those independent variables? What are two dependent variables you will measure? Why and how will you collect data on those dependent variables? Describe the group-level research design you will use, including when you will collect data on each of the variables above, and how your design addresses issues of validity. Write two testable research questions for your study. Your research questions should explicitly address the research aim.  Be sure that you have referred to each of the independent and dependent variables somewhere in the research questions. For each research question, describe the statistical analysis you will perform to test the research question. Be clear about how you will include each of your variables as part of the statistical analysis.

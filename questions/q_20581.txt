Putting it all together... Recently, some schools have been making efforts to address bullying by teaching students about diversity at the elementary age. In one center, students were given the chance to think about implicit biases and how they impact their behavior toward others. For one activity, students were asked to review a list of actions and decide whether the actions could be performed by girls, boys, or both. At first, the students placed actions under gender titles in a stereotyped way such that actions such as "playing football" were only placed under "boys" and actions such as "playing with dolls" were only placed under "girls". By the end of the activity, however, the students had a lot of discussion and decided that all of the actions could be performed by both genders. The activity helped the children to see and understand how their own implicit biases limit their thinking. How does an activity focused on gender bias address the issue of bullying?

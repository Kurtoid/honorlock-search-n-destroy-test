A proton is moving to the right (+x-axis) at 1.0 x 107 m/s while encountering an 1.0 x 106 V/m electric and a 0.10 T magnetic field as shown in the picture. (a) Calculate the magnitude of the force experience by the proton. (b) If the proton is replace with a ring of radius 2.0 m, the electric field is turned off and the magnetic field begins to change at 0.10 T/s find the induced electric field in the ring (magnitude and direction).   Assume the ring is now at rest.

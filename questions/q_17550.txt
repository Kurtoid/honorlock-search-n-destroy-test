Instructions The R Markdown file / Jupyter Notebook file includes the questions, the empty code chunk sections for your code, and the text blocks for your responses. Answer the questions below by completing the R Markdown file / Jupyter Notebook file. You must answer the questions using one of these files. You will submit a pdf, Word or html file using one of the two files.  You may make other slight adjustments to get the file to knit/convert but otherwise keep the formatting the same. Once you've finished answering the questions, submit your responses in a single knitted/converted file (just like the homework peer assessments). There are 10 questions total, each worth between 3-7 points. Partial credit may be given if your code is correct but your conclusion is incorrect or vice versa. Next Steps:  Save the .Rmd/.ipynb file in your R working directory - the same directory where you will download the "abalone.csv" data file into. Having both files in the same directory will help in reading the abalone.csv file. Read the question and create the R code necessary within the code chunk section immediately below each question. Knitting this file will generate the output and insert it into the section below the code chunk. Type your answer to the questions in the text block provided immediately after the response prompt. Once you've finished answering all questions, knit this file and submit the knitted file on Canvas.  Example Question 10 - 4pts This will be the exam question - each question is already copied from Canvas and inserted into individual text blocks below, you do not need to copy/paste the questions from the online Canvas exam. # Example code chunk area. Enter your code below the comment Response to Question 10: This is the section where you type your written answers to the question. Depending on the question asked, your typed response may be a number, a list of variables, a few sentences, or a combination of these elements.   Ready? Let's begin.

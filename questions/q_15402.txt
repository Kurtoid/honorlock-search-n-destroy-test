Assume an insurance company must make a payment of $13,310 in three years and that the term structure of interest rates is flat at 10%. The company's portfolio manager decides to fund the company's obligation using two-year and six-year zero-coupon bonds, both with a face value of $100. Since the manager has a Masters in Finance from FIU,  the hedge is perfectly executed and the manager receives a promotion. One year later, the manager remembers the lessons from the Fixed Income class and decides to check the weights on each hedging instrument to see if they need to be adjusted. After the recalculations, what is the weight w that the manager decides to put on the now five-year zero-coupon bond (i.e., the six-year zero-coupon in the previous year)? Remark: Remember that the weight w is simply the fraction of the portfolio invested on that particular bond, exactly as in your lecture notes.

The patient is an 84-year-old female who was brought to the emergency department by her family upon the advice of the family physician. The patient said she had increasing abdominal pain, nausea and some vomiting. This condition started two to three days ago, and the patient could not eat due to the nausea. Prior to this episode of illness the patient had been reasonably well, receiving medications for hypertension and hypothyroidism. The patient was admitted. Overnight the patient appeared to become more acutely ill, developed respiratory distress, and the rapid response team evaluated her and obtained her physician's order to transfer her to the ICU. Soon after, the patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure. The patient had signs and symptoms of septicemia and sepsis possibly with an intra-abdominal source. Blood cultures grew E. coli. She was taken to the operating room, where she underwent an exploratory laparotomy. The surgeons found acute bowel ischemia and gangrene involving 100 percent of the small bowel and the right colon. This was an inoperable condition, and the laparotomy site was closed. The family was advised of the patient's very poor prognosis and offered hospice care, which they accepted. The mechanical ventilation was discontinued after 24 hours in place, and the patient was extubated. She was kept as comfortable as possible overnight and expired in the early morning hours of hospital day four. The physician s final diagnoses were acute ischemic and gangrenous intestine, acute respiratory failure, E. coli septicemia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.  Principal diagnosis: [dx1]Secondary diagnoses: [dx2]Principal procedure: [proc1]Secondary procedure(s): [proc2]Assign MS-DRG: [msdrg1]

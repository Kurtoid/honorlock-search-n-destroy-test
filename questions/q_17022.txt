P1V1T2 = P2V2T1                          1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr A 0.823 L sample of carbon dioxide, initially at 0.25 atm of pressure is compressed until it occupies only 93.2 ml.  If temperature remains constant, what is the final pressure, in mm Hg, of the gas? To receive full credit:  You must use the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the final gas law equation (with numbers and units) that you used to solve the problem. Show your work (equation/and units) by using the equation editor () in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use    to insert ratios. Be sure to include proper units and the final answer!

On the map of North America below, identify the air mass associated with the source region for each number listed just above the map. Write the name of the air mass. You can indicate the two-letter symbol as well (not required), but the name is required. NOTE: You will see this map for four (4) questions in a row. For each question, you only need to identify ONE (1) air mass - you do NOT need to identify them for all eight numbers. The number for which this question is asking is in RED just above the map and just below these instructions. Each is worth 0.5 points. It is designed this way so that Canvas can select four random numbers for each student, and you can still see the map for each question. You do NOT have to read these instructions again for each question; they are the same for each, so please do not waste your exam time re-reading them unless you need to.   For this question, identify the air mass at the source region at location 8.

Schacter and Gross (1968) gathered data from a group of 60 male students for about one hour in the afternoon. At the end of this period of time, a clock on the wall was correct (5:30 p.m.) for 20 participants, slow (5:00 p.m.) for 20 others, and fast (6:00 p.m.) for 20 more. The actual time for all groups was 5:30 p.m., the usual dinnertime for these students. While participants filled out a final questionnaire, the experimenters provided crackers for the students to eat. The weight of the crackers each student consumed was measured. The arithmetic means were 5:00 p.m. group, 20 grams; 5:30 p.m. group, 30 grams; 6:00 p.m. group, 40 grams.

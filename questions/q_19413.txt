Question Three - 50 minutes               Idabel Pterodactyl is a sole practitioner lawyer.  She is a great lawyer with great clients, but she isn't very good at paperwork.  She is generally slow to send bills and reminders, so her clients owe her a fair amount of money for fees.  They are all likely to pay when she bills them, but they can't pay until she sends a bill.   Idabel wanted to expand her office, so she asked ABC Bank for a loan.  ABC was concerned about her ability to pay, but Idabel explained that she would have plenty of money from her clients once she billed them.  ABC agreed to give her the loan if she would give it a security interest in the amounts her clients owed her.  Idabel agreed and signed a document granting ABC a security interest in "all client accounts, now existing or arising hereafter".  ABC filed a financing statement, but it spelled Idabel's name Terodactyl instead of Pterodactyl.     A.  (5 minutes) When Idabel realized that ABC Bank had used the wrong name on the financing statement, she decided that the security agreement wasn't enforceable.  She figured that she was free to keep all the money her clients paid her whether she repaid ABC Bank or not.  Is Idabel correct?  Explain.   About 18 months later, Idabel planned to purchase expensive new office equipment from Hugo's Office Supply, and she asked Hugo's to finance the purchase.  (In other words, she wanted to pay on credit.)  Hugo's said that it was willing to do so, but that even if it protected itself with a security interest in the equipment it would not be fully secured, since the equipment would never be worth what she paid for it and what she owed Hugo's.  (That's true - the resale value of used office equipment is a small fraction of its original price.)  Idabel said, "Don't worry, I have plenty of money coming in from my clients."  (Idabel thought that she was free of the security interest she had given ABC Bank because ABC used the wrong name when it filed, and Hugo's did not find a filing for the accounts when it searched the UCC filings under Idabel's correct name.)  Hugo's agreed to sell the equipment on credit in exchange for a security interest in the equipment and in the amount her clients owed Idabel.  Idabel agreed to this and signed a document to that effect.  Hugo's filed a financing statement using Idabel's correct name and in the correct location.     B.  (5 minutes) How should Hugo's describe the collateral in the financing statement?  (There is more than one correct answer to this question.)   About six months after the purchase from Hugo's, Idabel became ill and was unable to practice law.  Her financial situation deteriorated and she has now filed for bankruptcy.  Idabel's bankruptcy estate, ABC Bank, and Hugo's Office Supply are all trying to figure out what they can get from Idabel.  Idabel owes ABC Bank about $35,000.  Idabel owes Hugo's about $20,000.  The office equipment is worth about $8,000.  The client accounts are worth about $60,000.     After Idabel's bankruptcy, ABC Bank checked its paperwork and realized that it had mis-spelled Idabel's name on its financing statement.  It filed a new financing statement with Idabel's name spelled correctly.     Be careful to answer only the questions I ask, below.   C.  (5-10 minutes) Assume that Hugo's correctly filed a financing statement covering the office equipment but NOT Idabel's client's accounts.  What will Hugo be entitled to in the bankruptcy and why?     D.  (10 minutes) Now assume that Hugo's correctly filed a financing statement covering both the office equipment and the accounts.  As between Hugo's and ABC Bank, which will have the prior claim to Idabel's clients' accounts?  (Do not address bankruptcy issues in your answer to this question.)   E.  (10 minutes) New Scenario:  There has not been a bankruptcy.  ABC Bank made its loan and filed the incorrect financing statement in February 2018.  Hugo's correctly filed its financing statement on October 1, 2019.  ABC Bank realized its mistake and filed a correct financing statement on July 1, 2020.  Idabel hired an accountant and started billing her clients and collecting the amounts they owed.  By October 2019, all the clients that owed Idabel money were different from the clients who owed her money in February 2018.  By July 2020, Idabel had another completely new set of clients.  As between ABC Bank and Hugo's Office Supply, who has priority on the amounts clients owe on July 1, 2020?     END OF EXAM   Have a great summer.

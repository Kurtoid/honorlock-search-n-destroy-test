In order to make the loan with its original principal of $285,000, the lender requires you to obtain private mortgage insurance (PMI) on their behalf.

Reaction coordination diagrams for the formation of alkyl radicals by the chlorine radical and bromine radical are shown below.  A bromine radical is 1600 times more likely to abstract a hydrogen from a tertiary carbon over a primary carbon, while the chlorine radical is only 5 times more likely to abstract a tertiary carbon hydrogen over a primary carbon hydrogen.  How do these diagrams explain the difference in selectivity for formation of the most highly substituted radical in chlorination versus bromination?

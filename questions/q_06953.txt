Glucose and glucose-6-phosphate (Glucose-6-P) do not move across artificial membranes (made of phospholipids but lacking proteins). To further your understanding of cell membrane functions, you conducted an experiment on the transport of glucose and glucose-6-P into living muscle cells. At the start of the experiment, the concentration of both kinds of molecules outside the cells was 1.0 Molar (M). The original concentration of each molecule inside the cells was 0.1 M. (column labeled 0 hr). After 2 hours, the concentration of each molecule inside the cells was measured (column labeled 2 hr). As a follow-up, you add cyanide at this point (2 hr after start time) to the cells in the continuing experiment. This stops all ATP production inside the cells. Two hours later (4 hours total), you again determine the level of the test molecules inside the cells (column labeled +2 hr +Cyanide). Muscle Cells Intracellular Concentrations:     Time   0 hr   2 hr   +2 hr +Cyanide     Glucose   0.1M   0.5M   1.0M     Glucose-6-P   0.1M   0.1M   0.1M      Is glucose being transported into the muscle cells? If that is the case, through which process does uptake take place? Write the number of your choice and explain your reasoning in the text box.  No, it is not being transported into the cells Yes, it is being transported by simple diffusion Yes, it is being transported by facilitated diffusion Yes, it is being transported by active transport There is not enough information to determine the type of process

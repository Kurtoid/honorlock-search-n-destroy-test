Work in the coal breakers is exceedingly hard and dangerous. Crouched over the chutes, the boys sit hour after hour, picking out the pieces of slate and other refuse from the coal as it rushes past to the washers. From the cramped position they have to assume, most of them become more or less deformed and bent-backed like old men. When a boy has been working for some time and begins to get round-shouldered, his fellows say that "He's got his boy to carry round wherever he goes." The coal is hard, and accidents to the hands, such as cut, broken, or crushed fingers, are common among the boys. Sometimes there is a worse accident: a terrified shriek is heard, and a boy is mangled and torn in the machinery, or disappears in the chute to be picked out later smothered and dead. Clouds of dust fill the breakers and are inhaled by the boys, laying the foundations for asthma and miners' consumption. . . .

You have a new client that has been administering moxidectin every 3 months for the last 5 years just like her feed store told her to do. She has called you because she started to see white worms in her horses' feces and she is worried that she should have been giving the dewormer more often. You explain her to her about the possibility of drug resistance but she doesn't believe you. So you suggest checking the egg count as numbers do not lie. She agrees. You take a collection of feces from multiple horses (a single group sample) that the client saw with white worms and perform a fecal egg count. You then have her give the anthelmintic and 2 weeks later get another sample. Here is the following information. Calculate the fecal egg reduction test and determine if resistance is present.

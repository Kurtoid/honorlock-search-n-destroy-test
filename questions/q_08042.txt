Ms. Kabilus is a second grade teacher at Bachelder Elementary School in Hartford, Connecticut. Her second grade class is made up of 20 students including 12 boys and 8 girls. Two students within her classroom receive special education services related to difficulties with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Both students struggle with impulse control, difficulty accepting correction/criticism, and difficulty regulating emotions. Since returning from spring break, Ms. Kabilus has noticed that a group of students in her class (7 students - 3 male, 4 female, including the two students with ADHD) have been engaging in disruptive behavior during small group work and centers/stations. The disruptive behavior includes: Talking loudly/yelling, working on personal interests instead of on assigned tasks (e.g., coloring, writing notes, playing with cell phones and toys), and horseplay (e.g., tackling, pretending to hit peers but not actually hitting them). Ms. Kabilus wants to use one of the strategies she learned about in her EEX 3616 classroom management class focused on responding to inappropriate behavior (i.e., error correction, or differential reinforcement, or planned ignoring, or response cost, or time-out from reinforcement, or pre-correction).  Please create a plan for Ms. Kabilus using at least one of the strategies you learned to respond to inappropriate behavior. Your plan needs to include the following: 1. A brief identification and description of the inappropriate behaviors that will be targeted for change (2 pt) 2. A brief identification and description of the REPLACEMENT behaviors Ms. Kabilus will want to see students performing instead (2 pt) 3. Identify and briefly describe at least one strategy that Ms. Kabilus can us to respond to the inappropriate behaviors when they occur AND make sure to include how this strategy or strategies will also teach students to use the replacement behavior identified above (6 pts)  4. State how data will be collected and used to determine if Ms. Kabilus's intervention is effective (1 pt)

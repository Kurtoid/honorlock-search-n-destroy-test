A Shaman is attacking a dragon. The Shaman's normal attack does 250 damage.  There is a 15% chance of getting a critical strike for 500 damage, and a 20% chance of getting a Windfury attack for 800 damage.  There is also a 10% chance that his attack will miss, causing 0 damage.  Let the random variable X represent the damage his attack does. Sketch a table showing the different possible values of X, and the probability of each. Which would be more useful, a talent that increases the Shaman's overall damage by 5%, or a talent that increases the chance of getting a critical strike by 5%?

Creative Corporation issued bonds and received the face amount of $1,000,000 ten years ago. Since interest rates have declined significantly during that time and since the corporation is experiencing financial difficulty during the current year the bondholders agree to sell their bonds for a total of $610,000. By declaring Title 11 bankruptcy the corporation can obtain government assistance cash equal to $795,000. The corporation uses $610,000 to buy the bonds and reduces their liabilities by $1,000,000 when the bonds are retired. The other $185,000 of government assistance money is used to provide working capital for the business. The government program that provides the $795,000 of government assistance explicitly says that the funds are excluded from a recipient's gross income as a social welfare payment. How much, if any, will Creative include in its federal gross income in the current year as a result of these transactions?
Refer to the previous question on Airbus.   If Airbus decides to hedge using put options on U.S. dollars, what would be the 'expected' euro proceeds from the American sale? Assume that Airbus regards the current forward exchange rate as an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Answer in Euros to two decimal places and do not use a currency symbol.   Hint: When calculating the euro proceeds (aka "net payoff" or "profit") from the hedged aircraft sale, first think about the exchange rate at which the firm will convert dollars into euros, which will give you the payoff in euros in six months. Then, calculate the future value of the option premium in euros. Then, subtract the future value of the option premium from the euro payoff. Hint 2: Assume that interest is calculated using linear compounding.

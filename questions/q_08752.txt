You are presented with Pascal's Wager and, although taking it seriously, you are overwhelmed by all the possible theistic beliefs and decide that agnosticism is the best option despite what Pascal thinks.  Upon death, you discover that God does indeed exist and, to your consternation, that Pascal had it right.  The atheists are getting sent right to hell while the theists (all of them as it turns out) are getting sent to heaven.  It happens that you are the only agnostic who has died this day.  God demands to know why you did not heed the wise words of Pascal and choose to be a theist.  How would you respond, given that you chose agnosticism partly in an effort to avoid offending God (if it turned out that God actually existed) by either being an atheist or choosing the wrong religion as a theist?  Explain your defense of your choice of agnosticism.

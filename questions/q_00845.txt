Alex Jewelers is a jewelry manufacturer in Jacksonville, FL. The company specializes in making necklaces and rings. The two main resources utilized by Alex Jewelers are labor and gold. The amount of labor it limited to 40 hours a week and the amount of gold is limited to 110 ounces a week. Producing a ring requires two hours of labor and 3 ounces of gold and can be sold for a $400 profit. Producing a necklace requires 1 hour of labor and 4 ounces of gold and can be sold for a $350 profit. Since Alex is super popular everyone wants to buy jewelry from him, so he requires at least 20 new units to be manufactured per week.  Set up the two-phase LP Alex should use to start. If producing at optimality, how much profit should Alex expect to make? What would the optimal value be if Alex could raise the amount of gold to (assume no basis change):  120 ounces 140 ounces   Assuming there is a basis change when the amount of available gold reaches 160 ounces, give bounds on the optimal value change if the amount of gold available was raised to:  180 ounces 200 ounces   What would be the optimal value if, due to a gold shortage, it dropped to (assume no basis change):  100 ounces 90 ounces   Assuming there is a basis change when the amount of available gold hits 85 ounces, give bounds on the optimal value change if the amount of gold available was raised to:  80 ounces 50 ounces   What would be the optimal value if Alex could increase the labor amount available per week to (assume no basis change):  50 hours 65 hours   Assuming there is a basis change when the amount of available labor reaches 70 hours, give bounds on the optimal value change if the amount of labor available was raised to:  80 hours 95 hours   What would be the optimal value if Alex had an employee quit so the available labor was now (assume no basis change):  35 hours 30 hours   Assuming there is a basis change when the amount of available labor reaches 20 hours, give bounds on the optimal value change if the amount of labor available was lowered to:  15 hours 10 hours     What would be the optimal value if Alex becomes less popular and the minimum amount of jewelry drops to (assume no basis change):  15 10   Is there a constraint that can be dropped from the model without changing the optimal solution? Justify.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe peripheral arterial disease, arterial insufficiency due to aorto-iliac occlusive disease or atherosclerosis POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Atherosclerosis of native arteries, bilateral legs, with intermittent claudication OPERATION: Open aorto-bifemoral bypass graft  INDICATIONS: The patient is a 78-year-old male who has complained of muscle aches, cramping and pain in his legs from his thighs to his feet for several years and he states it is getting worse. He has limited mobility as the cramping in his legs prevent him from walking more than a block. On physical exam, he has diminished pulses in his legs with very faint pulses in his feet. He underwent an abdominal aortogram plus bilateral iliofemoral angiography of the lower extremities as an outpatient a month ago and was found to have severe aorto-iliac occlusive disease due to atherosclerosis. The patient was treated for carcinoma of the small bowel over 10 years ago with no recurrence. The patient has also been under treatment in the hospital for essential hypertension that he has had for many years. He also quit smoking 20 years ago. The patient was given the risks and benefits of an aorto-bifemoral vascular graft and he consented to the procedure with the hope of eliminating the pain and cramping in his legs that will allow him to become more active again. PROCEDURE: The patient was prepped and draped, and groin incisions were opened. The common femoral vein and its branches were isolated, and rubber loops were placed around the vessels. At the completion of this, the abdomen was opened and explored. The patient was found to have evidence of radiation therapy in the abdominal wall and some of the small bowel due to his past treatments for history of carcinoma of the small intestine. The remainder of the abdominal exploration was unremarkable. After the abdomen was explored, a Balfour retractor was put in place. The abdominal aorta and iliac vessels were mobilized. Bleeding points were controlled with electrocoagulation. The tapes were placed around the vessel. The vessel was measured, and the abdominal aorta was found to be a 12-mm vessel. An 11 x 6 bifurcated micro-velour graft was then pre-clotted with the patient's own blood. An end-to-end anastomosis was made on the aorta and the graft using a running suture of 2-0 Prolene. The limbs were taken down through tunnels, and an end-to-side anastomosis was made between the graft and the femoral arteries with running suture of 4-0 Prolene. The inguinal incisions were closed with running sutures of 2-0 Vicryl and steel staples in the skin. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with steel staples. A sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the recovery room in adequate condition.

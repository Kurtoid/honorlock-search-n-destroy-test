The state education commission wants to estimate the fraction of tenth grade students that have reading skills at or below the eighth grade level. Provide answers to each of the following steps: You must show your work or explain your calculator speak.  Answers without one or the other will not be given full credit. Step 1. Suppose a sample of 1265 tenth graders is drawn. Of the students sampled, 253 read at or below the eighth grade level. Using the data, estimate the proportion of tenth graders reading at or below the eighth grade level. Enter your answer as a fraction or a decimal number rounded to three decimal places.Answer: ____________________Step 2. Suppose a sample of 1265 tenth graders is drawn.

Hyrule Corp. began operations in 2020.  For 2020, Hyrule's pretax accounting income was $290,000, which includes expenses of $13,000 related to tax-exempt municipal bond income and $7,000 of insurance premiums on a life insurance policy for a key officer.  Hyrule uses a different depreciation method for financial reporting than it does for tax purposes.  Hyrule's depreciable assets were all purchased on January 1, 2020 for a cost of $800,000.  At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of all the depreciable assets was $780,000 and the tax basis was $765,000.  This depreciation difference will reverse in a period after 2022.  Hyrule offers a two-year warranty on its products.  During 2020, the product warranty liability accrued for financial reporting purposes was $150,000 and the amount paid for the satisfaction of warranty liability was $80,000.  Hyrule expects to settle the remaining amount equally over the next two years.  As of December 31, 2020, the enacted tax rates are 35% for 2020, 40% for 2021, and 45% thereafter. For 2021, Hyrule's pretax accounting income was $405,000, which includes $150,000 proceeds from a life insurance policy taken out on a key officer of Hyrule.  Hyrule also qualified for a dividends received deduction for tax purposes of $10,000.  Hyrule's pretax financial income included $25,000 of installment sales income that has yet to be collected.  This income is expected to be collected evenly over the next two years.  Hyrule continues to use a different depreciation method for financial reporting than it does for tax purposes.  At December 31, 2021, the carrying value of all the depreciable assets was $760,000 and the tax basis was $740,000.  As before, this depreciation difference will reverse in a period after 2022.  The remaining differences between pretax accounting income and taxable income are due to any reversals of the 2020 temporary differences.  The tax rate for 2021 was 40%, but legislation was enacted on June 20, 2021 that will change the tax rate in future years to 41%.  In 2021, management of Hyrule determined that it is more likely than not that 34% of the related deferred tax asset will not be fully realized because of pending changes in IRS regulations.

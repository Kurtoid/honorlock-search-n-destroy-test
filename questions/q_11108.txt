Question 2 A researcher working at the Los Alamos National Lab is developing a new technology for harnessing solar energy. In order to satisfy the conditions of the grant that funds her lab, she has to create 6 working prototypes before the end of the year.  For each prototype that she produces, there is a 30% chance that it is fully functional and can be considered a working prototype.   What is the probability that she has at least 3 failed prototypes before the 6th working prototype is created? What distribution should be used to model this problem?

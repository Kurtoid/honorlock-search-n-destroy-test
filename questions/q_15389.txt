3. As shown in figure 3, Two blocks are connected by a string of negligible mass passing over a pulley of radius r = 40 cm and a moment of inertia I (I =1/2Mr2).  The block on the frictionless incline is moving up the incline with a constant acceleration 3 m/s2. a) Draw the individual free body diagrams for each block and the pulley. b) Determine the tension (T1) on the string over the incline. c) Determine the tension (T2) on the string over the counterweight (m2). d) Determine the moment of inertia (I ) of the pulley.

Which assessment data alerts the nurse to the fact that the patient is at risk for an embolic stroke?
The image below shows the initial volume (mL) of a titrant just prior to the start of a titration. The identiy of the tirant is NaOH (aq) at a concentration of 1.0910 M. Assume that the analyte of the titration is 10.256 mL of acetic acid.  Report your answer to each question or problem below. Make sure you reference your answers by numbering them according to the question or problem. You do not need to show calculations. 1. Using the maximum precision available, report the value of the initial volume of titrant along with its correct unit(s) of measure. (2 pts) 2. What is the name of the device that is most likely shown in the image? (1 pt) 4. Choose a final volume for the titration that is somewhere between 31.2 mL and 30.5 mL and record this number to the same precision available as the initial volume in Question 1. Use this value to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid sample prior to titration. Show all calculations. (7 pt)

A hypothetical gene that codes for a variant of myosin that in some cases allows skeletal muscle to present "super strength"  adheres to the paramutation mechanism of epigenetic control, except that transformed alleles cannot transform wild type alleles. Epialleles present in this gene are A which codes for regular strength and A' which codes for super strength and is paramutagenic. A'* represents a transformed epiallele that was wild type. If parents have the following genotypes: Mother A'*A   and father AA, what are the phenotypes of the parents and which is the probability that their kids will present super strength?
In a certain cactus, prickly spines can be two-pronged or one-pronged.  If a true-breeding one-pronged cactus is crossed with a true-breeding two-pronged cactus, the F1 generation has a mixture of spines, some are two-pronged, some are one-pronged. Is this an example of codominance or incomplete dominance?

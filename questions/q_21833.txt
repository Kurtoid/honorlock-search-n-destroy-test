Background Imagine you manage a widget factory. You have a CSV file with the following columns:  Widget_name (the name of a widget, a string) Widget_type (the category a widget belongs to, a string) Mfg_cost (the cost to manufacture one widget, a float) Retail_price (the price of one widget, a float) Units_sold_2020 (how many units of the widget were sold in 2020, an integer)  For a given widget, per-unit profit is the retail price of that widget minus the manufacturing cost. Instructions Write a function that takes one argument, a string containing a path to a CSV file like the one described above. Your function should return a Pandas Series object containing the maximum per-unit profit of each widget type. Your analysis should include only widgets for which at least 1000 units were sold in 2020. You can assume Pandas was imported as pd. For full credit, your solution should not use any loops. You may not use any module other than Pandas.

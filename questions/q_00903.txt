What is the expected value of the probability distribution in question 8.           a) For a binomial experiment, how many outcomes are possible for each trial ?              b) In a binomial experiment, is it possible for the probability of success to change from one trial                 to the next ?        Consider a binomial experiment with n=10 trials where the probability of success on a single trial is p=0.7. Find Prob(r=4).             (a) What is the expected value of the binomial distribution in question 11 ?                (b) What is the standard deviation of the binomial distribution in question 11 ?

A gale force wind occurs on average once every 60 hours on a mountain road. For an interval of 300 hours, what is the prob. that 3 gale force winds are experienced ? Hint, use a Poisson distribution.                   Allison is a 65% basketball free throw shooter. She is interested in how many attempts it takes to make 4 baskets. What is the probability that it takes 12 attempts ?                 What is the mean and standard deviation of the Standard Normal distribution ?           What does the empirical rule say about the approximate percent of observations in a normal distribution that lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean?           Assume that the heights of college women are normally distributed with mean 65 inches and standard deviation 2.5 inches. Using the empirical rule, what is the approximate percentage of college women who are shorter than 67.5 inches.             What does a z-score represent ?                 Consider a normal distribution with mean=20 and standard deviation=4                                                                                                                        (a) Find a z value corresponding to an x value of 14                   (b) Find the data value corresponding to a z value of 1.5                  Find the area under the standard normal curve                                                                                                                                                                                       (a)   To the right of z=1.52                  (b)   Between z=1.40 and z=2.03                      If x has a normal distribution with mean=40 and standard deviation=15,            find Prob  ( 30

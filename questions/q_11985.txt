D3 Banking Tech is trying to issue an IPO. The goal is to issue 1 million shares to raise funds. But there are both informed and uninformed investors in the market. Informed investors can observe the true value of the shares, and they will only order if they see the true value of the shares is higher than the price set by the underwriter. Uninformed investors cannot observe the value of the shares and they will always order 1 million shares so long as the price is set at the expected value. There will be 50% of chance that the share worths $16 and another 50% chance that the share worths $4, which means the expected fair price is $10. What is the percentage of underpricing the underwriter has to set in order for the IPO deal to be made with the presence of both informed and uninformed investors (percentage as of the price set by the underwriter)?

Tiffany is a 43-year-old female with a family history of breast cancer in her mother, 1 of 3 maternal aunts, and a paternal grandmother. All of the women were diagnosed postmenopausally.  She is 5'7" and weight is 179 pounds (BMI 28).  Menarche at age 14.  Her first live birth was at age 25, she has 3 children total.  She continues to have regular periods every 28-30 days.  She has never smoked. She does drink a glass of wine each night but will sometimes have 2-3 glasses on Friday and Saturday nights. She walks for 30 minutes 2 days per week.  Her mother did undergo genetic testing and was found to be negative.  You have used the IBIS risk model and determined her lifetime risk to be 26.3%.  What interventions would you recommend at this time? 0.5 points given for each intervention.

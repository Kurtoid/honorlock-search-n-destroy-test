Verifying Max-Flow: For a flow network G=(V,E) with specified s and t and capacities c[e]>0 for edge e, we are given a flow f (you are given f[e] for every edge e).  It is claimed that f is a maximum flow.Explain an algorithm to verify/check whether or not f is a maximum flow.Be sure to state the running time of your algorithm.(Faster -- and correct -- is worth more credit.) Use the algorithms from class as black-boxes, namely DFS, BFS, Explore, Topological Sort, SCC, and Dijkstra's.  Describe your algorithm in words and state the running time (faster is worth more).   No pseudocode.. You cannot use Ford-Fulkerson or any other max-flow algorithm as a black box for this problem.  if you want to do similar to one of these max-flow algorithms then you have to restate and explain the steps of the algorithm.

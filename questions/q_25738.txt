Fill in the blank with the appropriate choice.  Only the best answer will count as the correct answer.  Each answer is used only once 5. A comparison of types of play found in mammals by Robert Fagen with types of play described for Parakana children by Yumi Gosso shows that human children engage in new kinds of play (such as "symbolic play" and "______with rules") that are not found in other animals. These kinds of play are unique to our species.  6. At birth, about _________ of the energy metabolized by human infants is used by the brain while the remainder is used by the body. In adult humans, about 20% of available metabolic energy is used by the brain.  7. The process of creating connections between neurons is known as_________. It is completed earlier in the part of the brain responsible for vision and hearing.  It peaks later in the frontal lobes of the brain responsible for planning and thinking.  The process of creating connections among neurons of the frontal lobes continues in adults but at a much lower rate than in immature humans. 8. Using PET scans to measure glucose utilization, Chugani discovered that 3-year old humans have brains which are ______ as active as adults (they are building connections among neurons at ______ the rate of adults). Glucose utilization remains at this rate until children reach 10 years of age and only gradually changes to the adult level at about 18 years of age. [Note the same word is used in all blanks]. 9. Exuberant overconnectivity of neurons during childhood is accompanied by ________ of unused connections and strengthening of frequently used connections.  As described by Diamond and Hopson, this principle of brain circuitry construction is known as "use it or lose it."  10. When Byers saw that play rates in Norway rats, domestic cats and house mice peaked at the same time as terminal synapse formation peaked in the cerebellum, he suggested that the function of play was to shape _______ development. 11. To test the above hypothesis, Byers looked at play rates and brain size in marsupials. He found that play was common in the marsupial species with the ________ brains while it was absent in other marsupials.   12. An early analysis of emotional communication by Darwin emphasized that species-typical emotional expression has evolved in both humans and other animals. He published his findings in an 1872 book which showed pictures of human infants expressing grief using _____expression while emotions expressed by dogs showed minimal ______ expression but dramatic postural changes.    [Note that the same term is used in both blanks] 13. Paul MacLean described the evolutionary emergence of brain structures and emotions which support the mother-infant relationship as a "________revolution" which is found in mammals but not in reptiles.   14. John Bowlby suggested that an emotional-behavioral process he called _________keeps young children in proximity to their caretaker. He found that hospitalized children experienced (and communicated) extreme distress when separated from their parents even when their physical needs were met and hospital staff behaved in a kindly manner.  15. Bowlby proposed that hospitalized children who protest the departure of their parents are behaving appropriately given the dangers that ancient human children would have faced in the "environment of________ adaptedness" if they became separated from their parents. This is the environment that shaped human psychology over the "deep time"/evolutionary history of our species.

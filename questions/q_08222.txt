A gaseous mixture consisting of 50 mol % hydrogen and 50 mol% acetaldehyde (C2H4O) is initially contained in a rigid vessel at a total pressure of 760 mm Hg abs.  Ethanol (C2H6O) is the only product of the reaction.  After a time it was noted that the pressure had dropped to 700 mm Hg.  Assuming all reactants and products are gases and that the vessel and contents were at the same temperature when the two pressure readings were taken, determine the degree of completion of the reaction.
According to the elaboration likelihood model, if we're going to think long and hard about the argument, we're using peripheral route to processing.

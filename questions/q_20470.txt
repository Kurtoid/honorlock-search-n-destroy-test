Plant Food II (Canvas Q14~16, Handwritten Pages Q14) Background: Many different types of fertilizers exist depending on the needs of the specific plant and the location it is planted in. The fertilizers from Exam 1 were examples of NP fertilizers: they supply plants with a source of nitrogen and phosphorus. Other nutrients necessary for plant growth include potassium, sulfur, and calcium, among many others. A popular choice due to its abundant availability is calcium nitrate, as it is relatively cheap and supplies both calcium and nitrogen to the plant. Question: A farmer has [m1].[m2] g of pure calcium nitrate available. How many nitrate ions are present in this sample? Start by writing out a path. (Additional 8 points) On your Handwritten Pages, show all of your work and box your final answer. ( Q14 ) Type in only the numerical portion of your answer using E notation, properly rounded to the correct number of sig figs, here. For example, 2.5 x 1015 should be entered as "2.5e15". (Note: Canvas may change your number back into standard notation - this is okay. However, your handwritten work should use proper scientific notation - no E notation in writing!)
Two of the genes that affect coat color in horses are the extension gene and the cream dilution gene. The dominant E allele at the extension gene generates black coats, while the recessive e allele produces red coats. The coat color caused by the extension gene is not altered if the horse is a homozygote for the C allele at the cream dilution gene. However, if the horse is a homozygote for the CCr allele at the cream dilution gene, it will have a white coat regardless of the extension genotype. This interaction between the extension and the cream dilution gene is an example of

The following prompt refers to questions 22 and 23. Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the causal agent of the upper respiratory infection, diphtheria.  C. diphtheriae produces a toxin that damages host cells.  The diphtheria toxin is only produced when the external concentration of iron is low (common in host cells). The tox genes are under negative control, wherein a regulatory protein (DtxR) binds to the regulatory region when iron is present.  When iron is not available, DtxR is unbound.
To be scored "true" the statement must be true in its entirety.  If any part of a statement is false, then the entire answer should be scored "false."  Q#15.

Explain the difference between performing simple "what-if" analysis and using the Goal Seek tool using the worksheet shown in Figure 3 below. Assume that a formula is used in cell B6 to calculate the amount financed and that the PMT function is used in cell B10 to calculate the payment amount.  Both use references to the input values in column B.  Figure 3 a. Simple What-if Analysis:Assuming the formulas/functions correctly use cell references, state which input cell(s) a user would enter new value(s) in and which cell(s) would be automatically recalculated by the Excel program to produce new results. Use CELL REFERENCES to the cells in Figure 3 to cite SPECIFIC CELLS in your answer.   b. Goal Seek Analysis:To perform Goal Seek analysis for Figure 3 give the values that would be entered for Goal Seek's three arguments: Set cell:_______, To value:__________, and By changing value______Use cell references where appropriate in your answers.  Also answer the follow questions regarding Goal Seek:i)  How many input values may be changed at one time?ii)  Which cell must contain a formula or function? Begin each of your answers by typing a title line as shown below: a. Simple What-If Analysis: b. Goal Seek Analysis:

You are about to surprise someone with a flower bouquet that you are hiding behind your back. When bringing your arm forward to present the flowers, your arm plus the flower bouquet weigh 6 lb., and their center of gravity is located 12 inches from the axis of the GH joint. How much force would your anterior deltoid muscle need to exert in order to hold your humerus at 90 degrees of flexion (with the elbow extended) if its moment arm is 0.6 inches? The formulas you need to solve this problem are: 1) torque = force x moment arm; 2) Sum of torques St = 0.

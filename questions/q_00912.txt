A 37-year-old man undergoes a mitral valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease. While waking up from general anesthesia, he reports weakness of his right foot and numbness of the dorsal aspect of the foot. He does not report any pain in the area. His foot drop symptoms do not improve with conservative management, and he is scheduled for electromyography (EMG) twelve weeks later. On examination of the right lower extremity, a near-complete foot and toe drop are appreciated. Eversion of the foot is markedly weak (3/5) and dorsiflexion is 1/5; however, inversion and plantar flexion are 5/5. His deep tendon reflexes, including ankle jerk, are within normal limits. Sensation is impaired to light touch and pinprick sensation over the dorsal aspect of the foot. EMG and Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) testing of the right lower extremity is a recording of what nerve and where is the likely lesion?

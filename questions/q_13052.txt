Thekkath's paper on Low Latency Communication presents summarizes the results of running a benchmark similar to "ping" for each of the 4 different networks and network interfaces evaluated in the paper. Answer the following questions.   6.B. The FDDI and ATM networks are ten times faster than the Ethernet networks. The measured round trip time for the small packets in the 100Mbps ATM system is lower relative to the 10Mbps Ethernet systems. However, the small packet round trip time on the 100Mbps FDDI is comparable to that of the 10Mbps Ethernet networks. What would you attribute this to?

Finding all decoded strings from a given input string that only consists of digit letters.  Implement a void function decodeWays function that decodes an input string, which consists of '0','1',..,'9', in all permissible ways.  [14 points]  The decodeWays has the following two parameters;   s: input string which consists of '0','1',..,'9'  and the first letter of s is not '0'  answer: an empty list   The decodeWays is a void function;  However, as a side-effect from the function, the answer must be filled with all the possible decoded strings in permissible ways in lexicographic order.      Explain the run-time and run-space complexity of the algorithm that you used for the implementation. [6 points]    Description    A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following: mapping:  'A' -> 1 'B' -> 2 ... 'Z' -> 26   Given a non-empty string containing only digits, find all the possible decoded strings.        Input Format    A string of digits.  Example input 1: s: "12"answer: [] Example input 2: s: "226"answer: []         Output    answer[] list which being filled with all permissible decoded strings.  For Example input "12": answer: ["AB", "L"] For Example input "226": answer: ["BBF", "BZ", "VF"]

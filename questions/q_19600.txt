4.  The purpose of this problem is to show your understanding of a multiplicative linear congruential generator.  The problem will walk you through the steps necessary to produce the first two random numbers that would be generated by a multiplicative LCG with a modulus of 101, a multiplier of 12 and an initial seed of 5.  (Remember that the initial seed does not yield a random number directly.)  You may choose any value for c (the increment) that would be appropriate for a multiplicative linear congruential generator whose modulus is 101. a.  What value of c will you use?  [increment] b.  If S0 = 5, what is S1?  [S1] c.  Given your answer to part b, what is R1?  [R1] d.  Given the value you have for S1, what is S2?  [S2]
Kevin was curious about seatbelts in cars. After a family drive one day, he performed an experiment. He created clay people of the same size to place on identical toy cars. Kevin then made a ramp by putting several books under one end of a board and rolled the cars down the ramp at the same time. One of his "passengers" was buckled into the toy car and the other passenger was not. Using this scenario, answer the following questions:  Develop a testable question that Kevin could have investigated. (1 point) What is the independent variable? (1/2 point) What is the dependent variable? (There may be more than one.) (1/2 point) Name 2 control variables present in Kevin's experiment. (1 point)

EXTRA CREDIT (2 points) List one similarity and one difference between the items listed below. If a term appears in parentheses after the pair, both your answers must be related to that term (e.g. if the term says "structure" your answer must relate to anatomy). Categorizations (e.g. "both are bones") and locations are not acceptable as answers. Your answer must address something specific to the items you are comparing. Vague answers (e.g. "contains cells") will receive less or no credit.   Skeletal muscle & cardiac muscle (structure)

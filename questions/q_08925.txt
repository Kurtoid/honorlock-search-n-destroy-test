Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow on the next page. Photojournalism: A Dangerous Job Journalists play an important role in modern society. They make sure that public has free and open access to information. However, when journalists cover stories in locations affected by war or natural disasters, their work can be dangerous. This work is hazardous for all journalists, but for photojournalists--photographers that cover the news--the job is especially dangerous. Reporters that write their stories can sometimes cover events from a distance. They can also find out about a story on the telephone or through Internet communication. Photojournalists, in contrast, must be right where the action and the danger are. Technology has changed the way photojournalists work. The first photojournalists appeared in the 1850s and 1860s during the Crimean War and the American Civil War. They took only still photographs, but during World War I, the photojournalists began taking moving pictures. In those days, the photojournalists' equipment is very light and portable. This allows journalists to move quickly and get very close to the action. They can transmit live videotape of a battle, a fire, or violent storm. Photographs are very influential and can often have a greater impact than words. They are particularly important today when people often don't have time to read a whole news story. Instead, they may just scan it quickly and look at the photographs that accompany the story. As a result of the increasing importance of photographs, photojournalists are under pressure to get the most impressive images. Photojournalists accept the risks of their job. It has sometimes been said that every photojournalist wants to find an image that will save a life or stop a war. That is probably not likely to happen, but there have been powerful photographs that have dramatically changed public opinion. Because today's photojournalists can cover their stories so closely, they sometimes find themselves in situations that they cannot control. As a result, many photojournalists are injured every year. Some of them die, mostly in war zones. In 2011, 34 journalists were killed while on the job, many of them photojournalists. There are also psychological risks. When they are photographing a dangerous or dramatic situation, many photojournalists feel a sense of conflict. Should they get the best picture or do they have a responsibility to help the person they are photographing? Some photojournalists say that this conflict is more difficult to manage than the physical danger. In the end, however, they say that if their photographs can change just one person's mind, then the risks are worthwhile.

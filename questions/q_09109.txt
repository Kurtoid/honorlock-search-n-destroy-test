The primary responsibility of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is to:
Let the function f : N - R be defined recursively as follows:      Initial Condition:  f (0) = 0Recursive Part:  f (n) = (2 * f (n-1)) + 1, for all n > 0 Consider how to prove the following statement about this given function f using induction. For all nonnegative integers n, f (n) = 2n- 1. Select the best response for each question below about how this proof by induction should be done.  Q1.  Which of the following would be a correct Basis step for this proof?   [Basis] A.  For n = k, assume f(k) = 2k - 1 for some integer k >= 0, so f(n) = 2n - 1 for n = k. B.  For n = 1, f(n) = f(1) = 2*f(0) +1 = 1; also 2n - 1 = 21 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1, so f(n) = 2n - 1 for n = 1. C.  For n = k+1, f(k+1) = 2(k+1) - 1 when f(k) = 2k - 1 for some integer k >= 0, so f(n) = 2n - 1 for n = k+1. D.  For n = 0, f(n) = f(0) = 0; also 2n - 1 = 20 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0, so f(n) = 2n - 1 for n = 0.  Q2.  Which of the following would be a correct Inductive Hypothesis for this proof?   [InductiveHypothesis] A.  Assume f(k+1) = 2(k+1) - 1 when f(k) = 2k - 1 for some integer k >= 0. B.  Assume f(k) = 2k - 1 for some integer k >= 0. C.  Prove f(k) = 2k - 1 for some integer k >= 0. D.  Prove f(k) = 2k - 1 for all integers k >= 0. Q3.  Which of the following would be a correct completion of the Inductive Step for this proof?   [InductiveStep] A.  f(k+1) = 2*f(k) + 1, which confirms the recursive part of the definition. B.  When f(k+1) = (2(k+1) - 1) = (2(k+1) - 2) + 1 = 2*(2k - 1) + 1; also f(k+1) = 2*f(k) + 1, so f(k) = (2k - 1), confirming the induction hypothesis. C.  When the inductive hypothesis is true, f(k+1) = 2*f(k) + 1 = 2*(2k - 1) + 1 = (2(k+1) - 2) + 1 = (2(k+1) - 1). D.  When the inductive hypothesis is true, f(k+1) = (2(k+1) - 1) = (2(k+1) - 2) + 1 = 2*(2k - 1) + 1 = 2*f(k) + 1, which confirms the recursive part of the definition. Q4.  Which of the following would be a correct conclusion for this proof?   [Conclusion] A.  By the principle of mathematical induction, f(n) = (2n - 1) for all integers n >= 0. B.  By the principle of mathematical induction, f(k) = f(k+1) for all integers k >= 0. C.  By the principle of mathematical induction, f(n+1) = (2*f(k)) + 1 for all integers n >= 0. D.  By the principle of mathematical induction, f(k) = (2k - 1) implies f(k+1) = (2(k+1) - 1) for all integers k >= 0.

A water line with a diameter of 6 cm has a pressure of 350 kPa gage and is situated at ground level. The water line rises to an elevation of 11 m above ground level and the diameter is then reduced to 3 cm. The pressure in the smaller line is measured to be 100 kPa gage. Assuming frictionless flow, what is the water velocity in the smaller line?

(Graduate students only and extra credit for undergraduate students) A 4-DOF robot frame is shown below (not symbolic diagram). Complete the table of Denavit-Hartenberg parameters and obtain the final position (x4, y4, z4) of the end-effector. Assume: 1) All angles are integer multiples of p/2, 2) all length dimensions di  , ai >= 0; and 3) all joint angles are in the range p > thi  >= - p (note upper limit).             Fill out the D-H parameter table based on the given conventions and rotations:     i   thi  di ai ai    0   --   --   [a0]   [alpha0]     1   [theta1]   [d1]   [a1]   [alpha1]     2   [theta2]   [d2]   [a2]   [alpha2]     3   [theta3]   [d3]   [a3]   [alpha3]     4   [theta4]   [d4]   --   --       Use the following D-H parameter conventions (modified version):  thi: angle between xi-1 and xi about zi di: min distance between xi-1 and xi along zi ai: min distance between zi and zi+1 along xi ai-1: angle between zi-1 and zi about xi-1

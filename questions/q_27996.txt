Joe's store is large with a lot of unused area. One day over lunch, Joe offers to rent Bob his unused area. With this new space, Bob can work on three automobiles at time and has easy access to auto parts and Joe will make money on his unused space. Both men are better off than they were before this deal.

A recent follow-up study on all persons who were in the sixth grade in the Happyville school system in 1999 found that of the 40 absent for ten or more days during their sixth grade school year, 11 did not obtain a high school diploma (or GED) as of 2010.  Of the 100 absent for less than ten days during their sixth grade school year, 10 did not obtain a high school diploma (or GED) as of 2010. *Given the hunch/belief that absenteeism in the early grades makes it difficult for students to keep up with the required work and is often a sign of other family issues that often pose challenges to academic progress of students,  formulate a hypothesis between the two specific variables of interest in this case.  *Using whether or not the student obtained a high school diploma (or GED) as the dependent variable, construct a crosstab/contingency table for assessing the relationship between whether or not obtained a high school diploma (or GED) and absence level in the sixth grade.   (Note: you don't need a perfectly drawn table;  just be sure to present the appropriate numbers and percentages with appropriately labelled columns and rows or the equivalent) *From an appropriate test of statistical significance, the p-value for the above display is .01;  in the context of this display what does this mean (include brief reference to two of the percentages as part of this answer)? *Given the above data, are the statistical results so far consistent or inconsistent with the hypothesis?
The average voter turnout at a certain polling location in the 2016 presidential election was 102 voters per hour. A poll worker is planning for this year's election. She believes that interest in this year's election is high, which would tend to increase turnout, but she also believes that concerns about safety due to the coronavirus pandemic are also high, and that this would tend to decrease turnout. She is uncertain about which factor will have the most effect on turnout. Which hypotheses capture the competing beliefs in this scenario?

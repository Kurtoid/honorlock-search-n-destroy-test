BONUS - 15 points The amount of ascorbic acid (FM 176.12) in a sample can be determined by iodometric titration. A 10.00-mL aliquot of a solution with an unknown ascorbic acid concentration was first pipetted into an Erlenmeyer flask, along with 5 mL of 5% KI solution and 1.5 mL of 6 M H2SO4. The mixture was then titrated rapidly with 1.897 mM KIO3 solution while swirling the flask between additions, until the yellow color of the  complex almost persisted. Then four drops of starch indicator were added and the titration continued until the blue color of the starch-iodine complex persisted. The total amount of KIO3 solution used was 38.72 mL.  Report the ascorbic acid concentration in mg ascorbic acid/100 mL solution. IO3- + 8I- + 6H+  3I3- + 3H2O Ascorbic acid + I3- + H2O  dehydroascorbate + 3I- + 2H+

You run a business that will supply natural gas to customers in Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, and Pensacola from distribution centers (DCs). You have three candidate DC locations to choose from (Gainesville, Lake City, and Tallahassee). Each DC has a capacity restriction that limits the number of units of gas it can supply. Each customer city has a demand that should be satisfied.  Develop a single integer linear programming formulation that (when solved) will determine which DC's to open and allocate DC capacity to the customers so as to minimize total distribution costs plus the fixed costs of the DC's that are opened. The per unit cost of shipping one unit of natural gas from each DC to each customer is shown in the table below, along with the demand and capacity levels. The fixed costs for DC's opened in Gainesville, Lake City, and Tallahassee are $3000, $4500, and $4000, respectively. [Do not solve the problem. Just provide the formulation without any attempt to reduce complexity by solving (or partially solving) the problem.].

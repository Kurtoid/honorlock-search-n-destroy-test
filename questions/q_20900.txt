Shauna owns a lovely 3 unit apartment building in old Ottawa south.  For many years she has been renting two of the apartments to professors from the university (Shauna lives in the 3rd and biggest unit).  For the first time in many years both of her tenants gave notice to vacate (she was sad to see them go).  Shauna re-rented the unit to two groups of two university students.  They seemed like very nice and respectful young people.  Unfortunately, on homecoming weekend the tenants in both of the units behaved intolerably.  The tenants and their guests (about 10 people), drank excessively.  They pitched alcohol containers in to the yard, used the back yard as toilet facilities and became sick in the flower beds (trampling Shauma's prize plants).  Some of the guests accessed the flat roof (via the fire escape) to sing and act like fools for the students on the road rushing past to the football game.  Shauna asked the guests to get off the roof and she was rudely told off, booed, and someone even made an offensive gesture.  Shauna felt traumatized and has horrible feelings about her new tenants and no longer wants to be a landlord.  She approached them the next day and they apologized sheepishly while at the same time suggesting that it was a good party (mostly) and that they would pay for any damage.  In fact, the tenants offered Shauna a $1000 damage deposit in case anything else got damaged in future parties.  Shauna consults you with the hope of permanently ending this nightmare.

Hair color is determined in Labrador retrievers by alleles at the B and E loci. A dominant allele B encodes black pigment, whereas a recessive allele b encodes brown pigment. Alleles at a second locus affect the deposition of the pigment in the shaft of the hair; dominant allele E allows dark pigment (black or brown) to be deposited, whereas recessive allele e prevents the deposition of dark pigment, causing the hair to be yellow. A black female Labrador retriever was mated with a yellow male. 3/8 of the puppies were  black 1/8 brown and half were yellow. If the genotype of the black female parent was Bb Ee, then what was the genotype of the other parent?
Two phenotypically normal sisters with teratoma and gonadoblastoma underwent laboratory investigations to determine the reason for their observed phenotypes.  RT-PCR was performed on mRNA isolated from gonadal tissue to determine the mRNA expression of SRY (Panel A), DAX-1 (Panel B), SOX9 (Panel C), and SF1 (Panel E) in the sisters (1 & 2) and a normal 46, XY individual as a control (C).  The results were normalized to the expression of 18S rRNA in the sample. FISH revealed that the patients had a 46,XY SRY+ karyotype. Comparative genomic hybridization revealed that the genetic dose of SOX9, SF-1, and SRY was normal, and the dose of DAX-1 exons was duplicated. Which of the following options best explains the phenotype in these sisters?         A Increased DAX-1 expression resulted in gonadal dysgenesis and 46, XY female phenotype   B Increased SRY expression resulted in gonadal dysgenesis and 46, XY female phenotype   C Decreased SOX9 levels resulted in gonadal dysgenesis and 46, XY development   D Decreased SF1 levels resulted in gonadal dysgenesis and 46, XY development

Questions 15-21 are in one set.        General Motors Company (GM) designs, builds and sells cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts. The company is considering increasing production of the Freebird sedan at one of their Michigan assembly plants.  You have been provided the following pieces of information.  The expansion will require the purchase of machinery costing $30 million. The firm has spent $0.8 million to train workers to use the new machinery. The sales from this project will be $20 million per year, of which 20% comes from lost sales of the TXI sedan. The project of launching of the new sedan will experience a manufacturing cost of $7 million every year from year 1 to year 10. The company uses straight-line depreciation and the depreciation is $3 million per year for 10 years of the project's life. It expects that the equipment will be sold for $2 million at the end of year 10. To date, the company also spent $2 million for research and development of the sedan. The firm has already paid a consulting company $0.5 million for analysis of the U.S. sedan market. Because of the project, the company will need additional working capital of $1.5 million when starting the project, which can be liquidated at the end of 10 years. GM's stock information is shown in the picture above, with a beta=1.31. The market risk premium is 6% and the risk free rate is 2%. The before-tax cost of debt for GM is 4.5045%. GM's marginal tax rate is 40%. Their target capital structure is 70% equity and 30% debt.  Please use the above information for Questions 15-21. What is the most accurate WACC of this project? [Please keep four decimal places, e.g., for percentage numbers: 1.0001%]

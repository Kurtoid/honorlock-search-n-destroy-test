Fact Pattern 5 21. Lisa and Andy got married in Lisa's hometown in Ohio and then moved to Nice, France.  Their child, Isla, was born in Nice, though the family took frequent trips to Ohio to visit family for several weeks at a time (all of Lisa's extended family lived there).  While Lisa struggled to master her French, the parties enrolled Isla in preschool and engaged in playdates with other neighbor families in an effort for their child to become bilingual.  Lisa often asked the child's pediatrician to speak slowly during appointments so that she could better understand her instructions.   Lisa didn't like that the family moved from apartment to apartment every six months, but she did enjoy the rose on the parties' small balcony. Shortly after Isla's third birthday, Lisa's mother was diagnosed with cancer.  Distraught, the parties agreed that mother and child would stay in northeast Ohio for an extended period of time to help Lisa's mother during her treatment.  During this time, the child was able to spend lots of time with her grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.  To keep Isla busy, Lisa enrolled her in a ballet class. After spending six months in the United States, Lisa informed Andy during a phone call that she missed northeast Ohio winters, was sick of the sunshine and balmy weather of southern France, and wasn't returning to France with their daughter.  If you represent Andy, outline and analyze your best arguments in favor of a return order under the Hague Convention of 1980? (3 points; 200 words)

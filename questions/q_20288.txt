Be sure to answer all parts of this question. Surfaces of aircraft parts must be coated with a primer paint before a finish paint is applied. The purpose of the primer is to improve paint adhesion. A project team ran an experiment using three different methods (dipping, normal spraying, and electrostatic painting) to investigate the effect of coating method on adhesion force, . Four sample parts were coated with each method, a finish paint was applied, and the adhesion force was measured. The team wants to know whether the average adhesion force is the same for different coating methods. Results from the experiment are below.    Coating Method Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4   Dipping 5.4 4.9 5.6 5.3   Normal Spraying 5.8 6.1 6.3 6.0   Electrostatic Painting 5.5 5.0 5.0 5.2      State the null hypothesis for this experiment, H0. State the alternative hypothesis, H1. Which statistical method would you use to test these hypotheses?

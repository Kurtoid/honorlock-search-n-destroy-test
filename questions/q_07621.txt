Solve the system of equations using the graphing calculator. Fill In the Blank: If the system is consistent/independent write your answer as (x,y,z).  If the system is consistent/dependent write your answer as an ordered triple using only variable z. If the system is inconsistent write "no solution".     -3x - 7y + 7z =  71  -2x + 7y - 3z = -22 -3x - 9y  + 9z =  87

Use the factor-label method to solve the following stoichiometry problem.   Given the following equation:  1 C3H8  +  5 O2    3 CO2  +  4 H2O If 25.7 g of CO2 are produced from this reaction, how many moles of H2O are also produced? To receive full credit:  You must use the factor unit method and the math equation editor in the tool bar to insert the stoichiometric calculation.  Show your work (conversion factors/and units) by using the equation editor () in the toolbar.  If necessary, use the the three vertical dots to expand the toolbar. Within the equation editor, use     to insert conversion factors. Be sure to include proper units and the final answer! Or, show your work on a separate sheet of paper and submit in the Unit 2 Exam pictures dropbox after completing the Exam.

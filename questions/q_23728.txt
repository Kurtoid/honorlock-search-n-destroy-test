For your final examination, you should write a cohesive, well-developed essay that fully addresses the essay prompt. Please closely read the following CQ Researcher articles (published December 2, 2011 (volume 21, issue 42)) and then the prompt below.     "Digital Education-Should Schools Use as Much Digital Technology as They Can Afford: Pro"by Curt Bonk, Professor of Instructional Systems Technology at Indiana University   "Digital Education-Should Schools Use as Much Digital Technology as They Can Afford: Con"by Paul Thomas, Associate Professor of Education at Furman University     par. 1Despite persistent budget dilemmas and constraints, this is no time to ban, control, limit or passively ignore possible uses of technology in teaching and learning. Instead, it should be an age filled with heavy doses of learning-technology experimentation and creative initiatives. With proper planning, discussion and evaluation, there is much that technology dollars can afford, even for the smallest or most impoverished school or district. par. 2A couple of years ago, I authored the book The World Is Open: How Web Technology Is Revolutionizing Education. In it, I detailed many free and openly available resources for learning. With careful budgeting, laptops, tablet computers such as the iPad or other hardware can be acquired and embedded with a wide range of free tools and applications for learning basic mathematics, spelling, grammar and scientific concepts. par. 3Is that not enough? Then have students explore learning portals containing the works of Shakespeare, Darwin, Einstein, Jane Austen, Jane Goodall, the Dalai Lama and other major historical figures. For those concerned about resource quality, such contents are often created by NASA, the U.S. government, the Smithsonian, National Geographic, the United Nations, MIT, Berkeley, and many other reputable sources. par. 4Digital technologies offer much hope to learners and educators today. Students can be inspired by mentors and role models from all corners of the Earth. Feedback on one's ideas can be received in the early morning hours or late at night. E-books can be loaded into mobile devices that can represent events through simulations, animations, videos and hyperlinked text. par. 5Web technology situates students in authentic contexts analyzing real world data and interacting with their global peers about the results of their investigations. If this requires a cheap $20 membership in some service that fosters such expert advice or interaction, that is $20 well spent. Ditto the tens of thousands of dollars many school districts are spending today on iPads and other learning technologies. par. 6Effective learning requires an environment designed for multiple paths to success. In the 21st century, digital technologies enhance the learning opportunities for untold millions of learners. Now is the time to move ahead, not retrench or retrace.   par. 1Technology represents the essence of American consumerism by feeding our popular clamor for acquiring the current hot thing. Yet the ever-increasing significance of technology in our daily lives and its contribution to powerful advances as well as a widening equity gap place education in a complex paradox. par. 2Two experiences from my 18 years teaching high school English inform my belief that schools should not incorporate as much digital technology as finances allow. I began teaching in the 1980s during the rise of MTV and witnessed my field make a claim that text was dead, and thus English teaching had to shift to the brave new video world--failing to anticipate instant messaging, email, texting, blogging and the text-rich social-media boom. par. 3The intersection of technology's unknowable future, its inflated costs, and its inevitable obsolescence must give us pause as we spend public funds. Let me suggest simply looking into the closets and storage facilities at schools across the United States, where cables, monitors and other artifacts costing millions of dollars lie useless, replaced by the next-best thing we then had to acquire. In fact, just think of one thing, the Laserdisc video player (soon to be joined by interactive "smart" whiteboards in those closets). par. 4Chalkboard, marker board, interactive board--this sequence has not insured better teaching or learning, but has guaranteed greater costs for schools and profits for manufacturers. par. 5The foundational principles of public education for democracy and human agency must not fall prey to preparing children for the future by perpetually acquiring new technology because we can never know that future. Thus, we must not squander public funds on ever-changing technology but instead focus on the human interaction that is teaching and learning as well as the critical literacy and numeracy every child needs. We can anticipate only one fact of our futures--change.     _____________________________________________________________________________________ Topic: Using the above-noted articles, "Digital Education-Should Schools Use as Much Digital Technology as They Can Afford: Pro" and "Digital Education-Should Schools Use as Much Digital Technology as They Can Afford: Con," as reference sources, write an essay in which you analyze each author's use of one rhetorical tool or rhetorical appeal to achieve his or her specific purpose.  To start, determine what you believe is each author's specific purpose. Choose one of the following specific purposes for each author: to convince, to justify, to validate, to condemn, to expose, to incite, to celebrate, to defend, or to question. Then, determine which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Pro" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose and then which one of the following rhetorical tools or rhetorical appeals the "Con" author relies upon most heavily in his or her article to achieve his or her specific purpose. You must choose both tools and/or appeals from the following list:    alliteration amplification allusions analogy arrangement/organization authorities/outside sources definitions diction (and/or loaded diction) enthymeme examples facts irony paradox parallelism refutation rhetorical questions statistics testimony tone logos pathos ethos kairos     Organize your ideas into a four-paragraph essay that includes the following paragraphs: (paragraph 1) an introduction paragraph; (paragraphs 2 and 3) two separate, well-developed rhetorical tools and/or rhetorical appeals body paragraphs (one focused on the "Pro" author's use of your chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose and the other focused on the "Con" author's use of your other chosen rhetorical tool or appeal to achieve his/her specific purpose); and (paragraph 4) a conclusion paragraph. Your essay must include a forecasting thesis statement and effective topic and concluding sentences in each body paragraph. At least four times in your essay, you also must correctly integrate quotations, paraphrases, and/or summaries from the above-noted articles; remember to include proper in-text citations.

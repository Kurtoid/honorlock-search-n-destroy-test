Globus Autos sells a single product. 8,100 units were sold resulting in $80,000 of sales revenue, $25,000 of variable costs,and $14,000 of fixed costs. If variable costs decrease by $1.10 per unit, the new margin of safety is __________. (Round intermediate calculations to the nearest cent.)               A. $80,000           B. $66,000           C. $62,500           D. $25,000                       First, find the old breakeven point in sales:   Sales     Contribution margin     - Variable costs     / Sales     Contribution margin   $0 Contribution margin percentage #DIV/0!               Fixed costs           / Contribution margin percentage     #DIV/0!     Breakeven point in sales $     #DIV/0!                 Next, find the new breakeven point in sales:   Sales           -New Variable costs     (25000-(8,100*1.1))     New Contribution margin   $0       / Sales           New Contrinution margin %   #DIV/0!                   Fixed cost   $14,000       / New Contribution margin %   #DIV/0!       Breakeven in sales   #DIV/0!                   Finally, find the margin of safety:   Actual revenue - Breakeven in sales = Margin of safety     - #DIV/0! = #DIV/0!           Difference is due to rounding in intermediate steps

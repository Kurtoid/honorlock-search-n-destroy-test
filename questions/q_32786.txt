What is the name of the tectonic cycle that results in the formation of a supercontinent?
6. [30 points] A backhoe with a 2-cy bucket will be used for excavating the basement of a building. The dimensions of the basement are 200 ft wide, 450 ft long and 9 ft deep. The earth is hard, tough clay. The backhoe will load earth into 18-cy, loose measure, trucks that will haul the earth 15 miles to a waste dump. The average haul speed will be 30 mi/hr and return speed of 45 mi/hr. For each truck assume a fixed time of 5 min to dump a load and wait at the basement area to be loaded. The cost of the backhoe, with operator is $105.00/hr and the cost of each truck, with driver, is $65.00/hr. Assume a 45-min effective hour for the loading and hauling operation. Estimate: a. Quantity of work (lcy) [6 points] b. Production rate of backhoe (lcy/hr). Note: You need to consider the fill factor of the backhoe buckets [6 points] c. Cycle time of one truck (hr/trip) [6 points] d. Number of truck required to balance the production rate of backhoe [6 points] e. How many truck should be used to minimize the unit cost of labor ($/lcy)? [6 points]

Which is not a basic requirement for a self-sustaining ecosystem?
Use the following information to answer the question.Giardia intestinalis can cause disease in several different mammalian species, including humans. Giardia organisms (G. intestinalis) that infect humans are similar morphologically to those that infect other mammals, thus they have been considered a single species. However, G. intestinalis has been divided into different subgroups based on their host and a few other characteristics.In 1999, a DNA sequence comparison study tested the hypothesis that these subgroups actually constitute different species. The following phylogenetic tree was constructed from the sequence comparison of rRNA from several subgroups of G. intestinalis and a few other morphologically distinct species of Giardia. The researchers concluded that the subgroups of Giardia are sufficiently different from one another genetically that they could be considered different species. (T. Monis, et al. 1999. Molecular systematics of the parasitic protozoan Giardia intestinalis. Mol. Biol. Evol. 16[9]:1135-44.)According to the phylogenetic tree in the figure above, G. intestinalis constitutes a ________ group.

You run a business that will supply natural gas to customers in Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, and Pensacola from distribution centers (DCs). You have three candidate DC locations to choose from (Gainesville, Lake City, and Tallahassee). Each DC has a capacity restriction that limits the number of units of gas it can supply. Each customer city has a demand that should be satisfied.  Develop a single integer linear programming formulation that (when solved) will determine which DC's to open and allocate DC capacity to the customers so as to minimize total distribution costs plus the fixed costs of the DC's that are opened. The per unit cost of shipping one unit of natural gas from each DC to each customer is shown in the table below, along with the demand and capacity levels. The fixed costs for DC's opened in Gainesville, Lake City, and Tallahassee are $3000, $4500, and $4000, respectively. [Do not solve the problem. Just provide the formulation without any attempt to reduce complexity by solving (or partially solving) the problem.].     Tampa Orlando Jacksonville Pensacola Capacity   Gainesville $1.40 $0.95 $1.55 $3.25 1200   Lake City $1.55 $1.40 $1.20 $2.80 1800   Tallahassee $1.90 $1.75 $1.80 $2.15 1600           Demand 800 700 500 600

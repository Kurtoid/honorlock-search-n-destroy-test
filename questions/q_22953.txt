7.  In determining the number of documents to select for a test to obtain assurance that all sales have been properly authorized, an auditor should consider the tolerable rate of deviation from the control activity.  The auditor should also consider the:      I.  Allowable risk of assessing control risk too high.     II.  Likely rate of deviation.
From control point I, distance (D=56.8 ft) and azimuth (Az=240 deg) of a line I-J were observed and coordinates of point J computed.   Given different combinations of standard deviations of Az and D below, and assuming that coordinates of point I are error free, check the correct range for correlations r between departure error and latitude error at point J. Note: Getting the answers does not require any computations! a)

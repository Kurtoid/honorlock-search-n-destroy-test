Write the solution (include all steps) to this problem on a piece of paper.  Once completed, hold the solution so I can see it on-camera for at least 3 seconds.  After you submit this exam, you will scan and submit the problems work as a single PDF document to the corresponding dropbox in eCampus for this exam.  The problems you submit to the dropbox must exactly match the problems shown on-camera.  If not, the grade for this exam will be a zero.  You may use an approved non-CAS calculator on this exam.  Solve the logarithmic equation.  You must show work for credit.  ln(x)+5=13{"version":"1.1","math":"ln(x)+5=13"}

Use the following information to answer the questions below A sheep breeder has maintained very careful records from a series of crosses involving two traits. One trait is the height of black hairs above the hooves. This trait has two phenotypes: black extending approximately 12cm above the hooves (Full Black = F) and black only 3 - 4cm above the hooves (Short Black = S).  It is clear from the breeder's data that leg hair height follows a simple Mendelian pattern with Full dominant to Short (F -> S).  Unfortunately, the breeder is having a little more trouble understanding the second trait (Coat Color: White - W and Cream - C).  He has obtained the same results many times from his crosses. And Reciprocal crosses always gave identical results. Here is one example where he crossed his prize winning female (known to be homozygous at both loci) with a male.  All the offspring survived (no lethal alleles).

Salmon live in both fresh water and salt water during their lives. They are born in in fresh water but migrate out to marine waters for most of their life. Eventually, they return to the place they were born in fresh water to spawn. Changing between fresh water and salt water affects the balance of water in their body. Salmon have an internalcontrol system called osmoregulationthatrestores the balance by negative feedback. This is an example of which characteristic of life?

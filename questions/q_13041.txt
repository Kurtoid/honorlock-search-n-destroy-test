4. A light beam of wavelength 0.6 mm travels along the y-axis with its electric field vector of amplitude 600V/cm directed along the x-axis. Use one of the Maxwell's equations to determine the direction and amplitude of the magnetic field. Determine the frequency. If the reflectivity from a material surface for normal incidence from air is 25%, determine the refractive index of the material. If the electric   field amplitude of the incident beam is 500 V/cm determine the electric field amplitude of the reflected beam. With a diagram discuss how a liquid-level sensor based on total internal reflection works.     (c = 3x108 m/s,  1mm = 10-6 m,  mo = 4p x 10-7 weber/(amp.-m),   eo = 8.85x10-12 Coul2/N-m2)

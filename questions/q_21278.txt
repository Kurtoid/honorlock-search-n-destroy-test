Question 24.  Lawyer Leo is counsel for Buster Jeeben, a pop star who is trying to break into the clothing design field.  Jeeben has designed a new line of temporary tattoos and is attempting to negotiate an exclusive licensing deal with one of six major retailers.  Lawyer Leo has been reaching out to retailers all month, but only half of the retailers have even returned his calls.  Moreover, to date, only two retailers have engaged in any negotiations: Bullseye and J-Mart.  In opening negotiations, J-Mart has offered Jeeben $2 million for exclusive rights to the tattoo line.  However, Jeeben tells Leo that he thinks that Bullseye is a much cooler store and would therefore be willing to do the deal with Bullseye for as little as $1 million.  Assuming Jeeben has authorized Lawyer Leo to negotiate with Bullseye as Leo sees fit, for which of the following statements would Lawyer Leo be subject to discipline? I. Telling Bullseye, "We're excited about all the interest we've had from your competitors" when Jeeben is actually disappointed about the level of interest. II. Telling Bullseye that J-Mart has offered $2 million, so Bullseye will need to make a higher offer if it wants the deal. III. Telling Bullseye, "You'd better start with your top offer, because we want to wrap up the deal quickly" when neither Jeeben nor J-Mart has suggested there are time constraints. IV. Telling Bullseye that J-Mart has offered $4 million, so Bullseye will need to make a higher offer if it wants the deal.   A. All of the above B. Choices I, III, and IV only. C. Choices III and IV only. D. Choice IV only. E. None of the above.

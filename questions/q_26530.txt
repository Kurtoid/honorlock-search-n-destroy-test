Blackmer Industries is a publicly-traded automobile parts manufacturer with revenues of about $127 million  in its last fiscal year (Year 0). Blackmer has been approached by a potential new client that would substantially increase revenue in the next two years and believes they may need additional funding to support the growth. They have asked Inland Bank to provide them with a line of credit.  The historical financial statements for the company (FY 0) are included in the Exam Exhibits file (the link is in the instructions). The CEO has asked you to  prepare a two-year forecast.  You have met with the various operational managers of the company, done your research, and collected the following assumptions:  Revenue growth will be 26% for Year 1 and 23% for Year 2. The new client will have volume discounts so Gross Margin will decline to 35% for the forecast period. Operating expenses (which include depreciation) are 25% of Revenue. The interest rate on all debt will be 6%. Interest each year is calculated based on the average of year-end debt balances from the current year and the previous year. The company will maintain a cash balance of $2.5 million each year. The new customer has requested favorable terms for payment and also wants Blackmer to carry a higher level of inventory. Because of this, Accounts Receivable (A/R) Collection days will increase by ten (10) days over Year 0, and Inventory days on hand will increase by five (5) days over Year 0.  Accounts Payable (A/P) days will stay constant at the historical levels for the forecast period.  Net Property and Equipment will increase by 30% in Year 1 and 20% in Year 2. For Year 1 and Year 2, the payments on long-term debt will be $1.5 million.  Prepare a 'base-case' two-year forecast for Blackmer using the assumptions given. Assume additional funding needs will come from the Inland line of credit. The amount of  total assets forecasted for Year 1 are  ____. Please round your answer to the nearest dollar and do not include dollar signs or commas, for example $125,455 should be input at 125455.   Hint:   You can use the Jones Case Excel template with some minor modifications.   If you use this template,  check the formulas to be sure they conform to the assumptions given in the exam question.  Note that you have to compute the AR days, Inv Days, and AP days in Yr 0 to calculate the the assumption for these accounts in Yr 1 and Yr 2 as provided above.

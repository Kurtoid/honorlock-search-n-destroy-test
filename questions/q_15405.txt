Problem No. 2 Shown below is a diving board that is supported by springs at A and B.   A boy with a mass of 60-kg stands at the free end of the board as shown. The spring constant (stiffness) of both springs k=60 kN/m. The board is assumed to be rigid, i.e. it remain straight at all times (does not curve). Before the boy stepping on the board it was perfectly horizontal. Take g=9.807 m/s^2 and neglect the weight of the board.  Based on this information answer the following question: Question 2.8: What is the displacement of the free end of the board (i.e the position of the boy)? [Enter value in mm, upwards as positive]

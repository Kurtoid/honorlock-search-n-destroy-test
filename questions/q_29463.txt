Red-green color blindness is a recessive X-linked characteristic. X+ represent an allele for normal vision and XC represents an allele for red-green colorblindness. Jessica, who is homozygous for normal vision, and Nick, who is colorblind, have a son. Their son then has a child with a woman who is homozygous for color blindness. What is the percentage probability that their child is cololorblind? (I'm asking about Jessica's and Nick's grandchild) Write your answer as a percentage (just the number).

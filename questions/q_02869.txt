Question 2-11: An intersection is operated on fix time control of cycle length of 100s. The effective green time for phase 2 is 30s. The traffic volume is 540vph and the vehicle arrivals perfectly at a fixed time interval. The saturated flow rate is 1800vphpl. One lane for phase 2. At 8:00, the red starts, and no vehicles at the stop bar. Apply D/D/1 queue to find out: All-time related answers are in seconds

Let's imagine you are studying the golden poison frogs, Phyllobates terribilis, which are endemic to the Pacific coast of Colombia. It is among the most poisonous animals and each frog produces 1 mg of batrachotoxin, "enough to kill about 10,000 mice. This estimate will vary..., but most agree this dose is enough to kill between 10 and 20 humans". Just one frog! You are studying a different locus, though, to estimate its risk as endangered species. This locus has two alleles. In the population you are studying, you counted 75 individuals homozygous TT, 83 individuals heterozygotes Tt, and 11 individuals homozygous tt. Determine the allele frequency of the dominant allele. (Please use and estimate to 5 decimal points for all your calculations)

To obtain the 5 bonus points associated with this assignment, you need to read the following statements, and then select "I have read, understand and agree with the statements above". I have completed the sample HonorLock quiz and ensured that my computer system, webcam and microphone are sufficient to allow me to take my Accounting exams on Canvas using HonorLock. I understand the following:  While taking exams on Canvas through HonorLock:  I must be in a dedicated area working at a table or desk. I cannot take my exam sitting on a couch or in bed. I must show all of the following at the beginning of my exam session: my face, my picture ID, a COMPLETE 360 degree room scan that includes my work space, my one sheet of scratch paper, my basic 4-function calculator and the wall behind my computer. Items not allowed during exam: phone, smart watch, hat, sunglasses. I am not allowed to leave the room once I begin the exam. Also, no one is allowed to enter the room. Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid exam and a grade of zero. It may also result in a case of academic dishonesty.  To make the process smoother, I will keep my hands off my face. The program will freeze and pause the exam whenever my face is not clearly visible. That has the potential to greatly disrupt my exam time.

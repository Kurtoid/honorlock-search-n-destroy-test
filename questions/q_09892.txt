I will have 70 minutes (1 hour & 10 minutes) to work on the exam; starting from when I first open it.   I will be unable to make any more changes after 70 minutes OR after 5:30 pm on Wed, Feb 24, whichever comes first.  Once I exit the exam, I will NOT be able to log back in on my own.
For Questions 12~15: Signal Timing Design A four-phase intersection originally has three lanes for each approach: dedicated left (L), through (T), and through-right (T+R). The lane width for each lane is 12 ft and speed for all approach is 50mph. Assume level grade and lost start-up time of 2 seconds per phase. The layout, adjusted volumes, lane groupings, and saturation flows are as following.      NB   SB   EB   WB     L   T   T+R   L   T   T+R   L   T   T+R   L   T   T+R     200   420   285   250   300   260   180   525   475   220   550   458         Phasing: * Phase A: North-south left * Phase B: North-south through/through-right * Phase C: East-west left * Phase D: East-west through/through-right:   Saturation flow rates: *Left turns: 1580 pc/ln/h *Through: 1750 pc/ln/h *Through/right: 1800 pc/ln/h *Right turns: 1680 pc/ln/h     To improve the safety for bicyclists, the lane width for each lane has been reduced by 1ft (the total widths of the intersection keep the same) and the posted speed for all approach has been reduced by 5mph. If the above traffic volumes are unchanged but all the saturation flow rates have been reduced to 95% of original values due to the smaller lane width, answer the following questions.

At the beginning of your answer, identify the genre and general time period of each author, by century (were they 16th, 17th, 18th, or 19th?) -1 for each missing or incorrect century or genre.  Essay Question   Discuss the work of Las Casas and Rowlandson. Note: you're not being asked to discuss the author's biography. To receive credit,  answer with reference to their assigned writing from this class. First, discuss the rhetoric employed by Casas: in his writing, how did he attempt to convince his audience that the exploitation of indigenous Americans should be ended? Cite as many examples as you can remember, always noting the effect these examples had on his writing. What other rhetorical strategies did he employ? Then, compare his work with the Narrative of Mary Rowlandson. What were their differing attitudes towards Indigenous Americans? How did this manifest in their language?  Remember: extra credit may be offered to students who write an especially specific, thoughtful, well-constructed essay.    OR (if you'd prefer another option): Compare Anne Bradstreet's literary work to the work of Edward Taylor. Do you see any similarities between the literary works of these writers? What are the key differences?  Be sure to note the dominant subject matter of their work. In your discussion, support your points with reference to at least 2 works by Bradstreet;   1 work by Taylor. (If you forget the name of a specific work, you can describe it.)      Note: Your answer must draw from the assigned readings in the course. You're being asked about the author's assigned writing, NOT about their lives.
Data from Walt Disney World's website indicates an average of about 53,000 visitors per day at their park. Suppose on the 4th of July, 2019, there were 56,000 visitors at Walt Disney World (WDW), and I sent out a research team to randomly sample 1,000 visitors at WDW that day. 40% of those sampled said they had been to WDW at least once before that day. The average age of those sampled was 32. Suppose 55% of the tickets sold that day were adult admission tickets. a. Identify the population in this study (who, where, and how many).[population] b.

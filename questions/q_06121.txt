One of the key assumptions that must be met in order to use the confidence interval equations is that the sample data must come from a normally distributed variable. What type of plot should you make to determine if it is plausible that the sample data comes from a normally distributed variable? [normality] b. The appropriate plots show that the data is normally distributed and that there are no outliers. Use the known population standard deviation of 3 hours to calculate a two-sided 98% confidence interval for the true average curing time of this adhesive. Lower Bound [LB] Upper Bound [UB] c. Interpret the results. [interpretation]

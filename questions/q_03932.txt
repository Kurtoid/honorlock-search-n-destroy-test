Reading Comprehension: Read the article below and answer the questions that follow.  The Power of Advertising 1 P1 Advertising is all around us, every day. It's on TV, radio, the Internet, and the sides of roads and buildings. Advertisers are always looking for new settings for ads and new methods to increase our awareness of brands. They see potential for ads almost everywhere. Now you can see advertising for products and brands on athletes' uniforms and on the sides of buses. There are now ads on tray tables on airline seats. There have even been ads on manhole[1] covers in the middle of streets.  P2 There are different estimates for how much advertising we see or hear in a given day. Some say that the average person is exposed to anywhere from 250 to 800 ads per day. Other estimates suggest that we see or hear as many as 3,000 advertising messages in one day. Either way, there is no doubt that we are all exposed to a lot of advertising. Advertisers know that repetition of advertising messages is essential if they want consumers remember their brands. It is every company's mission to make sure their brand comes to mind when you first think of a certain type of product.  P3 We accept that advertising is all around us. As adults we assume that we aren't influenced too much. We feel we can disregard messages that we don't like. And we can always refuse to watch or listen to an ad by turning off the TV or blocking advertising on our computers. But what about children? How does so much advertising influence them? Many experts have concerns about this. Some question the ethics of advertising that focuses on children.  P4 Depending on how much TV they watch, children may be exposed to as much advertising as adults. Studies show that children see an average of 40,000 TV commercials per year. It doesn't stop with TV. Children also see more and more advertising on the Internet because advertisers always work to catch up with new technologies and use them.  P5 Companies spend billions of dollars on advertising aimed at children. Recently, they also have been targeting children at younger ages. Research shows that companies focus on children as young as two years old. Companies hope that if they create brand awareness for children when they are young, children will be loyal to the brands throughout their lives. Many people have concerns about this.  P6 Studies show that children under eight years old may not be able to tell the difference between advertising and regular programming on TV. They may not understand that a company wants to sell them something. This is especially true if a company uses a well-known character such as a cartoon character to sell a product.  P7 Children seem to be able to remember ads easily. Studies show that a child can have a preference for a certain product after seeing only one ad for the product. And the strength of the preference goes up when they see advertisements repeatedly. Of course, children don't see only the ads for children. They also see ads aimed at adults. So that means they see and may remember ads for products like alcohol and tobacco, too.  P8 Much of the advertising aimed at children tries to sell toys and unhealthy food. A study in the United Kingdom found that children who see a lot of ads for junk food on TV almost twice as much unhealthy food as those who don't see a lot of ads. If a child is already overweight, the risk is even higher. As a result of this research, many people in the UK want stricter standards and regulation on junk food advertising.  P9 Experts say that parents should educate children about advertising. They suggest that parents watch TV with their children and discuss the commercials. Parents can explain how advertising works and help children understand what companies are trying to do. By doing this, parents can help their children be more aware of the effects of advertising. And they can help them be better consumers.

At a certain temperature the equilibrium constant, Kc, equals 0.11 for the reaction: 2 ICl(g) = I2(g) + Cl2(g). What is the equilibrium concentration of ICl if 0.45 mol of I2 and 0.45 mol of Cl2 are initially mixed in a 2.0-L flask?

In the parallel system illustrated in the sketch, Q1 = Q2 = 3 cfs and Q3 = 6 cfs.  The only head losses are due to the devices in lines 1, 2, and 3.    If the fluid density is 60 lbm/ft3, what is the change in pressure from a to b?  (Note that the work of the pump is equivalent to the change in head from a to b since the only losses are due to devices.) Put the number only into the answer box.  The number value should be the magnitude corresponding to units of psf. If necessary, use decimal form, not fractions.

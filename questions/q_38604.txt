Figure 1(a) shows a circuit containing a random logic which is implemented using built-in self-testing (BIST) circuits. The system clock rate is 3GHz, and STUMPS BIST design is used. Assume the random logic contains 30 scan chains for BIST, 12 of them contain 90 scan cells in each scan chain, and 18 of them contain 100 scan cells in each scan chain. Assume the shift speed is 200MHz, and 45000 random test patterns are required to detect most of the single stuck-at faults.    (a) What is the test time required using the BIST design given above. Note that the time required for scanning in the seeds and scanning out the signature for PRSR and MISR must be considered. (b) If test per clock (i.e., a test is performed for each test clock) is used for this STUMPS BIST architecture, what problem will occur? (c) If the circuit under test contains many more OR gates than AND gates, what can be done to increase the random pattern fault coverage? (d) Figure 1(b) shows a scannable flip-flop in Fig. 1(a) with reset (i.e., when R = 1, the flip-flop will be reset to logic 0). SE in Figure 1(b) represents the scan enable signal.  When the reset circuit is tested (for single stuck-at faults), what problem may occur?

The goal of this exercise is to increase the flexibility (extensibility) of the pectoralis major muscle.  You teach the patient to stand facing a corner with the shoulders abducted to 90deg, elbows flexed to 90deg, and hands and forearms placed on the walls. You tell the patient to relax into the stretch (by leaning into the corner) for 30 seconds; push his forearms into the walls for a count of six; then relax and lean forward toward the corner again and hold for 30 seconds. The self-stretching technique the patient is using is:

1. (20 points) Multiple-choice questions:     (1) Two types of errors associated with hypothesis testing are Type I and Type II. Type II error is committed when (3 points)          (A) We reject the null hypothesis whilst the alternative hypothesis is true         (B) We reject a null hypothesis when it is true         (C) We accept a null hypothesis when it is not true     (2) A hypothesis test is done in which the alternative hypothesis is that more than 10% of a population is left-handed. The p-value for the test is calculated to be 0.25 and the significance level is 0.01. Which statement is correct? (3 points)         (A) We can conclude that more than 10% of the population is left-handed.         (B) We can conclude that more than 25% of the population is left-handed.         (C) We can conclude that exactly 25% of the population is left-handed.         (D) We cannot conclude that more than 10% of the population is left-handed.     (3) Suppose we wish to test H0: m <= 53 vs H1: m > 53, what will result if we conclude that the mean is greater than 53 when its true value is really 55? (3 points)         (A) We have made a Type I error         (B) We have made a correct decision         (C) We have made a Type II error         (D) None of above are correct     (4) Given H0: m=25, H1: m[?]25, and p-value = 0.041. Do you reject or fail to reject H0 at the 0.01 level of significance? (3 points)         (A) fail to reject H0         (B) not sufficient information to decide         (C) reject H0     (5) Which of the following statements about hypothesis testing is true? (4 points)         (A) If the p-value is greater than the significance level, we fail to reject H0         (B) A type II error is rejecting the null when it is actually true         (C) If the alternative hypothesis is that the population mean is greater than a specified value, then the test is a two-tailed test         (D) The significance level equals one minus the probability of a Type I error         (E) None of the above statements are true     (6) Suppose H0: p=0.4, and the power of the test for the alternative hypothesis p=0.35 is 0.75. Which of the following is a valid conclusion? (4 points)         (A) The probability of committing a Type I error is 0.05         (B) The probability of committing a Type II error is 0.65         (C) If the alternative p=0.35 is true, the probability of failing to reject H0 is 0.25         (D) If the null hypothesis is true, the probability of rejecting it is 0.25         (E) If the null hypothesis is false, the probability of failing to reject it is 0.65   2. (30 points) The table below shows the time intervals, in seconds, between successive white cars in free flowing traffic on an open road.     Time 0-20 20-60 60-180   Frequency 41 35 24    Can these times be modified by an exponential distribution? The pdf of an exponential distribution is given by:   Sample mean x = (10*41+40*35+120*24)/100=46.9, which can be used as an estimate of l-1. (l = 1/46.9) Degree of freedom is 3-1-1=1. Significance level a = 0.05. (a) State the null and alternative hypothesis. (b) Perform the test and explain your conclusion. (c) Calculate approximate p value. 3. (25 points) Let X equal the weight in pounds of a 'one-pound' bag of carrots. Let m equal the median weight of a population of these bags. Test the null hypothesis H0: m=1.14 against the alternative hypothesis H1: m>1.14. Given the observed weights:  1.12          1.13          1.19          1.25          1.06          1.31          1.12           1.23          1.29          1.17          1.20          1.11          1.18          1.23 Use the Wilcoxon signed rank statistic to test the hypothesis. What is your conclusion?        4. (25 points) Let p be the fraction of engineers who do not understand certain basic statistical concepts. Unfortunately, in the past, the number has been high, about p=0.73.  A new program to improve the knowledge of statistical methods has been implemented, and it is expected that under this program p would decrease from the aforesaid 0.73 value. To test H0: p=0.73 against H1: p

Upon the recommendation of her child's pediatrician, a mother purchased a vaporizer for her child, who had been suffering from respiratory congestion. The vaporizer consisted of a gallon-size glass jar, which held water to be heated until it became steam, and a metal heating unit into which the jar fit. The jar was covered by a plastic cap with an opening to allow the steam to escape. At the time the vaporizer was manufactured and sold, there was no safer alternative design. The booklet that accompanied the vaporizer read: "This product is safe, spillproof, and practically foolproof. It shuts off automatically when the water is gone." The booklet had a picture of a vaporizer sending steam over a baby's crib. The mother used the vaporizer whenever the child was suffering from congestion. She placed the vaporizer on the floor near the child's bed. One night, the child got out of bed to get a drink of water and tripped over the cord of the vaporizer as she crossed the room. The top of the vaporizer separated from the base, and boiling water from the jar spilled on the child when the vaporizer tipped over. The child suffered serious burns as a consequence. The child's representative brought an action for damages against the manufacturer of the vaporizer. The manufacturer moved to dismiss after the representative presented the evidence above. Should the manufacturer's motion be granted?

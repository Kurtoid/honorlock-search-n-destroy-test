Short Answer 4 Nigel is a researcher interested in behavioral enrichment for zoo animals, and wants to investigate the effects of two types of foraging enrichment on chimpanzee behavior.  He plans to compare foraging puzzles, in which the chimps have to extract food out of a central apparatus, to scatter foraging, in which keepers hide and scatter small food bits across the entire enclosure.  Nigel plans to measure the amount of time chimps spend foraging and feeding in each enrichment condition.  One of his lab assistants, Zak, suggests that he run his experiment using an independent-samples design, so that a different set of chimps are used for each enrichment condition.  Nigel's other lab assistant, Bronson, suggests a related-samples design, in which the same set of chimps receives both conditions. a. If all other factors are equal, which design (Zak's or Bronson's) should have greater statistical power? Briefly explain why.  (4 pts.) b. If all other factors are equal, which design should have a greater risk of a Type II error? Briefly explain why.  (3 pts.)

As the teacher, you wonder if the current class of students spends more time analyzing research articles than prior classes.  Therefore, she had her students record the time spend analyzing their final research project in minutes.  You sampled ten students in the current years to compare to ten random students from the prior year's class.  The data is as follows:  correct answers are worth 15 points total)     Research time from class of 2018 in minutes   Research time from class of 2019 in minutes     120 minutes   110     100   110     90   80     110   120     50   60     90   80     80   120     110   40     60   70     50   90     Data was entered into an Excel file an a t-test was performed using a 2 tailed test.  The significance value (p vale) was calculated to be 0.156306.  Interpret this value. 1.  Are the groups significantly different or not (7.5 points)?   2.  Write an appropriate conclusion for this study (7.5 points)?

El terreno comercial tiene vida ilimitada.
Sara Ellison occasionally makes investments in commercial real estate properties.  Sara is currently looking at a property.  Her plan is to lease the property to a series of long-term tenants.  Based on current conditions, Sara forecasts that the property will have a value of $7,700,000 in one year (t = 1), and she estimates that a 10% discount rate is appropriate.  It follows that the property's value today (t = 0) is $7,000,000. The county commission is in the process of reviewing the zoning for the area surrounding the property.  The decisions they make will have a profound effect on the amount that Sara can expect to receive from leasing the property.  So, while the property's expected value one year from now is expected to be $7,700,000, the actual value one year from now will depend critically on the decisions the commission makes over the next year.  Based on her reading of the commission and her knowledge of local real estate markets, Sara forecasts that after the commission acts this year, there is a 50% chance the property will be worth $9,200,000 at t = 1, and a 50% chance it will be worth $6,200,000 at t = 1. Given this scenario, Sara is also thinking about purchasing an option today to buy the property one year from now (at t = 1).  The exercise price on the option is $7,000,000.  When Sara calculated the value of the option today using the decision tree analysis (DTA) she estimated that the value of the option was $1,000,000.  She is also interested in valuing the option using the real option valuation (ROV) approach. Using real option valuation (ROV), what is the value of the option today (t = 0)?  Assume that the risk-free rate is 4.5%.

The power rating of a resistor is the maximum power the resistor can safely dissipate without too great a rise in temperature and hence damage to the resistor. If the power rating of a 17 kilo-ohm resistor is 10 W, what is the maximum allowable potential difference across the resistor terminals?

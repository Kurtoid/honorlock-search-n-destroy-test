A 58 yo man is referred to the Pulmonary Clinic for shortness of breath. He was a construction worker in NYC for a number of years, and spent eight years working at the World Trade Center site, post 9/11. He recently retired and moved to Gainesville to be closer to his daughter. He is a social drinker and takes a diuretic (Lasix) for blood pressure control. BMI = 27. BP = 135/95 mm Hg. Heart rate = 85 bpm. Respiratory rate = 20 bpm. PFT generated the following values; FEV = 3.4 L and the FEV1 = 3.1 L. He is given Albuterol and the PFT is repeated; the same results are obtained. Given this information you would predict that his lung compliance is closest to which value (L/cm H2O)?
Which of the following sentences is most closely related to how a word2vec skip-gram model is trained?
A transformer that is [L] cm long, [W] cm wide, and [H] cm high is to be cooled by attaching a [L]-cm x [W]-cm-wide polished aluminum heat sink (emissivity = [e]) to its top surface. The heat sink has [n] fins, which are [hf] cm high, [t] cm thick, and [L] cm long. A fan blows air at [Tinf]degC parallel to the passages between the fins. The heat sink is to dissipate [Qdot] W of heat and the base temperature of the heat sink is not to exceed [Ts]degC. Assuming the fins and the base plate to be nearly isothermal and the radiation heat transfer to be negligible, determine  thee heat transfer coefficient the minimum freestream velocity the fan needs to supply to avoid overheating. (use the box below to answer this part)  Assume the flow is laminar over the entire finned surface of the transformer.    Show all your work on the work upload (assumptions, schematics, analysis, etc.) document. Write down units in your equations. Solve symbolically and plug in numbers at the end.
Imagine that you are gearing up to teach a unit about telling time in first grade that will have students focus on telling and writing time in hours and half-hours using both analog and digital clocks.  Using what you learned about differentiation during your Assessment Enrichment Day, what are TWO specific ways you could differentiate your lessons for your students?  NOTE:  Make sure to give TWO clear and specific differentiation examples.

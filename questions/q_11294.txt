Q8. Water enters a 3-cm-diameter and 30-m-long tube who walls are maintained at 100 oC with a bulk temperature of 25 oC and volume flow rate of 3 m3/h. Assuming Nusselt number can be determined from Nu = 0.023Re0.8Pr0.4, determine the  convective heat transfer coefficient.  Is the flow fully developed when it leaves (exit out of) the pipe? Is the flow laminar or turbulent? Properties of water can be found from the data sheet attached.

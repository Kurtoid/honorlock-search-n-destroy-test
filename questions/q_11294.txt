Today, it is possible for a diabetic patient to purchase human insulin from a pharmacist.  The technology that makes this possible is recombinant DNA technology.  This is a benefit over how things used to be because the human insulin comes from the gene that produces insulin in humans, which has been spliced into a bacterial genome. The bacterium produces the insulin, which is then purified for human use. Before there was genetically engineered human insulin using bacterium, diabetics were given a much more superior insulin product extracted from pig pancreases, which was similar to, but not exactly like, human insulin. Because it was not exactly like human insulin, the pig insulin never caused complications in diabetic patients.

Question 27.  Lawyer Fred represents Client Esther in a motor vehicle accident in which she was rear-ended by Driver Don.  Don's liability for the accident is clear, and Client Esther is suffering from severe back pain and is facing expensive surgery.  Esther tells Lawyer Fred that she has never been in an accident before and that this accident was the sole cause of her injuries.

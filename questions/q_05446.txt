We are still working with gasoline consumption data.    We would like to compare the following models: Model 1: MPG=  B0 + B1 Disp  (SSE = 272.91 ). Model 2: MPG = B0 + B1 Disp + B2 Horsepower + B3Torque  (SSE = 263.00). The SAS output below is from the partial F-test.   Use alpha = 0.05 and 2 decimal places for your final answer. The MS Numerator [a] and MS Denominator [b] are, respectively. From the results, we conclude that the  F-value is [c]  than the critical value, therefore we [d] H0.

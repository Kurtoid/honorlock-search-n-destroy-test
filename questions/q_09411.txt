Choose one of the topics below on which to write your final exam essay. Since you will be typing in Canvas, you will not be able to set up your answer in MLA format, so instead, type your name at the top, hit enter, type a title for your essay, hit enter, and begin your essay. Include a space between paragraphs rather than trying to indent the first line of each paragraph. Quotes and citations, however, do need to be in correct MLA format.  Analyze the changing poetic voice as revealed through Dickinson's "I Could Not Stop for Death," Frost's "Out, Out -," and Eliot's "The Waste Land." Focus on the speakers and their discussions of death. Come to a conclusion on what their different voices divulge about the ever-altering poetic outlook on life and death. Use specific examples of the poems throughout the essay that support your ideas. Remember, do not only discuss the subject matter of the poems. Look at what that subject matter reveals about the different voices of these poets.     Analyze how the issue of racism is addressed by DuBois and Washington; Hughes in one of his poems; and Baldwin in "Going to Meet the Man." Alternately, you may use one of Sterling Brown's poems in place of a poem by Hughes. Note the similarities between the works and where perspective may have changed. Make sure to quote from each work and to include any historical and/or cultural events that affected the writers and/or increased or decreased aspects of racism in America.

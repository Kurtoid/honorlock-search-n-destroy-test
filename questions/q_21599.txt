Camp Winnataska has 21 camp counselors to assign to grades 4, 5, 6, and 7.  Jefferson's  method will be used to assign the counselors to the grades.  The assignment of counselors  is based on  the number of campers.  Use a modified divisor of 12.4 with the following table to make the assignments.               Grade   4   5   6   7     Number of campers   58   86   64   82              How many counselors will be assigned to grade 6?

You will use this problem for Questions 5 and 6.  Read carefully!  Free body diagrams will be graded in the written work. An apple crate has a weight of 225 N, and is moved across the floor by the 2 forces directed as shown in the diagram. (a)  Draw a free body diagram on your paper.  Use that diagram to find the normal force on the crate. (b)  If mk = 0.12, find the horizontal acceleration of the crate across the floor. For this question, enter the answer to part (b) - the acceleration of the crate.

If a person unlawfully gains access to a computer and fraudulently causes goods to be "lost" from their true destination, he might be guilty of _______.
Below are postulated protonation states of lysine. pKa values for lysine are 2.2 (a-COOH), 9.0 (a-NH3+), 10.5 (R group).  Blank #1: List the letters of the 4 states that do NOT form at any pH, separated by commas. (1 pt each, 4 pts) Blank #2: List the letter of the zwitterion. (1 pt) Blanks #3 -> #6:  For each of the 4 states that do form (the four you did not list in Blank #1) list the following: the letter of that state, and the approximate pH range in which that state predominates (>90%). IF THERE IS NO pH RANGE WHERE A STATE PREDOMINATES, LIST THE LETTER OF THAT STATE AND SAY "no range". Make sure to only do one state per blank. Separate the letter and pH with a comma (for example: B, 3.3 to 5.3).  (0.5 pts each, 2 pts) Blank #7: Calculate the isoelectric point of lysine. (1 pt) Blank #8: What is percent of the acid (HA) and conjugate base (A-) at pH of 2.0? Write the answer as HA (__%), A- (__%). Round each answer to 1 decimal place. (2 pts)

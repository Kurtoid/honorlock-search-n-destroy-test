'Top of the Muffin' is a food preparation company that produces a variety of food related items in accordance with special job orders from cafeterias.   As a result, 'Top of the Muffin' uses job costing as its cost accounting system with inspection occuring at the end of the production process.  The UW-Madison dorms places an order/job (Job #33) for 2,100 boxes of assorted muffins.  'Top of the Muffin' has a total of $9 of cost per box broken down as follows (DM = $4, DL = $3, MOH = $2).  The MOH amount of $2 includes a provision for normal spoilage and rework. 'Top of the Muffin' quality control specialists reject 400 boxes, a normal rejection rate, because the boxes don't meet the particular specifications of UW-Madison (thus the spoilage is attributable to a specific job).   These normally spoiled boxes can not be sold to UW-Madison and instead are sold immediately to other customers for $2 per box.    In addition, an employee at 'Top of the Muffin' dropped 100 boxes (an abnormal event), spoiling them.   These boxes can not be sold to UW-Madison and are instead sold immediately to other customers for $1 per box. In regards to Job #33, what is the cost per unit/box of the remaining 1,600 good boxes?

Sound waves enter the ear and cause the _________A_________ (use anatomical name) to vibrate. This vibration is then transmitted through the middle ear and the three auditory ossicles. The ossicles are named (in order of vibration - from lateral to medial) malleus, _________B________, and stapes; with the stapes located within the __________C__________ window. This causes waves to form within the fluid of the inner ear.  This fluid is called the _________D___________ and located within the scala vestibuli, causing displacement of the basilar membrane. This displacement is detected by hair cells which are a form of _________E___________(type of receptor), which generates the action potential. The action potential then travels along the ________F____________ nerve back to the thalamus and finally reaching the ________G____________ lobe of the cerebrum.

QUESTION 4     A gymnast with a mass of 50kg jumps on a trampoline. When she makes contact with the trampoline, her velocity is 4m.s-1 downward. She is in contact with the trampoline for 0.2 seconds before moving up again. The graph below shows the average force that the trampoline exerts on the girl when she is in contact with the trampoline. Right click on the following blue button to open the images for QUESTION 4, in a new tab.         4.1   Calculate the area below the graph.   (3)     4.2   Give the unit for your answer to Question 4.1.   (1)     4.3   Name the physical quantity represented by the area under the graph.   (1)     4.4   Calculate the girl's change in momentum.   (2)     4.5   Calculate the speed at which the girl leaves the trampoline.   (4)     4.6   Compare the force that the trampoline exerts on the girl with the force that the girl exerts on the trampoline.   (1)     4.7   Name and state the law used to answer Question 4.6.   (2)         Pieter is standing on a trolley moving to the right at a constant speed of 2m.s-1. The combined mass of Pieter and the trolley is 140kg. He also holds a bag of potatoes with a mass (extra) of 5kg. Pieter throws the bag of potatoes horizontally to reduce the speed of the trolley. Ignore friction.         4.8   In what direction should he throw the bag of potatoes to slow down the trolley? Write only to the right or to the left.   (2)     4.9   Calculate the magnitude of the velocity at which the bag of potatoes should be thrown so that the trolley will slow down to a velocity of 1.5 m.s-1, but still move in the original direction.   (5)             [21]

Below are data for shoe sales at three different locations.  Conduct an analysis of variance using the data. In this setting you are testing the hypothesis that the average sales is equal for the different stores.         Thunderbird McDowell Cactus   50 52 91   60 62 97   55 63 64   72 78 86   92 86 81    With those data conduct ANOVA and select the correct responses. (a) The sum of squares total is [a]. (b) The MSTR (aka MSB) is [b]. (c) The overall variance of the test scores is [c]. (d) The p-value is [d]. (e) At the 0.10 level of significance you [e] conclude that average sales are different.  For alpha = 0.10: (f) The LSD is [f].  (g) Using the LSD approach you [g] conclude that there is a difference between the averages for Thunderbird and Cactus.

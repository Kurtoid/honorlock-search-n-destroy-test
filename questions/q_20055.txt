Here that excerpt from the Sheshunoff opinion again:   We agree with Light's recitation of basic contract law in footnote six that "[i]f only one promise is illusory, a unilateral contract can still be formed; the non-illusory promise can serve as an offer, which the promisor who made the illusory promise can accept by performance." Upon further review of the Act and its history, however, we disagree with footnote six insofar as it precludes a unilateral contract made enforceable by performance from ever complying with the Act because it was not enforceable at the time it was made.   At the outset, this language in Light was not essential to the holding in that case. Light held that the agreement in issue was not a unilateral contract but was an enforceable bilateral contract when made because, as the court construed the employer's promise to provide training in that case, the employer had made a promise to provide initial training that was enforceable when made. "Even if Light had resigned or been fired after this agreement was executed, United would still have been required to provide the initial training." Light, 883 S.W.2d at 646. As explained above, the fatal defect in the agreement in Light was not that it was unenforceable when made, but that there was no "ancillary" promise by the employee, such as a promise not to disclose confidential information, that the covenant not to compete was designed to enforce.   Based upon this excerpt alone, what is this Court's approach to Light? (There is one correct answer.)

Case Excerpt for Question 21 It is a longstanding rule of our state's common law that those who undertake abnormally dangerous activities are subject to strict liability for the harm they cause to the person, land, and chattels of others. We hereby adopt Sections 519 and 520 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts and utilize those provisions to aid in determining whether the drilling and operation of natural gas wells is an abnormally dangerous activity under the circumstances of this case. The Restatement (Second) of Torts provides that in determining whether an activity is abnormally dangerous, the extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage is to be considered.   The lower court held Ravelli strictly liable for its drilling and natural gas wells in the McCormick Gas Field. Ravelli notes that the drilling and operation of natural gas wells in the McCormick Gas Field is a "matter of common usage" and is an appropriate activity for the place in which it is carried on -- i.e., it does not constitute a "non-natural use" of the land. The McCormick Gas Field is the largest known reservoir of natural gas in the country. Thus, the drilling and operation of natural gas wells in this area is a common, accepted, and natural use of the land.    In context, the underlined sentence most likely refers to which of the following?

Skill C2.  A design team must select a lead-free solder for a new printed circuit board that it is designing for a large customer order.  The team is considering three alternatives: SAC305, SAC105, M35.  If the solder is SAC305, the total cost of manufacturing the boards will be $1 million.  If the solder is SAC105, the total cost of manufacturing the boards depends upon the choice of solder supplier; if they choose supplier A, the total cost will be $1.05 million; if they choose supplier B, the total cost will be $980,000.  If the solder is M35, the total cost of manufacturing the boards depends upon the solder reliability.  If they choose M35, they will perform testing to determine its reliability; testing will cost $25,000.  If the reliability is adequate, then the total cost of manufacturing the boards will be $950,000.  If the reliability is inadequate, then they will have to choose SAC305 or SAC105 (and a supplier for SAC105).  Rose, their manufacturing engineer, estimates that the probability that the reliability will be adequate is 0.75. Which one of the following decision trees corresponds to the solder selection decision? A.   B.   C.   D.

The Laramie Internet Company is considering expanding into a new area, but isn't sure whether it will be cost-effective. The cost of providing internet service to a resident is proportional to the distance to the nearest power line, costing 60 dollars per mile. Given a square two-by-two mile town with power lines along its south and west borders, what is the average service cost over this area?

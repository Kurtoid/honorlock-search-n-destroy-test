Parts arrive according to a Poisson process with a mean rate of 10 per hour between 6AM and noon each day.  As parts arrive, they are placed (instantaneously) in a temporary warehouse.  Each hour, at the top of the hour, starting at 7AM each day, all parts from the temporary warehouse are removed and sent to Department 501 for processing.  Department 501 consists of two workstations:  WS A and WS B.  Parts are first processed in WS A, then processed in WS B, then leave the department.  There is no time lapse in movement from the temporary warehouse to WS A.  Travel time from WS A to WS B is 5 minutes.  Travel time from WS B to leaving the department is 5 minutes. WS A consists of two single-server machines operating in parallel with one queue feeding both machines.  (In other words, each part is processed through one and only one machine within WS A.)  One of the two machines processes parts according to an exponential distribution with mean 15 minutes and the other machine processes parts according to an exponential distribution with a mean of 7.5 minutes.  WS B consists of a single-server machine.  The processing time on the machine is exponentially distributed with mean 6 minutes.    Each completed part yields a profit of $50 and each hour that a part spends in Department 501 cost 75 cents.  (There is no cost associated with time spent in the temporary warehouse.)  Department 501 closes as soon as all parts that will arrive for the day have exited the department.  Simulate this system to answer the following two questions:  (1) What is the average daily profit of the system? And (2) What the average time that Department 501 can close?  Put the answers to these two questions in a Floor Label.  The answer to (1) should be rounded to the nearest dollar and the answer to (2) should be rounded to the nearest minutes.  For (2) give your answer in the form hh:mm AM or hh:mm PM (i.e., use a 12-hour clock). Base your answers on 50 days of data with one replication being a single day.

House finches (birds) occurred only in western North America until 1939, when a few individuals were released in New York City. These individuals established a breeding population and gradually expanded their range. The western population also expanded its range somewhat eastward, and the two populations have recently come in contact. Which of the following terms best describes the process that had occurred if the two forms did not interbreed when their expanding ranges met?

Consider the single MDP. At each state, you can take one of two actions. Just for ease of reading we have drawn the single MDP as two graphs, one with the transition probabilities for action 1 and the other with the transition probabilities for action 2. The transition probabilities are on the transition arcs between states and the reward for entering each state is written above or below the state as r=#. What are the utilities of each of the states, assuming g =0.9?

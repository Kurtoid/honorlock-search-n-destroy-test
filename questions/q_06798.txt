You are a clinician at a hospital-based clinic in a small rural town. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted your community as it is mostly racial/ethnic minority and significantly older than the average community age, with most residents falling below the national poverty threshold. Given these dynamics, your community was elated when it was announced that the local hospital would have access to the COVID-19 vaccine in a few weeks. However, in the initial roll out plans from the local public health authorities, psychologists were left off the list of healthcare workers that would be vaccinated in the first wave. You and your colleagues were upset as you enter the hospital everyday for clinic and work with high-risk populations in person (telehealth options have been limited in your community). Many of your colleagues have contracted COVID from the work setting over the past months. In response, you organize a strong advocacy campaign to your local government to get mental health providers added to the first wave of vaccine distributions. SUCCESS!!! Not only does the local government add psychologists to the first wave, but every professional working in the hospital context is also added. The hospital administration is excited by this news and calls you into a meeting to thank you for your advocacy effort. During that meeting, you find out that the roll out plan has been updated and will begin the following Monday. Specifically, the local government has decided to prioritize hospital employees AND their families (reasoning that the virus will be better contained if families are vaccinated together). Additionally, the hospital will be mandated that employees are vaccinated within the next 6 weeks or they will not be allowed back to work (this would represent a significant economic issue for you as you are paid by the session). You inquire about the number of vaccines this will take to accomplish and learn that due to this prioritization, vaccines will not be available to the second wave (community members over 75) for almost 3 months. You are uncomfortable with this, but you are told that the decisions are final, and vaccinations begin Monday.   a. Use an ethical decision-making model, the APA ethics code (principle and standards), and relevant literature to outline your response to this dilemma. You should look ahead to the four solution options provided in point b as you will have to specify one as your final course of action.   b. You must choose one of the following actions:    You and your family take the vaccine appointment. You take a vaccine appointment but disregard the government mandate to have your family vaccinated and do not bring them to the appointment. You decline the vaccine appointment on behalf of you and your family and determine how to survive with 50% of your family income gone. Other (Specify your own solution to this case). Note *If you select this option, you must specify a solution that satisfies the case without conditions. That is to say, you can not state that if xyz were true, then I could do this. This solution must work within the details given in the case (as the three options above do)    c. Please indicate any actions you take following your decision above.   d. Reflect on this scenario and briefly (1-2 paragraphs) discuss the intersection between ethical and equitable responsibilities for psychologists.

Vasopressin is a hormone that is primarily released when the body is low on water. Release of vasopressin causes the kidneys to conserve water by concentrating urine and decreasing urine output. However, vasopressin also has additional functions in other tissues such as the brain and blood vessels, which are not directly involved in urine production. How could it be possible for vasopressin to trigger different responses in different tissues?
At what age does the caloric requirement usually begin to decrease and why?
Which drug category contains the drugs that are the first line of therapy for COPD?
On blank paper (or graph paper, if you have some already out), draw a Free Body Diagram (FBD) for each object described below. Label each force. Pay attention to the lengths of your vectors. They do not need to be exactly to length (you don't have enough information!), but the relative sizes are important. 2a) A ball, just after release, on the way up. Ignore air resistance.  2b) Skier, holding onto a rope, being lowered down the hill. Consider friction.  2c) Box B, moving to the left at decreasing speed.  Note: Box A is in contact with Box B, but the two boxes are not attached.  Consider friction.  2d) (8 pts) A woman is moving downward in an elevator at increasing speed.  Draw 3 FBDs- one for the elevator, one for the woman, and one for the elevator/woman system.   In the box below, describe any 3rd Law pairs that you see among the forces shown in your 3 FBDs for 2d.  For example: The ______ force on the FBD of the __________ is a 3rd law pair to the ________force on the FBD of the ______________.
In photosynthesis, redox reactions ultimately transfer electrons from ______ to ______.
In fetal circulation, the ________ connects the pulmonary trunk with the aorta.

Explain the events of excitation-contraction coupling. This is the mechanism where an action potential causes muscle fiber contraction. Ideally, start with stimulation of the muscle cell by a neurotransmitter and end with beginning of cross-bridge formation. Not necessary to describe the mechanism of an action potential or how action potentials travel across a cell. Possible terminology: Sarcoplasmic reticulum, T-tubule, action potential, Calcium (Ca2+), ligand-gated channel, voltage-gated channel, depolarization, repolarization, hyperpolarization, resting potential, acetylcholine (ACh), graded potential, excitatory/inhibitory post-synaptic potential, sarcolemma, Sodium (Na+), troponin, tropomyosin, actin, myosin. Please make sure to demonstrate understanding of any terminology used. Proper usage of more basic terminology to demonstrate concept is highly encouraged over improper usage of more technical terminology. SIMPLE SENTENCES ARE YOUR FRIEND, but not mandatory. This is not an English paper.

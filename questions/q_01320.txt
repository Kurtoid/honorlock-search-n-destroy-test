Calculate DH for the reaction: C2H2 (g) - 2 C (s) + H2 (g)   (overall) given the following chemical equations and their respective enthalpy changes.               C2H2(g)  +  5/2 O2(g)  -  2 CO2(g)  +  H2O(l)                         DH = -1299.6 kJ                              C(s)  +  O2(g)    -  CO2(g)                                       DH = -393.5 kJ                              H2(g)  +  1/2 O2(g)  -  H2O(l)                                   DH = -285.8 kJ
This is the same fact pattern as that above - Question 1 part b Mathis Family Dentistry Corporation is owned as follows: Josh - 200 shares Josh's son, Jack - 200 shares Dale - 300 shares Wind River Family Dentistry Corporation - 300 shares Jack owns 40% of Wind River Family Dentistry Corporation. Dale is unrelated. Mathis Family Dentistry redeems all of Josh's shares for $55 per share on 12/31. Josh's AB in his Mathis Family Dentistry stock was $6,000 ($30 per share) prior to the stock redemption. Assume Mathis Family Dentistry has total E&P of $150,000.   B. Are there any other options available to Josh if he fails to qualify for sale/exchange treatment under the bright line tests? Justify your answer.
The lethal dose required to kill 50% of the population in 30 days is expressed as LD 50/30. As humans often survive beyond the 30-day period, the LD 50/60, or lethal dose required to kill 50% of the population in 60-days is more useful.  The LD 50/60 for humans is approximately how many rads?

22. Embryonic stem cell research is a medical practice that works as follows. A human ovum (or "egg") undergoes in-vitro fertilization in artificial laboratory conditions instead of inside the womb. Then, after in-vitro fertilization is carried out, a human embryo or human blastocyst is grown in a container and specific types of cells called "stem" cells are removed from that embryo or blastocyst. As a result, the embryo or blastocyst ceases to function biologically, and thus it dies. The removed stem cells are then used for researching a variety of areas of basic human biology, and they are used for a wide variety of medical treatments that save people's lives and benefit people with many types of serious medical conditions. Thus, many people expect that as stem cell research becomes more and more advanced in the next few decades, stem cell research will be developed into one of the most resourceful and beneficial areas of medical science there has ever been. However, there are moral questions that surround stem cell research because stem cell research requires the destruction of human embryos and human blastocysts. With all of this in mind, which of the following is true?    A. Bonnie Steinbock's interest view supports the idea that stem cell research is morally permissible. B. The life argument supports the idea that stem cell research is morally permissible. C. The argument from potential supports the idea that stem cell research is morally permissible. D. If Max believes that human genetics are what it is that gives the human being full moral status, then Max would believe that stem cell research is morally permissible.

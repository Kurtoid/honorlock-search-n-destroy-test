Consider a multi-core processor with heterogeneous cores: A, B, C and D where core B runs twice as fast as A, core C runs three times as fast as A and cores D and A run at the same speed (ie have the same processor frequency, micro architecture etc). Suppose an application needs to compute the square of each element in an array of 256 elements. Consider the following two divisions of labor:   Case 1: Core A: 32 elements Core B: 128 elements Core C: 64 elements Core D: 32 elements   Case 2: Core A: 48 elements Core B: 128 elements Core C: 80 elements Core D: Unused   Ignore cache effects by assuming that a perfect prefetcher is in operation.   (a)  Compute the total execution time taken in the two cases (b) Compute the cumulative processor utilization (amount of total time the processors are not idle divided by the total execution time). (c) For case (2), if you do not consider Core D in cumulative processor utilization (assuming we have another application to run on Core D), how would utilization change?

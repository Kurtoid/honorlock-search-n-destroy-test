In one study, 8 student subjects took a test of sensitivity to contrast after a fixed time facing into bright sun, both with and without eye grease. Measurements for the increase in sensitivity to contrast were obtained for the 8 subjects.  A positive value indicates they were more sensitive to contrast when using black eye grease (the desired outcome) and a negative value indicates they were less sensitive.

In a species of salamander, there are two forms, red and yellow. As the yellow form becomes less common due to predation and the red form more common, the yellow form becomes less likely to be eaten and more likely to survive and reproduce. The yellow form then becomes more common and roles of red and yellow forms reverse. What type of selection is responsible?

Three kinds of tickets are available for a concert: "up close", "in the middle", and "nosebleed". "Up close" tickets cost $25 more than "in the middle" tickets. "In the middle" tickets cost $35 more than "nosebleed" tickets. Twice the cost of an "up close" ticket is $60 more than 6 times the cost of a "nosebleed" ticket. (a) Write a system of equations that models this application, where x is the price of "up close" tickets, y is the price of "in the middle" tickets, and z is the price of "nosebleed" tickets. (b) Find the price of each kind of ticket by solving the system of equations produced in step a. You will only receive credit if you use solving systems techniques on the equations set up in a, and show your work. NO CREDIT WILL BE PROVIDED FOR ANSWERS OBTAINED THROUGH OTHER MEANS (such as 'guessing' at the prices).

Integrative 1 Dr. Brennan investigates the effect of distraction on risk for traffic accidents.  36 participants use a driving simulator to drive on a road that winds through small towns and open rural areas.  Participants are first asked to engage in the driving task without any distractions present.  Then they are asked to drive the route a second time, but now participants must engage in a text-messaging task at the same time.  Participants are given a recognition memory test after each condition: they are asked to identify objects that they would have seen during the driving task (for example, "was the traffic sign at the first intersection a stop sign or a yield sign?").  Dr. Brennan records the number of errors on the recognition test in each condition. Test whether the presence of a distracting task significantly changes the number of errors.  Use an alpha of .05 and the values shown below. **NOTE: You may not need to use all values shown.  Choose the values that are relevant to the test you conduct, and ignore the other values. M Distraction = 10.56                M No Distraction = 8.89             MD = (Dist - No Dist) = 1.67 SS Distraction = 84.22               SS No Distraction =112.89         s2D (for difference scores) = 10.75 a.  Name the specific inferential test that is appropriate for this study. b.  Conduct a hypothesis test.

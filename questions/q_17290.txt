Questions 24-29 are all based on the same passage: "Step into a Different Neighborhood". Read the paragraph carefully and the question that follows it. Then, use context clues to select the proper answer choice. One day, a wealthy father took his son, Calvin, on a trip to a neighborhood less fortunate than theirs. He wanted to expose Calvin to a different way of living. Mr. Jamison, the father, hoped this trip would make Calvin more grateful for his privileges. At 9'oclock Saturday morning, the father and son left Cambridge Meadows, their upscale community. In 45 minutes, they arrived in Brewster Village, a less ritzy area. Calvin felt uncomfortable. They parked their 2019 BMW M4 on Elmhurst Street, which happened to be the street where Mr. Jamison grew up. Then, they began to walk through the neighborhood. While looking around the area, Calvin immediately noticed many differences. The streets in Brewster were busier and noisier than those in Cambridge Meadows. Traffic was heavier. More people were walking. A few stray dogs and cats wandered about. Above everything, what stood out most to Calvin was how happy the people were to see his father. As he watched his father's old friends and acquaintances greet Mr. Jamison with warm words, Calvin began to feel comfortable, as though he were at home. Suddenly, Brewster Village started to feel like a quite fortunate place. What does the term "ritzy" mean as it is used in the paragraph?

Description  Evaluation of Screening Tests         The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of fasting blood glucose (FBS) as a screening test for impaired glucose tolerance. In this study, impaired glucose tolerance is determined by second hour glycemia after oral load (2hBS). Consecutive patients in a primary care clinic who had medical history and physical exam findings that prompted screening for metabolic abnormalities were enrolled in the study, excluding patients with known type 2 diabetes and those taking medications that affect glucose or insulin metabolism. A total of 379 patients were enrolled in the study. Patients were classified on FBS (high or normal) and 2hBS (impaired glucose tolerance, yes or no) using established criteria. Of the 36 patients with impaired glucose tolerance (yes), 14 had high fasting glucose levels. Of the 343 patients who did not have impaired glucose tolerance (no), 59 had high fasting glucose levels.            2hBS:Impaired Glucose Tolerance YES 2hBS:Impaired Glucose Tolerance NO TOTAL   High FBS  14   59   73    Normal FBS  22   284   306    TOTAL   36   343   379       What is the correct interpretation of the specificity of this test?

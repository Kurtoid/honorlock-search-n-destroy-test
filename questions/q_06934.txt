Some students have been told that people remember words that are written in green ink better than red ink. Therefore, I collected data from 3 sections of Psych 202. My 1:00 pm class had a list of words in blue ink to memorize. My 2:30 pm class had a list of words in green ink to memorize. My 4:00 pm class had a list of words in red ink to memorize. After a delay, student recalled as many words as they could. All classes had 20 students in each class. The SSBG = 111 and the SSWG = 650. Use the 7 steps of hypothesis testing to conduct an ANOVA that explores if ink color influences memory recall and use an a = .01. a. How many tails? What is the IV and DV? (3pts)b. State the null and alternative hypotheses using the appropriate symbols. (2 pts)c. Identify the critical value that will serve as the decision criterion. (1 pt)d. Compute the appropriate test statistic. Show your work and bold, underline, and italicize your final answer. (4 pts)e. State your decision regarding the null hypothesis. (1 pt)f. If appropriate, compute effect size (include formula!). Otherwise state N/A (2 pts)g. Interpret these results. (Remember: use "plain English" and present the relevant statistics and results in APA format.) (3 pts)

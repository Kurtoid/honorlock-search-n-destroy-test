Membrane osmometry (MO) is a useful technique for measuring molecular weight (MW) of polymers.  (i) Is it a relative or absolute method for the MW measurement?                      (2 pts) (ii) What specific molecular weight can OM measure?                                    (2 pts) (iii) A plot of p/(cRT) vs. concentration for a polymer sample in three different solvents (A, B, and C) is shown below. Which solvent is a poor, th, and good solvent for this hypothetical polymer? Moreover, calculate the molecular weight of this polymer.

Tony Stark doesn't have any real superpowers, but he does have an amazing exercise physiologist: you. Since he hasn't worked out in awhile, you are starting him with a light aerobic workout: walk at a level of energy expenditure (VO2) of 18 ml/kg/min. Solve for the percent grade he would need to walk at if he was walking at a speed of 67 m/min. Round your answer to one place after the decimal and do not include the percent sign when entering your answer. Equations:Age predicted maximum heart rate = 220 - age Intensity: Percent of age predicted heart rate maximum = (220 - age) x (% intensity / 100) Heart rate reserve = (HRmax/peak - HRrest) x (% intensity / 100) + HRrest VO2 Reserve = (VO2max/peak - VO2rest) x (% intensity / 100) + VO2rest Metabolic Equations: Walking: VO2 = 3.5 + (0.1 x speed) + (1.8 x speed x grade)  Jogging: VO2 = 3.5 + (0.2 x speed) + (0.9 x speed x grade)

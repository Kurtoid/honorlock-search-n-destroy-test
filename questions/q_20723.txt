In species such as the red-back spider, the black widow spider, the praying mantis, and the scorpion, the female commonly eats the male after mating. Another widespread form of cannibalism is size-structured cannibalism, in which large individuals consume smaller ones. Octopus, bats, toads, fish, monitor lizards, salamanders, crocodiles, spiders, crustaceans, birds, mammals, and a vast number of insects have all been observed to engage in size-structured cannibalism.  Yet another common form of cannibalism is infanticide.

An ideal parallel-plate capacitor consists of a set of two parallel plates of area  A  separated by a very small distance  d . When this capacitor is connected to a battery that maintains a constant potential difference between the plates, the energy stored in the capacitor is  U 0. If the separation between the plates is doubled, how much energy is stored in the capacitor?

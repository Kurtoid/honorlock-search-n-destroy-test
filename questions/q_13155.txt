At St. Edward's hospital, when patients afflicted with a certain disease are given the standard treatment, 20% show improvement in their symptoms. A new treatment for the disease has gained popularity at other hospitals, so the physicians at St. Edward's hospital decide to try the new treatment with 100 of their patients to test whether there is any difference in the new treatment's effectiveness. If 27 of the 100 patients given the new treatment show improvement, is this enough evidence to conclude with 95% certainty that the new treatment has a significantly different effect than the standard treatment?

Useful Equations:    ROA = R/A   ROE = Ie/E = (R - Id)/E   COD= Id/D   OPM = (NFIO + Id - LC ) / VFP   NFI = NFIO + CG   CR = CA / CL   WC = CA - CL   D-to-A ratio = D / A   E-to-A ratio = E / A   D-to-E ratio = D / E   CDRM = CDRC - URC   RM = CDRM - RA   ICR = R/Id    TDRC = CDRC / URC   RMCR = CDRC / (URC + RA)   ATR =VFP / A   OER = OE / VFP   DER = DE / VFP   IER = Id / VFP   NFIOR = NFIO / VFP   ROE = ((OPM x ATO) - Id/A)x A/E   CDRC = NFIO + DE + Iterm + NBI - PW

An amino acid can never exist as an uncharged compound, regardless of the pH of the solution. To be uncharged, an amino acid would have to lose a proton from an +NH3 group with a pKa of about 9 before it would lose a proton from a COOH group with a pKa of about 2. Therefore, at physiological pH (7.4), an amino acid exists as a dipolar ion, called a zwitterion. With another acidic or basic functional group, there may be more ions.      Choose the accurate zwitterion form of the amino acid above as it exists at physiological pH (7.4).

NOTE: Questions 12 through 17 are based on this article: Bumble's Bet on Women Won't Pay Off Everywhere  The owner of the No. 2 dating app has filed to go public with valuation talk in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion. Founder Whitney Wolfe Herd started it in 2014 to turn the traditional dating dynamic on its head. Instead of men initiating contact with women, who often say that attention is often aggressive or unwanted, Bumble was created as a platform on which women must make the first move. That was two years after Ms. Wolfe Herd co-founded dating app Tinder, which is now known mostly for its singles looking for hookups. She has said she saw the problems with archaic dating rules and sought to change them. For women looking for love, this has been a popular tack: Bumble says it believes its namesake app has one of the highest percentages of women paying users among dating apps. The question is whether it will prove to be a lucrative one for investors. A higher percentage of the Bumble app's users convert to payers than the market average among dating apps, according to OC&C Strategy Consultants--nearly 9% paid conversion among its 12.3 million monthly active users, the company said. But a women-centric approach also could pose some limitations to growth. Men are currently the significant majority of online dating users, according to the company. And while some men may enjoy sitting back and waiting to be approached, the preference doesn't appear to be unanimous: Bumble says it has about 30% more female users for every male user compared with the gender mix of users in the North America freemium dating market who don't use Bumble, citing OC&C. Historical gender norms might be more difficult to disrupt outside the U.S. Bumble has had high hopes for its Bumble app in India, for example, where it launched in late 2018, even enlisting Indian actress Priyanka Chopra as an adviser and investor. But it hasn't done much to dethrone Tinder there: Tinder was the highest-grossing app in the U.S. and world-wide last year, excluding gaming, and it was also No. 1 in India, according to App Annie Intelligence. In India, Bumble didn't break the top 10 in terms of consumer spending. Interestingly, Tinder tested a feature in India around the time of Bumble's launch there called "My Move," which allowed women to opt for a setting in which they would need to initiate conversation. Depending on its success, Tinder said it would consider launching the app more globally. Ominously for Bumble, Tinder owner Match Group hasn't indicated plans to roll out the feature anywhere else. World-wide, the difference between Bumble's and Tinder's respective growth rates is illuminating when one controls for the age of each app. Bumble app revenue grew almost 70% year over year in 2019 before the pandemic, according to the company's initial public offering filing. That is multiples higher than the revenue generated the same year by Badoo, the other dating app owned by Bumble which doesn't require women to make the first move. But it is only about half the rate at which Tinder grew its direct revenue on the same basis back in 2017, when it was the equivalent age.   Tinder's successful launch of "My Move" in India calls into question the ______________ of Bumble's core competency.

Capillary action is a result of water molecules: a) storing heat and thus moving faster because of heat of vaporization. b) having an adhesive and cohesive force, which allows them to attach to the vessel walls and themselves. c) being associated with hydrophobic molecules, which can result in upward movement. d) producing sufficient surface tension to overcome the pull of gravity.

WORKOUT PROBLEM 2  (30 points) (Nothing to submit here, just read the problem. Homework format/layout is NOT necessary but DETAILED SOLUTION must be uploaded.) Indiana Jones has an unfortunate encounter with a 1000-kg boulder with a 3-meter radius. The boulder is accidentally released from rest on a 10deg incline.  Indy, starting at the same location as the boulder, immediately starts running at 5 m/s down the incline.         Draw a FBD for the boulder.   If Indy has to run 35 meters to reach a side-passage in which he can duck and hide to avoid the boulder, can he make it?   Consider the following three alternate boulders.  For each case, determine if Indy would make out better or worse.  Be sure to properly justify your answer for each case.     A heavier boulder (larger mass).   A larger boulder (larger radius).   A boulder which was a hollow sphere of the same mass and radius.

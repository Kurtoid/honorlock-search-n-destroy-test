The Dodo was a turkey-sized flightless bird endemic to the island of Mauritius. The first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598, and the last sighting was in 1662.  The Dodo disappeared so quickly off the face of the earth that it has become the poster bird for extinction.  When they weren't busy hunting, clubbing, and roasting Dodo Birds, the Dutch and Portuguese settlers of Mauritius did manage to ship a few living specimens back to Europe and today there are a handful of specimens of head, foot, skull, and leg bones in museums.  Thus there exist enough preserved remains to recover fragments of Dodo DNA, and the Dodo shares enough of its genome with the modern Nicobar Pigeon to make surrogate parenting a possibility.  Assuming that Dodo DNA could be reconstructed, what would be the most immediate obstacle to resurrecting the Dodo?

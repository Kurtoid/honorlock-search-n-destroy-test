The sex of birds, some insects, and other organisms is determined by a ZW chromosomal arrangement in which the males have like sex chromosomes (ZZ) and females are ZW (similar to XY in humans). Assume that a recessive lethal allele on the Z chromosome causes death of an embryo in birds. What sex ratio would result in the offspring if a cross were made between a male heterozygous for the lethal allele and a normal female?

Proteins by far have the most diverse functions of all organic macromolecules in living organisms.  They are involved in nearly every aspect of living organisms from building a cell's cytoskeleton to transporting oxygen around the body.  Frederick Sanger was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1958 for being the 1st to decipher an amino acid sequence of a protein. This was insulin - the protein hormone that regulates sugar uptake into cells! Today deciphering amino acid sequences is relatively easy and can be accomplished using various methods such as a process called mass spectrometry.  The amino acid sequences of thousands of proteins are known today and this also includes their folded 3D conformations.  Human insulin contains 51 AMINO ACIDS and is shown below. Use this illustration to answer the next several questions.   50. The image below depicts the amino acids that make up insulin, which level of insulin's protein structure is depicted in this image? (Hint - Notice that there are 2 chains A and B and disulfide stabilizing bonds between cysteine Amino Acids).

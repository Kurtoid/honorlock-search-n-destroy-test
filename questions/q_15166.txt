The following questions refer to the diagram below. The solutions in the two arms of the U-tube are separated at the bottom of the tube by a selectively permeable membrane. At the beginning of the experiment the volumes in both arms are the same, and the level of the liquid is therefore at the same height. The membrane is permeable to water and to sodium and chloride ions, but not to glucose. The apparatus is allowed to stand for three days.      The concentration of sodium chloride on Side X will eventually equal that on Side Y because sodium and chloride ions will move by diffusion from one side to the other, gradually reaching a uniform density, and then the net movement of ions will stop.

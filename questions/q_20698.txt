The external force is removed, and the block is projected with a velocity v1 = 1.2 m/s upon separation from the spring. The block descends a ramp and has a velocity v2 = 1.9 m/s at the bottom. The track is frictionless between points A and B. The block enters a rough section at B, extending to E. The coefficient of kinetic friction over this section is 0.39. The velocity of the block is v3 = 1.4 m/s at C. The block moves on to D, where it stops.

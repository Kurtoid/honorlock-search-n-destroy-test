Below is the reciprocal lattice for a single cubic crystal.  Using your Stereographic Projection and Wulff net or math, determine the zone axis of the Reciprocal lattice? If the sample were gold which is FCC, use the structure factor to eliminate the planes that cannot diffract (just put an x through the planes that don't diffract) If the gold lattice constant a0 is 4.1A use a ruler to determine the scale factor for this image  If a Cu Ka (wavelength 1.54A) x-ray beam is incident on the crystal in the [-1 1 0] direction, sketch the Ewald sphere to scale indicate if any planes diffract and if so at what angle would you expect them to occur (you may have to extend the reciprocal lattice out)

Within a mesocycle, what's the best way to include variation from week to week?

The above is a good analogy for GMPs (general motor programs).  Whereas the record itself is the GMP (running, walking, jumping, balance), the speakers are the muscles (parameters) and limbs (effectors).  The music can also be modified in terms of amplitude (loud/soft) and frequency (fast/slow) or in a GMP it would indicate the parameters for the actual movement of the task. In the following task, describe two GMPs that may be used and discuss two parameters that might be modified throughout the project for each of the GMP you identified. TASK: A woodworker is building a piece of furniture that includes large, small, simple, and complex pieces.   For those of you who are not familiar with building furniture, equipment such as screwdrivers, table saws, circular saws,  power drills, chisels, hammers, and staple guns are commonly used.  These tools allow the woodworker to complete movements such as cutting, sawing, screwing, gluing. sanding, and staining. So, you will need to describe two GMP and two parameters for each.

Challenging Consider two firms, Firm A and Firm B, negotiating a "financial merger" (i.e., a merger to diversify the risk of their cash inflows). Each firm's assets, before the merger, have market values of $60 million and those asset values have standard deviations of 50 percent. If the firms merge, their values will not change (i.e., they will have a combined value of $120 million), but the standard deviation of their combined asset value will fall to 30 percent. Each firm also has zero-coupon debt that matures in one year and has a face value of $30 million. Assuming that the risk-free rate is 0 percent and using the Black-Scholes model, how much will the bondholders of the firms gain at the expense of the shareholders (i.e., the so-called coinsurance effect) if Firms A and B merge?

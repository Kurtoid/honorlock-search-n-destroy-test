Re-read the following article and answer the questions that follow. While everyone begins life without a notion of what is right and wrong, we all acquire a moral sense as we age. From this assumption, U.S. psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg (1927-1979) developed a theory that asserted that our development of a moral sense progresses through six recognizable stages, which can be subsumed under three levels. The first level is called the pre-conventional level and is assumed to be where all humans begin at birth. At this level, right is what results in pleasure, and wrong is whatever causes discomfort and unhappiness. Most people gradually develop to a second level in moral reasoning, called the conventional level. Kohlberg said that right and wrong at the conventional level of moral reasoning is primarily defined in terms of authority figures, be they parents, political leaders, or God. Kohlberg theorized that the highest level of moral reasoning is what he termed the post-conventional level. Those who reason about moral issues at this level do so primarily in terms of universal principles of equity and justice. In other words, neither pleasure/pain nor rules set forth by those in authority guide moral decision-making at the post-conventional level. Instead, an individual's own internalized sense of right and wrong emerges based on universal principles of the equal worth of human life. (Ellis and Walsh, Criminology, A Global Perspective, p. 314) Concerning the pre-conventional level of moral development, with which statement below would Kohlberg disagree?

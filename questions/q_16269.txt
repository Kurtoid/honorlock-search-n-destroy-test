Hypotheses with Two Samples of One Measurement VariableObesity is a major health problem today. Research is starting to show that people may be able to lose more weight on a low carbohydrate dietthan on a low fat diet. Research Question: Does the data suggest that, on the average, people are able to lose more weight on a low carbohydrate diet than on a lowfat diet?Response Variable: Weight loss (pounds)Explanatory (Grouping) Variable: Type of dietAlternate Hypothesis: There is no difference in the mean amount of weight loss when comparing a low carbohydrate diet with a low fat diet(population mean weight loss on a low carbohydrate diet = population mean weight loss on a low fat diet).Null Hypothesis: The mean weight loss should be greater for those on a low carbohydrate diet when compared with those on a low fat diet(population mean weight loss on a low carbohydrate diet > population mean weight loss on a low fat diet). This is a one-sided alternativehypothesis.

Two new vaccines for Covid-19 were made by a laboratory at Harvard, namely AnCOV-A and AnCOV-B. An experiment for testing the effectiveness of those two vaccines for COVID-19 was conducted. AnCOV-A was applied to a group of 10 people, while AnCOV-B was applied to a group of 30 people. The people were monitored regularly for 6 months and the results were sent back to CDC.

Consider an intersection of two roads (let's call them University Avenue and 13th Street) where each side is controlled by a traffic light controller. Please note that each state has only two variables where each variable can have only binary values. Consider the following events to determine transitions: signal stays green for 10 seconds and then changes to yellow, stays yellow for 10 seconds and then changes to red, stays red for 20 seconds and then becomes green, exception state (blinking red) is reached when malfunction happens in any state. If it reaches exception state, it stays there forever. Now consider a scenario that the traffic light on University Avenue became RED and the traffic light on 13th Street became GREEN exactly at the same time at 10:40 am on March 18, 2021. Can you prove that there would be no unsafe scenarios (such as both side green, or one side green and another side yellow at the same time) until 12:35 pm on April 18, 2021 for an FSM design based on the above specification? There are only two unsafe scenarios: i) both side green at exactly at the same time, or ii) one side green and another side yellow exactly at the same time (even one second overlap). If you believe unsafe scenario can happen, please show a sequence of steps that would lead to unsafe scenario. You can assume both traffic light controllers will always work perfectly (as per specification without any malfunction).

Problem 3 An athlete is using an exercise machine as shown.  The handle where the athlete pulls is attached to a cable that wraps around two pulleys before reaching an 80 lb weight.  This exercise involves raising and lowering the weight very slowly.  At the position shown, where the weight has been lifted off its resting base, determine the reactions at points E and F.  A, C and F are pinned connections whereas E is a built-in support.          For all components, give scalar values with units involving lbs and ft.  For any component of reaction that does not exist at a given support, enter NA. Ex = [Ex] Ey = [Ey] ME = [M_E] Fx = [Fx] Fy = [Fy] MF = [M_F]

Mr. Smith is 65 years old and in chronically poor health; he resides in a skilled nursing facility where you work as an SLP.  Over the years, Mr. Smith more or less neglected his health and refused to make lifestyle changes to promote good heart health, despite his physician's warning that he desperately needed to make changes.   About 2 years ago, Mr. Smith had his first stroke.  The stroke was isolated in the frontal lobe and produced only mild deficits in expressive and receptive language; recovery was good following rehab.  After this initial stroke, Mr. Smith had another one about 9 months later that produced moderate, permanent changes in expressive/receptive language skills.   Now, Mr. Smith has suffered a third stroke resulting in global aphasia.  You do not think that Mr. Smith has a good prognosis for recovery, but you must render therapy.  Describe the rationale for providing trial therapy for Mr. Smith.  At one point will you re-evaluate Mr. Smith's progress during trial therapy?

The patient was admitted from home on May 31 with vaginal bleeding.  This is the patient's third admission to labor and delivery during this pregnancy.  The patient is 33 years old, gravida 1, para 0, with 34 completed weeks of gestation, with an estimated due date of confinement of July 9.  She has twin gestation (two placentae and two amniotic sacs)  and complete placenta previa.  Because of this last episode of bleeding, it was decided to keep her at best rest in labor and delivery at the hospital so that, should any further excessive bleeding occur, she would be available for emergency cesarean delivery, if necessary.  The intent was to keep her until she reached 36 weeks gestation as recommended by the perinatologist in consultation.  On June 10 she had bright red bleeding from the vagina.  There were contractions of preterm labor noted.  Because she was one day short of 35 weeks gestation, it was decided to go forward with a primary low cesarean delivery for the incomplete or partial placenta previa with hemorrhage.  She delivered a 4lb, 9oz viable female with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 16:01 pm.  She delivered a 4lb, 15oz viable male with Apgar scores of 7 and 9 at 16:02 pm.  Intraoperative blood loss was approximately 1 liter.  She was anemic due to acute blood loss prior to surgery.  She had a good recovery from the surgery and her hemoglobin stabilized at 8.2 gm.  She was discharged home to follow up in the office in two weeks for an incision check.  Her twin infants remained in the premature nursey for further treatment.

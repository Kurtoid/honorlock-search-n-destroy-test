To study the effectiveness of a new anti-anxiety drug, researchers randomly assign equally anxious people to two groups, one getting Drug X and the other getting no drug. The researchers mistakenly conclude that Drug X works because people in the drug group show fewer signs of anxiety than the others. What is the mistake?

(1). Draw a figure and describe how RFID works? Illustrate its potential applications.  (10pts)   (2). Introduce the frequency hopping spread system and its advantages.  (10pts)   (3). Given a bit sequence 00100110 as follows. The time period of each bit is 2/f1, where f1 is the carrier frequency. Draw their ASK, FSK, BPSK, DPSK modulated output wave respectively. For ASK and PSK, the carrier is assumed to be sin(2pf1t). For FSK, the carrier is sin(2pf1t) for bit 0 and is sin(2pf2t) for bit 1, f1=1/2*f2. For DPSK, the first bit is modulated by sin(2pf1t). (10pts)      (4). What is the basic idea of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the time domain? Why do we need the OFDM? (10pts)           (5). The first figure above demonstrates the framework of the ZigBee transmitter. The second figure above shows the symbol-to-chip mapping happening in the DSSS block in the ZigBee transmitter.  Assume the data bits coming from the MAC layer are ...10100111,  please answer the following questions: (20pts)       (5a). Given the input to the Bit to Symbol Mapping 10100111, what are the output symbols from Bit to Symbol Mapping at A (least significant bit first)?       (5b). What are output chips from DSSS at B?       (5c). What are the output chips from Serial to Parallel Converter at C1 and C2?       (5d). Draw the sine wave of D1 and D2 with the same timeline starting from 0.       (5e). What is the data transmission rate for the input to Bit to Symbol Mapping? What is the chip transmission rate for the output from DSSS?

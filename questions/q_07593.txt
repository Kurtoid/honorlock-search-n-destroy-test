Cannon Corp manufactures three products: X, Y, and Z. The selling price, variable costs, and contribution margin for one unit of each product follow:              Product          X    Y    Z     Selling price    $    180              $    270              $    240           Variable expenses:                                                             Direct materials     $   24               $   80                $   32           Other variable expenses     $   102               $   90               $    148           Total variable expenses     $   126               $   170                $   180           Contribution margin    $    54              $    100              $    60           Contribution margin ratio         30    %              37    %              25    %            The same raw material is used in all three products. Cannon Corp has only 6,000 pounds of raw material on hand and will not be able to obtain any more of it for several weeks due to a strike in its supplier's plant. Management is trying to decide which product(s) to concentrate on next week in filling its backlog of orders. The material costs $8 per pound.  (Type the integer amount. No commas, no decimals Do not type the $ sign.)   the contribution margin per pound of the constraining resource for product X  is  $ [cmX]. the contribution margin per pound of the constraining resource for product Y  is $ [cmY]. the contribution margin per pound of the constraining resource for product Z  is $ [cmZ].  . Assuming that Cannon has unlimited demand for each of its three products,  the maximum contribution margin the company can earn when using the 6,000 pounds of raw material on hand is $ [maxcm1].  Assuming that Cannon's estimated customer demand is 500 units per product line, the maximum contribution margin the company can earn when using the 6,000 pounds of raw material on hand is $ [maxcm2]. A foreign supplier could furnish Cannon with additional stocks of the raw material at a substantial premium over the usual price. Assuming Cannon's estimated customer demand is 500 units per product line and that the company has used its 6,000 pounds of raw material in an optimal fashion, the highest price Cannon Company should be willing to pay for an additional pound of materials is $ [maxcost].

The main reasons for speed control regulations are to make traffic flow more efficiently and to minimize the risk of danger.  One speed control study focused on the distance required to completely stop a vehicle at various speeds.  The data collected during the study was organized into the following table:                             Speed(x) (mph)   Braking distance(y) (feet)     20   20     30   45     40   81     50   133     60   205     80   411     Using your linear regression from question 14, predict the stopping distance at 45 MPH.  Round your answer to 1 decimal place.

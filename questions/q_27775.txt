You have isolated a clone of E.coli that exhibits a requirement for arginine to survive.  However one day while making minimal agar plates, you forget to add the arginine. Your boss briefly scolds you and tells you to start over but before tossing the plates, you spread some of your Arg- culture onto the plates and incubate overnight to see if you can identify any revertants that no longer need arginine. Interestingly, you do! You rush in to show your boss that you have a potentially useful new tool for the lab and you describe them as revertants, but your boss isn't so sure.

9. One thousand photons in a beam are incident on a semi-transparent glass slide at an angle of 100. One hundred and twenty photons are reflected back and lost at the front air-glass interface as well at the rear glass-air interface. Fifty photons are scattered out of the beam by impurities in the glass while the beam is passing through, and 150 are absorbed by the glass material. a) How many photons are in the transmitted beam? b) Compared with the number of photons in the incident beam, what is the percent transmission of this beam through the slide?                                           10. A beam of HeNe laser light at 632.8 nm (from air) is refracted inside a piece of silicon at an angle of 20.500 with the normal. The index of refraction of silicon at this wavelength is near 2.469. a) What is the angle of incidence? b) What is the angle of reflection? c) What is the speed of light in silicon? d) Draw a sketch of the air-silicon interface.                                       11. a) Determine the radiant flux density for a body with an emissivity of 0.47 at a temperature of 4200 F. b) Is this a blackbody or a graybody? Explain. c) If the object is not a graybody, what would the radiant flux density be?                                         12. A Krypton (510 nm) laser with a power of 0.8590 uW and a divergence angle of 1.14 mrad. The laser is projected through a converging lens with a focal length of 120 mm for duration of 0.27 hours. Calculate: a) the minimum optical density of a laser safety goggle needed to protect the eye from damage, and b) the transmission through the laser goggle.                                         13. Determine the spectral flux density emitted by a blackbody at a temperature of 3800 F and a wavelength of 1.064 um.                                         14. A hydrogen atom in excited energy state E4 = -1.36 x 10-19 J drops to the ground state at energy level E2 = -5.45 x 10-19 J, giving off a photon. a) What is the energy of the emitted photon in joules? b) What is its wavelength? c) Based on the EM spectrum, what type of radiation is this?

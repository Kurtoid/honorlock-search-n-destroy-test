Ray, a friend of mine, ask me if could recommend a good lawyer to help him recover money from an embezzlement in his landscaping business. Ray had 30 two-man crews with regular routes providing full-service monthly landscaping to residential and commercial customers. He had one bookkeeper whom prepared checks to pay vendors, billed and collected cash from customers, and processed the payroll. She had worked for him faithfully for thirty years and was retiring within three months. Ray said he spent most Sundays signing all the checks. Ray brought in his daughter to replace the bookkeeper, learn the business, and hopefully take over the business some day. Much to his dismay, his daughter informed Ray the bookkeeper had essentially doubled her own salary while processing the payroll. The bookkeeper claimed that Ray had approved the pay increases which he ferociously denied. Required: Answer the following in the text box below. The bookkeeper prevailed and Ray was not able to recover the embezzled money. Why? List at least two internal control procedures Ray could have used to help mitigate the fraud and explain how these procedures could be implemented in Ray's Business.

An open box (no lid) is to have a square base. The  enclosed volume of this box is to be 864 in3.  The goal of this problem is to find the dimensions that will produce a box that will use as little surface area as possible.  To answer this question, consider the following:  Let x = the length of the base and let y = the height of the box.  a)    You know that volume = length x width x height. Using the given information, write an equation for the volume, then solve it for y.  b)    The surface area is the sum of the areas of all sides. In this situation with no lid, the surface area is S = 4xy + x2.  Substitute what you got for y in (a) and simplify. This is the surface area function, S(x).  c)   Take it from here. Find the dimensions (x and y) that will minimize the surface area. If rounding is necessary, do so to the nearest tenth.

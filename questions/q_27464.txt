QUESTION 2: The League of Nations and Abyssinia Use the following sources to answer the question provided.     SOURCE A   When in 1915 Italy exposed itself to the risks of war, many promises were made. But after the victory, Italy received but a few crumbs. We have been patient for thirteen years. With Abyssinia we have been patient for forty years! It is time to say enough! In the League of Nations there is talk of sanctions rather than recognition of our rights. I refuse to believe that the real people of France can support sanctions against Italy. Similarly, I refuse to believe that the real people of Great Britain are prepared to risk hurling Europe along the road to catastrophe for the sake of defending an African country universally branded as being without the slightest shadow of civilization. We shall face economic sanctions with discipline and our spirit of sacrifice. Against military sanctions we shall reply with military measures. To acts of war we shall reply with acts of war.   From a speech by Benito Mussolini, 2 October 1935.     SOURCE B   The problem before you is not merely about Italian aggression against Abyssinia. It is about collective security. It is about the very existence of the League of Nations. It is about the confidence that each state is to place in international treaties. It is about the value of promises made to small states that their independence shall be respected and ensured. Does the League have value only when the Great Powers have a personal, direct and immediate interest involved? The League's Covenant can have no value if the will to honour it is lacking. I ask the League, which has given the Abyssinian people a promise to help them in their resistance to the aggressor, what is it willing to do for Abyssinia? And to the Great Powers, who have promised the guarantee of collective security to small states on whom weighs the threat that they may one day suffer the fate of Abyssinia, I ask what measures do you intend to take?   From a speech to the League of Nations by Haile Selassie, Emperor of Abyssinia, June 1936.       Question 2 Compare and contrast the views expressed by Benito Mussolini and Haile Selassie regarding the League of Nations' response to Italy's invasion of Abyssinia.

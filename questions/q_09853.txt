Suppose the real risk-free rate is 2.9%, the average future inflation rate is    1.2%, a maturity premium of 0.05% per year to maturity applies, i.e., MRP =    0.05%(t), where t is the years to maturity.  Suppose also that a liquidity premium    of 0.9% and a default risk premium of 0.4% applies to A-rated corporate bonds.     How much higher would the rate of return be on a 9-year A-rated corporate    bond than on a 5-year Treasury bond.  Here we assume that the pure    expectations theory is NOT valid.

What will be McCarthy's new levered beta if it replaces $5 million in equity with debt? b. What will be McCarthy's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) if it utilizes $5 million in debt? c. What is McCarthy's EPS if it issues 5 million in debt?

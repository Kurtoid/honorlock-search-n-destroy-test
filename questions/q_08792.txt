Skill E3.  Consider again the scenario in Skill E2 with no information about contractor FG.  Contractor AB will fail if and only if its workers go on strike.  Imperfect information about this strike is available from a person who works for the labor union.  If the workers will strike, the probability that this person will tell the construction firm that they will strike is 90%; the probability that this person will tell the construction firm that there will be no strike is 10%.  If the workers will not strike, the probability that this person will tell the construction firm that they will strike is 25%; the probability that this person will tell the construction firm that there will be no strike is 75%.  (This provides NO information about whether FG will fail.)What is the expected value of this imperfect information?

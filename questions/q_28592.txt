Le 1er mai Read the description below about the holiday celebrated in France on May 1st and answer the questions in English. Le 1er mai est considere comme la journee internationale des travailleurs ou la fete du Travail. A l'origine, cette journee etait un jour annuel de greve (strike) pour reduire (shorten) le temps de travail. A l'heure actuelle, elle est celebree dans de nombreux pays du monde mais il arrive parfois, comme c'est le cas en Amerique du Nord, qu'on la celebre a un autre moment de l'annee. Au debut du 20eme siecle, les Francais, les Suisses et les Belges ont pris l'habitude, a l'occasion du 1er mai, d'offrir aux amis et aux membres de la famille un petit bouquet de muguet (lily of the valley). Le muguet est le symbole du printemps et represente le retour de l'optimisme. Il est interessant de remarquer que l'administration fiscale autorise la vente du muguet aux travailleurs sans formalites ni taxes (without regulation or tax) le 1er mai. Dans le code du travail, le 1er mai est devenu un jour ferie et paye pour tous les salaries en 1947 mais c'est en avril 1948 qu'on adopte le nom officiel de <<fete du Travail>> en France. De nombreuses manifestations syndicales (trade union) sont organisees dans les grandes villes de France le 1er mai. Why is 1948 a significant year in relation to this holiday in France?

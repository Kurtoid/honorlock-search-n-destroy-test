Considering an un-steady state flow conditions. Find the spacing of the sub-surface drains.  Agricultural drainage criteria:  The maximum permissible depth of the water table is 1 m below the soil surface; and The maximum time that the grass can be flooded is 10 days, and the rainfall amount percolating to the water table is 25 mm for the expected wetting event. Immediately after the wetting event the water table level is allowed to reach a depth of 1 m from the surface. With the sub-surface drains, the water table is intended to be lowered to a depth of 1.5 m from the surface.  Technical design criteria:  Drains are installed at a depth of 1.8 m; and PVC drain pipes with an effective radius of 0.10 m are used (no trench case)  Soil data:  The depth of the impervious layer is 9.5 m below the soil surface; and The average hydraulic conductivity of the soil is 1.0 m/day and the drainable porosity is 0.05.

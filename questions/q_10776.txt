A candidate for public office distributes an 8 1/2 x 11 inch flyer that reproduces a movie poster of a famous actor portraying a popular action hero. The original poster shows the muscular, shirtless image of the actor, with an automatic weapon in each hand and additional weapons and ammunition strapped to his chest and hips. However, the flyer replaces the actor's head with the head of the candidate's opponent, who is well-known for his opposition to gun control. The owner of the copyright in the movie poster sues the candidate for copyright infringement. Assuming that each of the following statements is factually correct, which presents the strongest case for treating this work as a parody for purposes of fair use?

Kick Scooters Metal frames for kick scooters are manufactured in two steps: Stamping and assembly. Each frame is made up of three pieces: one unit of part A and two units of part B.   The parts are fabricated by a single stamping machine that requires a set up time of 90 minutes switching between two part types. Once the machine is set up, the activity time for parts, regardless of type, is 30 seconds each piece.  Currently, the stamping machine rotates its production between one batch of 120 part A's and 240 part B's. Completed parts move only when the entire batch is produced. At assembly, parts are assembled manually to form the finished products. The three parts and a number of small purchased components are required for each unit of final product. Each product requires 30 minutes of labor time to assemble. There are 12 workers in assembly. There is sufficient demand to sell every scooter the system can make. At the current batch sizes, what is the capacity of stamping (in units per hour)

XYZ Inc. manufactures a variety of motors for use in boats.  The company has always produced all of the necessary parts for its motors, including all of the pistons (14,000 pistons are produced each year).

To evaluate this offer, XYZ has gathered the following information relating to its own costs of producing a piston internally:      Per Unit     Direct materials  $       14     Direct labor           10     Variable manufacturing overhead             4     Fixed manufacturing overhead, traceable             6 see note below   Fixed manufacturing overhead, allocated             9     Total cost  $       43      Note: $2 of the traceable Fixed MOH is supervisory salaries,and $4 is depreciation of special equipment (no resale value) Assuming the company has no alternative use for the facilities that are now being used to produce the pistons, what would be the financial advantage (disadvantage) of buying 14,000 pistons from the outside supplier?

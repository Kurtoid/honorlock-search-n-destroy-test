Integrative A 3 Skyler is interested in studying the effect of modeling on aggression during play in 5-year-old children.  She has one group of children watch a video of two 8-year-olds playing with stuffed animals.  The children handle the toys roughly: they throw them around the room, hit each other with the animals, and one child pulls the ears off of one of the toys.  Skyler has a second group of children watch the same video, except this time the children in the video handle the stuffed animal toys very gently.  Skyler then measures the number of aggressive play behaviors the participant children exhibit during a 30-minute test.  Because Skyler is concerned that her participants' baseline aggressive tendencies could affect the outcome of the experiment, she uses pairs of children who have already been matched for aggression level (from scores on a pretest of aggressive behavior).  Test whether aggressive handling of the toys in the models increases aggressive play behavior in the 5-year-olds.  Use an alpha of .01.

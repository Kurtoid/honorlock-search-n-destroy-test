Use the following information and figure to answer the question(s) below.The sea slug Pteraeolidia ianthina (P. ianthina) can harbor living dinoflagellates (photosynthetic protists) in its skin. These endosymbiotic dinoflagellates reproduce quickly enough to maintain their populations. Low populations do not affect the sea slugs very much, but high populations (> 5 x 105 cells/mg of sea slug protein) can promote sea slug survival.Percent of sea slug respiratory carbon demand provided by indwelling dinoflagellates.According to the graph, during which season(s) of the year is the relationship between the sea slug and its dinoflagellates closest to being commensal?

Carbon tetrachloride, CCl4, was once used as a dry cleaning solvent, but is no longer used because it is carcinogenic. At 57.8 degC, the vapor pressure of CCl4 is 54.0 kPa, and its enthalpy of vaporization is 33.05 kJ/mol. Use this information to estimate the normal boiling point for CCl4 in degC. (Use R = 8. 31 J/mol.K

1.  For  f(x) = (sinh x - sin x)/(cosh x - cos x),  a)   (6 pts) Calculator uses Taylor series expansion for exponential and trigonometric functions at x=0. Consider a calculator with a machine epsilon of 5x10-11. For what range of x will the numerator of f(x) become 0 on this calculator? b)   (10 pts) Perform Taylor series expansion for each of the four functions involved near x=0 in a consistent manner and express the result in the form of                                     f(x) = ax(1+bxn+...)

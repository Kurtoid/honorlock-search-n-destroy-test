Write a function called springBreak() that takes in one parameter: a dictionary of activities. Each key is a spring break activity (str) that maps to a list of people (str) who want to do the activity. The function should return a tuple with the most popular activity (str) as the first element and the number of people who signed up for that activity (int) as the second element. Popularity is determined by how many people signed up for each activity. Note: Two activities will never have the same number of people signed up.   Example Output #1: >>> actDict = {"sleepover": ["Peter", "Raj"], "beach day" : ["Michael", "Caitlin", "Arushi"], "cook out": ["Parul", "Alexa", "Craig", "Fareeda"]}>>> springBreak(actDict)("cook out", 4)  Example Output #2: >>> actDict = {"escape room" : ["Arvin", "Anthony"],"ultimate frisbee" : ["Arvin", "Alex", "Brian"], "mario kart" : ["Alexa"]}>>> springBreak(actDict)("ultimate frisbee", 3)

The rating is to be determined for the heat exchanger illustrated in the sketch.  The conductance, UA, is 14,400 Btu/hr[?]oF.  The conditions are as follows: T_inlet, hot = 350 F; T_inlet,cold = 150 F mdot_hot = 8.334 lbm/s; mdot_cold = 4 lbm/s cp_hot = 0.24 BTU/lbm-R; cp_cold = 1.00 Btu/lbm-R   The maximum heat transfer is: (Express your answer as numerical only no units.  The magnitude corresponding to units of Btu/s should be used.)

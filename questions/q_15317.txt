As tetrapods, bullfrogs transport oxygen bound mainly to hemoglobin (Hb) in their blood.  The relationship between oxygen's partial pressure () and Hb results in the Hb-oxygen dissociation curve, like the one shown above for bullfrogs and tadpoles.  Based on this figure, oxygen binds most tightly to Hb when  is [value].  The curve itself can shift left when temperature [change].  The result of a left shift is that Hb binds [tightness] to oxygen.

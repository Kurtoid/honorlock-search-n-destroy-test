Snow removal and disposal are important and expensive activities in Maddison, as it is in many northern cities.  While snow can be cleared from streets and sidewalks by plowing and shoveling, in prolonged subfreezing temperatures, the resulting banks of accumulated snow can impede both foot and vehicle traffic and must be removed. To allow timely removal and disposal of snow, a city divided up into several sectors, and snow removal operations are carried out concurrently in each sector.  In Maddison, accumulated snow is loaded into trucks and hauled away to disposal sites (e.g., rivers, lakes, quarries, sewers chutes and holding areas).  For contractual reasons, each sector can only haul snow to a single disposal site.  However, a disposal site may receive snow from multiple sectors.  The different disposal sites can accommodate various amounts of snow due to either physical limitations or environmental restrictions (often removed snow it contaminated with salt and chemicals) limiting the amount that can be dumped into natural systems like rivers.  The annual capacities for 5 different snow disposal sites are given in the table below (in 1,000s of cubic meters).     Disposal Sites  1 2 3 4 5   Capacity 350 250 500 400 200    The cost of removing and disposing of snow depends mainly on the distance it must be trucked.  For planning purposes, the city of Maddison uses straight-line distance between the center of each sector to each disposal site as an approximation of the cost involved in transporting snow between these locations.  The following table summarizes these distances (in kilometers) for 10 sectors in the city (metric Yeah!).        Disposal Sites     Sectors 1 2 3 4 5   1 3.4 1.4 4.9 7.4 9.3   2 2.4 2.1 8.3 9.1 8.8   3 1.4 2.9 3.7 9.4 8.6   4 2.6 3.6 4.5 8.2 8.9   5 1.5 3.1 2.1 7.9 8.8   6 4.2 4.9 6.5 7.7 6.1   7 4.8 6.2 9.9 6.2 5.7   8 5.4 6.0 5.2 7.6 4.9   9 3.1 4.1 6.6 7.5 7.2   10 3.2 6.5 7.1 6.0 8.3    Using historic snowfall data, the city is able to estimate the annual volume of snow requiring removal in each sector.  It does this by assuming each linear meter of street in a sector will generate 4 cubic meters of snow annually.  the follow table is the estimated snow removal requirement for each sector for the coming year (in 1,000s of cubic meters).    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10   153 152 154 138 127 129 111 110 130 135    Create a spreed sheet the Maddison could use to determine the most efficient snow removal plan for the coming year.  Assume it cost $0.10 to transport 1 cubic meter of snow 1 kilometer.  Submit the spreadsheet below.

The excerpt below was taken from a Science Daily Article a few years ago.  It discusses work done at The Scripps Research Institute that allowed for determination of the high resolution atomic structure of CCR5 and CXCR4: Marketed for HIV infection since 2007, the drug maraviroc grabs hold of CCR5 in a way that prevents HIV from using the receptor to get into cells. "Maraviroc was thought to lock CCR5 into an inactive shape, and so we wanted to 'see' that shape at high resolution," said Dr. Beili Wu. Based on the excerpt above, you can tell that the drug maraviroc prevents the binding of _________ to CCR5.

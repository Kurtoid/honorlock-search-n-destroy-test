Harlem By: Langston Hughes   What happens to a dream deferred?                   Does it dry up                 like a raisin in the sun?

He had no other medical expenses that year. A) How much if any deduction is Rick allowed under SS 213 in 2020, and B) He is thinking about selling the home next year. What is his adjusted basis in the home after installation of the filtration system and any SS213 deduction he is allowed?

All men recognize the right revolution; that is the right to refuse allegiance to, and to resist, the government, when its tyranny or inefficiency are great and unendurable. But almost all say that such is not the case now. But such was the case, they think, in the Revolution of '75. If one were to tell me that this was a bad government because it taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its parts, it is most probable that I should not make ado about it, for I can do without them. All machines have their friction; and possibly this does enough good to counter-balance the evil. At any rate, it is a great evil to make a stir about it. But when the friction comes to have its machine, and oppression and robbery are organized, I say, let us not have such a machine any longer. In other words, when a sixth of the population of a nation which has undertaken to be the refuge of liberty are slaves, and a whole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army, and subjected to military law, I think that it is not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize. What makes this duty the more urgent is the fact that the country so overrun is not our own, but ours is the invading army.

Let us consider the example analogous to the peacock tails we discussed in class-  cichlids, a type of freshwater fish that engages in costly mating displays and rearing of young.  Assume a cichlid male has a 50% chance of being fit and a 50% chance of being unfit.     A female cichlid receives a utility of 10 from mating with a fit male cichlid from offspring that are likely to survive, but a payoff of -15 for mating with an unfit male cichlid that cannot help guard eggs and investing resources in offspring that are much less likely to survive. Now let us assume the male cichlids exert effort on mating displays.  Both fit and unfit males receive a utility of 10 if chosen for mating, 0 otherwise, but pay different costs for mating displays- fit males expend less utility for the same effort of dancing and nest building:  Cost of effort for a fit cichlid: s +1 Cost of effort for an unfit cichlid: s^2 +1  Where s is the amount of effort expended.  Males can mate only once.  The female fish can observe the effort expended but not the expenders type.  What amount of effort must a female cichlid observe before considering selecting a mate?  Assume there are a sufficient number of female cichlids that if a male is deemed fit or worth risking they selected.

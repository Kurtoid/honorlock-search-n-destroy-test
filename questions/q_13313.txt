From the figure shown, an ____#31____ synapse is shown in region "V" and when a neurotransmitter is released from the pre-synaptic neuron it will bind to a ___#32______ receptor causing a graded potential which is a small, decremental ____#33______.  If the same axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron stimulates the post-synaptic neuron multiple times in quick succession, _____#34______ would occur at the _____#35_______ and if the membrane potential reaches threshold (-55mV) this would stimulate firing of an action potential along the length of the axon.

A farmer making grape juice fills a glass bottle to the brim and caps it tightly. The juice expands more than the glass when it warms up, in such a way that the volume increases by 0.25% (that is, DV/V0=2.5x10-3) relative to the space available. Calculate the force exerted by the juice per square centimeter (in N/cm2) if its bulk modulus is 1.75 x 109 N/m2, assuming the bottle does not break.

Your liabilities have a present value (market value) of $100 million and an average duration of 3.  For your assets you may choose some combination of one-year zero coupon bonds and five-year zero coupon bonds.  The market value of your assets must equal the market value of your liabilities.  If X equals the amount that you invest in one-year coupon bonds and Y equals the amount that you invest in five-year zero coupon bonds, it must be true that X + Y = $100 million.   The average duration of your assets must also equal the average duration of your liabilities.  Which of the following equations must then also be satisfied by X and Y?

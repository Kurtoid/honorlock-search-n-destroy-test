A future astronaut on Mars rolls a hoop (hollow cylinder) of radius 0.77 m and mass of 2.2 kg along a flat friction surface at 1.8 m/s and then it starts to roll up a frictionless incline 28o above the horizontal.  (The acceleration of gravity on Mars is 3.711 m/s2.)  How high above the flat surface does it roll before starting to roll back?

Please use the Heparin Protocol to answer the questions. WEIGHT ADJUSTED HEPARIN PROTOCOLLab Orders:  STAT: PT, INR, PTT, CBC  STAT: PTT 6 hours after any Heparin BOLUS or rate adjustment.  PTT every 6 hours until two (2) consecutive PTTs are therapeutic (46 to 70). Then change PTT to every 24 hours.  Stop Heparin infusion if platelet count is less than 100,000 or platelet count drops by 50% pre-Heparin level, and notify healthcare provider.   STEPS IN CALCULATING HEPARIN DOSAGE (INITIAL DOSAGE)  Change weight in pounds to kilograms.  Calculate IV Bolus Heparin at 80 units/kg (80 units per kg).   On hand: Heparin 5000 units/1 ml   Calculate IV Heparin continuous infusion at 18 units/kg/hr (18 units per kg per hr).   On hand: Heparin continuous infusion 25,000 units in 250 ml D5W.  Adjust Heparin infusion rate based on the sliding scale below (after the initial dosing and based upon subsequent PTTs):       PTT   UNITS OF HEPARIN      90    STOP Heparin for 1 hour, Then reduce Heparin infusion by 3 units/kg/hr.        A 295 pound patient is currently on a Heparin drip at {x} ml/hr. The current lab is: PTT 88. The new infusion rate will be ___________ ml/hr. Record your answer using 1 decimal place(s). Enter only a number in the blank.

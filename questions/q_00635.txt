In the figure shown below, a 1.2 kg block is held at rest against a spring with a force constant of 730 N/m. Initially. the spring is compressed a distance "d". When the block is released, it slides across a surface that is frictionless, except for a rough patch of width 5.0 cm that has a coefficient of kinetic friction 0.44. If the speed of the block right after crossing the rough patch is 2.3 m/s, what was the initial compression of the spring?

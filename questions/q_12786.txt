Which of the following paraphrases is plagiarism? (1)The brain consolidates learning during two particular phases of sleep. (2)According to Dr. Robert Stickgold of Harvard University Medical School, who conducted a series of tests involving visual tasks, the brain seems to need lots of slow-wave sleep and a good chunk of another kind of sleep, Rapid Eye Movement, or REM. (3)Dr. Stickgold hypothesizes that the reason the brain needs these particular kinds of sleep is that certain brain chemicals plummet during the first part of the night, and information flows out of the hippocampus (the memory region) and into the cortex. (4)He thinks the brain then distributes the new information into appropriate networks and categories. (5)Inside the brain, proteins strengthen the connections between nerve cells consolidating the new skills learned the day before. (6)Then later, during REM, the brain re-enacts the lessons from the previous day and solidifies the newly-made connections through the memory banks. Works Cited Spinks, Sarah.

Consider a compact file system called CFS that tries to save as much space as possible within file i-nodes. To point to files, the file i-node stores only a single 32-bit pointer to the first block of the file. However, blocks within CFS store 4,092 bytes of user data and a 32-bit next field (much like a linked list), and thus can point to a subsequent block (or to NULL, indicating there is no more data. What is the maximum file size for CFS? You may provide an athematic equation without having to reduce the equation into a single number.

Long Answer: Write 6-8 sentences (one-two small paragraphs). If you quote from the passage, please use quotation marks. Page numbers have been provided below.   How does Bronte describe Rochester in this final scene? In what ways has Rochester been physically changed and how is his demeanor different?  Based on this excerpt and the ending as you remember it, does Bronte frame Rochester as a redeemable character? In what ways have both he and Jane paid for their (or his) transgression of social and religious conventions?  Reflecting on the ending in general, how do you think a Victorian audience might respond to Jane's decision to return to Rochester, and how does Bronte use this excerpt to help frame that response?      From Chapter 37, pp 627-628 His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.

He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the grass-plat. Where was his daring stride now? Then he paused, as if he knew not which way to turn. He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness. He stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off where he stood. He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.

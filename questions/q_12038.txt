A long vertical wire carries a steady 70 A current. As shown in the figure, a pair of horizontal rails are 0.20 m apart. A 20-O resistor connects points a and b, at the end of the rails. A bar is in contact with the rails, and is moved by an external force with a constant horizontal velocity of 0.90 m/s to the right, as shown. The bar and the rails have negligible resistance. At the instant that the bar is 0.20 m from the wire, what are the induced current in the resistor and its direction through the resistor? (m0 = 4p x 10-7 T [?] m/A)

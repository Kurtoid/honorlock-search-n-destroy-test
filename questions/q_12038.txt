According to Equivalence Class Partitioning, what are the partitions for heart rate (HR)?Valid HR is Greater than or Equal to 0 (zero) and Equal to or Less than 200. HR is considered high if Greater than 150? HR is an integer. (2p) Consider the test cases you defined in the MC/DC question elsewhere in this test. Assume that the expression is embedded in a function with input validation where negative input and input larger than 200 is rejected and has been tested to be working. Assume that A means (HR>150), that B means (System==On), and that C means (Session==Started). Populate the test cases with values for HR, System and Session, derived using basic Boundary Value Analysis and the partitions you defined above). Note: System and Session are binary. How many populated test cases do we need? Provide all unpopulated  as well as populated test cases. Show your calculations and provide clear links between unpopulated  and populated test cases and motivate your answers. Use Table Option, below, if needed. (5p).   Max 200 words, excluding tables.

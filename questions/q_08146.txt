The supplies are put into inventory. Invoices for the supplies purchased above are paid. Employee salaries for the year amounting to $345,000 are paid. The ISF makes a payment of $41,000 for defined contribution pensions for its personnel. The ISF receives an invoice of $28,000 from the General Fund for rent costs, which includes space and utility costs. The ISF sends invoices throughout the year to several Town agencies for printing services, as follows: $575,000 to General Fund departments and $9,500 to the Water Enterprise Fund. The ISF receives payments of $555,000 from General Fund agencies and $9,500 from the Water Enterprise Fund. At year-end, the ISF records one year's depreciation on the equipment purchased above. The ISF records the expense of paper and supplies consumed during the year. A year-end inventory showed unused paper and supplies amounting to $8,000. The ISF accrues unpaid salaries of $13,500.

Redbud Heating, Inc. v. West Dakota Unemployment Compensation Agency  Supreme Court of West Dakota   You are a Justice of the five-member West Dakota Supreme Court, the state's appellate court of last resort, which is now poised to decide a case that raises significant issues of both statutory interpretation and deference to agency interpretations.    In this case, appellant Redbud Heating, Inc. (Redbud) appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing its appeal from the decision of the Employment Review Board (Board) of the appellee West Dakota Unemployment Compensation Agency (Agency).  Redbud argues that the trial court wrongly affirmed the Board's conclusion that certain heating installation workers qualify as Redbud's "employees" for the purpose of state taxes owed under the West Dakota Unemployment Compensation Act (Act).  Due to this classification, the Agency assessed $62,400 in unpaid employment taxes against Redbud for the years 2017 and 2018.   Redbud argues that the installers are not employees, but independent contractors, on whose work Redbud does not owe any employment tax.    The Board's memorandum of decision set forth the following facts:    Redbud, a family-owned business based in Center City, West Dakota, is in the business of selling and delivering home heating systems to residential customers throughout West Dakota.  In doing so, it utilizes the services of certain individuals who install and service the heating systems.  Whether these installation workers should be classified as "employees" under the Act or, instead, as independent contractors is the basic issue in this case.   Redbud's promotional materials advertise the availability of "installation" of customers' heating systems, and about 80% of Redbud customers who purchase heating systems do request the installation service.  The rest make arrangements with another individual or entity to have their systems installed.   When a customer requests installation, Redbud agrees on an appointment time with the customer and then finds an individual installer who can take the assignment.  All installers must be validly licensed heating/air technicians under the laws of West Dakota.  The installers are free to accept or reject assignments, and they provide their own tools and transportation to customers' residences.  Some installers work exclusively on installations for Redbud, while others have additional customers.  Redbud does not supervise the installers during the work, although it can require an installer to return to correct a deficient installment.  The installers are paid a set rate per installation, based on invoices that they submit to Redbud.     Memorandum, p. 2.     Prior to 2015, the Act simply used the term "employees" without any definition.  Added in 2015, and still in effect today, Section 222(1) of the Act defines "employees" as follows:    Individuals performing a service shall be deemed to be employees under this Act unless and until it is shown that both:    (A) such individual is free from control and direction in connection with the performance of such service; and   (B) such service is performed outside of all of the places of business of the enterprise for which the service is performed.     41 W. D. Rev. Stat. SS 222(1) (2015).  Because of the joint requirements in subsections (A) and (B) above for independent contractor status, the current statutory test for employment is commonly referred to as the "AB Test."    In 2019, an auditor from the state Unemployment Compensation Agency conducted an audit of Redbud and concluded that Redbud had misclassified its installers as independent contractors, when they were really its employees within the meaning of the Act.  Redbud sought review from the Agency's three-member appellate tribunal (the Board), which considered written submissions and documentation from each side.     The Board affirmed the auditor's conclusions, concluding that the matter was controlled by one of its own previous agency decisions applying the amended SS 222(1).  In Matter of A.R.P. Enterprises Inc. (2016), the Board had held that tutors who were paid by a business education company, on a per-session basis, to teach instructional sessions at the sites of the company's customers were "employees" of the company within the meaning of 222(1).  The Board concluded in A.R.P. that the customers' sites were "places of business" of the company within the meaning of subsection (B) of the AB Test; thus the tutors could not qualify as independent contractors.  The Board reasoned that the company was in the education business, so the places where its materials were taught were places where it conducted its business.  Moreover, A.R.P. reasoned, this reading would best carry out the purposes of the amended statute: "There is nothing inherent in work carried out in dispersed locations that renders those who perform it less subject to unemployment, and the hardships it causes, than those who work in fixed locations maintained by their employers" - thus, companies who benefit from such dispersed workers should be required to contribute to unemployment taxes.     Turning to the present case, the Board, citing A.R.P., concluded that Redbud's installers qualified as employees because the customers' residences were among Redbud's "places of business" under the Act: Redbud was in the residential heating business and indeed often delivered the heating systems to customer's residences.               Redbud has sought judicial review of the agency's determination by your court, as allowed by West Dakota judicial procedure.  In its brief, Redbud argues that (1) the Agency's interpretation of the statutory AB Test is not entitled to any deference here; and (2) properly interpreted, the statute does not classify Redbud's installers as employees, so Redbud owed no tax on them.     The Agency disagrees on both counts, arguing (1) that its interpretation of the statute, announced through the Board's consistent decisions, is entitled to the strongest form of judicial deference, and (2) that its interpretation is clearly correct even if deference were not to apply here.                  The contending parties point to several sources of evidence potentially bearing on the meaning of the statute.  First, the Agency notes that the 2015 statutory amendment added the current ('AB Test') definition of "employee" to the Act at a time when West Dakota had an unemployment rate of 9.9%, one of the five highest rates in the nation.  The Agency also cites a number of newspaper editorials and other media articles from the same time period expressing concern about the shaky financial solvency of the state's unemployment benefits fund, which is funded by the employment taxes gathered under the Act.     The then-Speaker of the West Dakota House of Representatives, an important supporter of the 2015 amendment, stated in a floor speech that "This amendment will greatly strengthen the coverage of our state unemployment tax.  We are adopting a broader approach in our State than under federal law, which focuses solely on whether or not the employer exercises control and direction over the work."  That was an accurate description of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service's approach at the time to classifying workers as "employers" for federal tax purposes.   While "place of business" is not defined in the text of the Act, Black's Law Dictionary defines a "place of business" as "a location at which one carries on a business."  Also, a different section of the Act, Section 237, sets out differing levels of reporting requirements that apply to business businesses based on the number of "employees" they have at a given time.  This section provides that "a contractor or subcontractor" who "performs work at premises that are under the control of the employer" shall be counted as an employee for the purpose of determining what reporting requirements the employer must follow, "regardless of the treatment of such contractor under the other provisions of this Act."  W. D. Rev. Stat. 41-237(4).                          Alongside the aforementioned statutory interpretation question, this case also raises a related question of administrative law that your court must address.  Is the Agency's interpretation of the statutory test entitled to deference?  And if so, what kind?  Traditionally, West Dakota state courts have followed federal law in this area.  They have followed the identical "deference" frameworks for evaluating agency interpretations that the United States Supreme Court has applied to federal agency interpretations of statutes.  The parties have framed most of their arguments in terms of this body of law, with the Agency arguing for the highest level of deference and Redbud arguing that this court should give a lower, or no level of deference to the Agency's decision.[1]               After oral argument and discussion with your colleagues, you have been assigned to write the majority opinion in this case.  However, you also have reason to believe at least one of your colleagues plans to take a different approach.              This problem has two parts:    Write the majority opinion for the court that reaches what you think is the correct outcome in this case.  Your opinion should be concise, but it should make clear what steps you are taking to resolve the statutory interpretation issue, and it should also (perhaps first?) resolve the question of "deference to agencies" explained in the problem.    Explain your reasoning and respond to likely counterarguments, showing why you do not find them persuasive here.  Use the case law we have studied as persuasive authority where appropriate. (40 points)    Next, you (the student reading this) should write a separate, concurring or dissenting opinion in which one or more other Justices analyze the case differently from how the majority opinion (= your own) did.    This separate opinion should reflect and employ a different approach to statutory interpretation from the one used in your majority opinion, and it should respond to the lead opinion's arguments.  It might also need to separately address the "deference to agencies" issue, if that's helpful to understand its reasoning.   At your choice, this second opinion can be either a concurring opinion ( = reaching the same bottom-line outcome as the majority opinion, but using a different analysis to get there) or a dissenting opinion ( = using a different analysis and also reaching the opposite outcome).   Or it could be an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.  Any of these choices is fine, as long as the resultant opinion meets the other requirements in this instruction.   (30 points)             [1] NOTE: In addition, as a backup argument, Redbud also urges that this Court should overrule its prior decisions and reject the federal framework of agency deference, which, it claims, often produces excessive judicial deference, in a way that makes the law unpredictable and interferes with the constitutional separation of powers.   If you wish, the Court may address this backup argument in its opinion.

The cardiotonic steroids, digitoxin and ouabain used in low dosages, help to increase the strength of the heartbeat in heart muscle cells. These drugs act by increasing the Na+ concentration in the cytosol and the cell compensates for the increased Na+ by activating Na+-Ca2+ exchanger resulting in a high concentration of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (endoplasmic reticulum) of the heart muscle cell. Which of the following if inhibited would lead to an INCREASE in Na+ concentration in the cytosol of the heart muscle cell? In other words, what is the cellular target for these drugs?

You can use any calculator or there is a scientific calculator in the browser. Note that you cannot print out the periodic table or equation page during the exam. Make sure you have paper and pencil so you can show your work. After you finish the exam, you must upload a scan (pdf file) of your work within 15 minutes. Be ready to do this (but no phones, etc. allowed during the exam)! Many of the questions will ask you to show your work on paper to get full credit. This will also allow me to give you credit on certain problems if your answer was correct but marked wrong because you used incorrect sig figs, for example. This time is NOT for finishing the exam - no credit for work that doesn't match the exam answers. Write your name on every page. You must label the work for each question that requires work using the question number and circle your answer. Don't cram this into a small space - spread it out and make it easily readable for Dr Sue. On your work, don't forget to use correct sig figs and put units on every number and each answer. There will be a penalty up to zero points for these problems if you do not upload of work that supports your answer. Some of the problems require manual grading therefore no score will be shown when you finish! I may decide to curve the results or alter question points if necessary. The beginning has two links for you to open. One page has a periodic table, the second one has useful information such as equations and constants, Aufbau mnemonic, solubility rules and activity series. These will all open in a new window so you can tab back and forth between the pages. Note that I expect you to use the atomic masses on this periodic table. After you finish the exam, you must upload a scan (pdf file) of your work within 20 minutes. Many of the questions will ask you to show your work on paper to get full credit. This will also allow me to give you credit on certain problems if your answer was correct but marked wrong because you used incorrect sig figs, for example.

Introduction to Statistics - Test 3 Show working please    State the Central Limit Theorem.                                        Suppose x has a distribution with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 3. Random samples of size n=36 are drawn. What is the mean and standard error of the sampling distribution of  the  sample mean.                     Assume that women's heights are normally distributed with mean 5'3"and            standard deviation 3".  What is the probability that a random sample of 16          women has an average height greater than 5'6" ?                                    What are the conditions for the normal distribution to be used as an            approximation to the binomial distribution ? What is the mean and            standard deviation of the approximating normal distribution?                                  Suppose we have a binomial experiment with n=40 trials and probability of      success p=0.85. Estimate Prob( r

Environmental Case Study: Use the following case study to answer the question in bold: The effect of pesticides on human health in community setting may be acute or chronic. The effects may be neurologic, immunologic, neoplastic, reproductive, behavioral, or developmental. In mild cases, pesticide toxicity may be mistaken for the flu. Usually pesticide poisonings go unreported or unrecognized. A public health nurse receives reports from primary care offices that several children who go to the same school have flu-like symptoms. The children have subsequently been examined at the school-based clinic and were found to have headaches, burning eyes and skin rashes.   Considering there is no known origin of exposure, using the scenario in the case study, what stage of the nursing process will come next?

Use the following prompt to answer questions 1A & 1B: 1) Instrument Rental. Katherine rents a single expensive instrument to customers. If customers request the instrument when it is currently rented to someone else, then those customers will place a reservation for a certain number of rental days, and then wait as long as it takes for their turn to rent the instrument. A customer keeps the instrument for an average of 30 days. The standard deviation of the rental period is also 30 days. This 30-day average rental period does not include instrument shipping times. It always takes Katherine exactly 5 days to crate and ship the instrument to a customer, and exactly another 5 days to ship the instrument back from the customer to Katherine. (Katherine never ships the instrument straight from one customer to another customer.) Katherine's records indicate that she rents the instrument to an average of 8 customers per year; for ease of computation, please use a 360-day year. The standard deviation of the interarrival time is 45 days.

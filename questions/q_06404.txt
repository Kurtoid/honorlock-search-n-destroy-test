Define electrochemical gradient. (Learning Objective 7, page 9)
Two different genes are located on the SAME chromosome, relatively close together:  a gene for plant height and a gene for leaf size.  "Tallness" (T) is dominant to "shortness" (t) and "big leaves" (B) is dominant to "small leaves" (b).  If one chromosome of a homologous pair has the T allele at the gene for plant height and a B allele at the gene from leaf size, and if the other chromosome of the homologous pair has the t allele at the plant height gene and a b allele at the leaf size gene, the plant's genotype is TtBb.  What gametes would you expect this plant to produce?

Use the provided worksheet for integer division. Fill the table out using a dividend of 3(000000112) and a divisor of 2 (00102). The initial values are already .  Fill in every cell when the value changes.

Shift Quotient to the left 1 bit and place a 1 in the right most bit of the Quotient.     2b: Remainder is less than zero.  Add Divisor to Remainder and place the results in the Remainder.  This restores the remainder value.  Shift Quotient to the left one bit and place a zero in the right most bit of the Quotient.

Most jobs seem like they can be done by robots or computers. Robot Teachers  If you think of the jobs robots could never do, you would probably put doctors and teachers at the top of the list. It's easy to imagine robot cleaners and factory workers, but some jobs need human connection and creativity. But are we underestimating what robots can do? In some cases, they already perform better than doctors at diagnosing illness. Also, some patients might feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than a person. Could there be a place for robots in education after all?  British education expert Anthony Seldon thinks so. And he even has a date for the robot takeover of the classroom: 2027. He predicts robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be like assistants. Intelligent robots will read students' faces, movements and maybe even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It's not a popular opinion and it's unlikely robots will ever have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans like another human can.   One thing is certain, though. A robot teacher is better than no teacher at all. In some parts of the world, there aren't enough teachers and 9-16 percent of children under the age of 14 don't go to school. That problem could be partly solved by robots because they can teach anywhere and won't get stressed, or tired, or move somewhere for an easier, higher-paid job.   Those negative aspects of teaching are something everyone agrees on. Teachers all over the world are leaving because it is a difficult job and they feel overworked. Perhaps the question is not 'Will robots replace teachers?' but 'How can robots help teachers?' Office workers can use software to do things like organize and answer emails, arrange meetings and update calendars. Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could cut the time teachers spend marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for the parts of the job humans do best.

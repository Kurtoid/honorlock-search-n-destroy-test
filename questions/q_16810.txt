Individual cells detect and respond to diverse external molecular and physical signals. Appropriate responses to these signals are essential for normal development, maintenance of homeostasis in mature tissues, and effective defensive responses to potentially noxious agents. It is convenient, if somewhat arbitrary, to distinguish responses to signals involved in development and homeostasis from several events, which may include stress responses. What external stimulation is required by mammalian cells to progress through the cycle after they have passed the restriction point?

The graph below represents the dose response curves of insect pests for four different pesticides.    The United States Environmental Protection Agency has determined that all four pesticides could have negative health consequences to humans if applied at high concentrations and has set a maximum application concentration of 500g/cm3. Based on the data in the graph, which pesticide would be the most effective at that concentration?

Suppose that you consider a risky investment over two-year investment horizon. In two years from now, it is expected that the cash-flow of your investment would be $50,000 or $150,000 with equal probability of 0.5. Assume that the risk-free rate is 2% per year. How much would you pay today for this investment if you require the risk premium of 5% per year?

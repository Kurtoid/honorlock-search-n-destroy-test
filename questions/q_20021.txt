A shell-and-tube heat exchanger with one shell pass and 20 tube passes uses hot water on the tube side to heat oil on the shell side. The single copper tube has inner and outer diameters of 20 and 24 mm and a length per pass of 3 m. The water enters at 87degC and 0.2 kg/s and leaves at 27degC. Inlet and outlet temperatures of the oil are 7 and 37degC. What is the average convection coefficient for the tube outer surface? Hints: Assume the water is flowing in a smooth tubing and fully developed fluid region. Use the equation for internal convection in chapter 8 to obtain the average heat convection coefficient for the cold fluids.

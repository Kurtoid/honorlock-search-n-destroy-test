QUESTION  7     A group of five learners in a Physics lesson demonstrated the diffraction of waves using a monochromatic red light with a wavelength of 675 x 10-9 m. The red light was passed through the slit with a width of 3,2 x 10-5 m and fell on a screen at a distance of 2,5 cm.     Right click on the button below to open the image in a new tab.      7.1   Define the term constructive interference.   (2)     7.2   Write down Huygens's Principle.   (2)     7.3   On the screen, bright and dark bands were observed:         7.3.1   What do these bright and dark bands on the screen represent?   (2)     7.3.2   How does the width of the central band change if the width of the slit is changed to 3,2 x 10-7m? Write down only NARROWER, BROADER or EQUAL.   (2)     7.4   A red light was replaced with a blue light. How would this change of colour affect the following? Write down only INCREASES, DECREASES or REMAIN THE SAME.         7.4.1   The wavelength.   (1)     7.4.2   Degree of diffraction.   (1)             [10]

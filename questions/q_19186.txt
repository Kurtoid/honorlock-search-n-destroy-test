A lab in GaTech refines, a mixture of poly-Lactic acid (PLA), a catalyst (C ), water (W), and an organic impurity (OI) to produce a high concentrated PLA mixture. The refining unit (refiner) function is described here: A stream of raw materials (stream: R) containing 13.2 wt% the organic impurity, 4.4 wt PLA, 15.4 wt% catalyst and the rest water, enters the refiner. Also, another stream (stream: C) which contains 15 wt% catalyst (C ) and the rest water, with mass flow rate of 132 g/day enters the refiner. A stream of waste materials (stream: W) containing organic impurity, water, and catalyst leaves the refiner. The mass flow rate ratio of organic impurity to water in the waste stream is (18:100.). Also, the high concentrated PLA stream (stream: P) that only consists of PLA and water, leaves the refiner. The daily production of high concentrated mixture (stream: P) in this lab is 107 g. How much waste does this lab produce per day (What is the total mass flow rate of stream W in g/day)?Hints: To receive full credit, you should show all the steps of problem solving:- A complete engineering diagram- List of all the assumptions- MBEs for all the materials and total - A complete DOF analysis and specifying of basis- Complete numerical calculations- Final answer in correct sig figs and units.

Building on the previous question, Operation Warp Speed  continues to move the vaccine in 45 lb boxes that each carry about 4,000 doses, but is exploring options with other carriers than Fedex.  A freight forwarder -- a company that purchases space in large blocks on flights from airlines and other carriers and sells that space in smaller blocks to smaller shippers -- offers the following pricing structure: $600 for any shipment weighing between 0 and 200 lbs $1000 for any shipment weighing between 200 lbs and 400 lbs. General Perna's team still wants to trade off the costs of getting the vaccine to states and counties in the Western US against the delays inherent in larger shipments. A larger shipment represents more Days of Supply, which means the vaccine waits longer to become a vaccination.  Demand for vaccines in Los Angeles County is estimated at 1.6 million doses (for the A+ portion of the population), which is about 11% of the total demand that will ship out of the facility supplying vaccine for the Western US.  The cost of a dose of vaccine is roughly $40. After long deliberations and an extensive scientific study considering perishability, risk of lives lost due to delays, etc., General Perna's team concluded an appropriate inventory holding cost for COVID vaccine is 50% for the period in question.  Using these values, what is the ideal shipment size, measured in boxes, for sending vaccine to Los Angeles County that minimizes the 'total cost' for Operation Warp Speed using the freight forwarder?

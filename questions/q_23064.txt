The price of a hot dog is $1.25 more than the price of a bag of potato chips. The cost of a soft drink is $3.50 less than the price of two hot dogs. (a) Write a system of equations that models this application, where x is the price of a hot dog, y is the price of a bag of potato chips, and z is the price of a soft drink. (b) Find the price of each item by solving the system of equations produced in step a.

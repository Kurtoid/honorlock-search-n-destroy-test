Make sure you are detailed and define all relevant terms and explain their role in the process.   An action potential is a signal that causes a cell to increase its intracellular calcium. In this essay, explain where this intracellular calcium comes from and how it gets into a smooth muscle cell and then follow the domino effect of this influx through the power stroke. Hint: be detailed about the activity of the thick and thin filaments and the process of phosphorylation. BE DETAILED! -- Explain where calcium comes and the activation of any channels that control it. from and what it does within the cell. --Explain the process that uses calcium and ATP for the sliding filament theory. Be detailed about the activity of the thick and thin filaments and the process of phosphorylation. (Note: You should assume that the action potential has already arrived at the cell and the peak voltage is currently traveling down the membrane...this essay is only about the effects of calcium in the cell.  Do not discuss the voltage change and channel functioning that controls an action potential down the cell.)   Note: BONUS will be awarded if you can add a paragraph that discusses and explains at least 4 of the ANATOMICAL differences between smooth and skeletal muscle (differences within the cells). You should be detailed link/explain how each anatomical differences affects differences in functioning (physiology) regarding HOW they contract.

The last question on the actual exam will tell you to retrieve your cell phone, and scan and upload your test as a single pdf to a separate assignment in Canvas. (Canvas, Assignments, Exam # Upload).  You must do the scan and upload while the Honorlock session is still running (meaning, the end of the Honorlock recording session will show you scanning and uploading your test.) You may not end the Honorlock session, and then scan and upload your test later.  The end time of your Honorlock session and the upload time of your exam must coincide.    The easiest way to do this is to use your phone to both scan and then upload directly to Canvas using the Canvas Student App (versus emailing the pdf to yourself and using the Canvas Browser to upload your test, because Honorlock will not allow you to access another webpage while running).  You must check your uploaded pdf file in CANVAS, Submissions (not just in your scanner app!), to make sure your pages are all there and legible.  Late or missed pages will NOT be accepted. After you complete the scan and upload, then you will click 'Submit Quiz' in Honorlock.  That will end the test and the Honorlock session.

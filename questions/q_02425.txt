Chick Fil A conducts research on their customers' experience in an effort to enhance it when stores reopen fully post-Covid 19. They identify 3 areas to assess: - In store employee helpfulness - Store cleanliness - In-store overhead music selection The firm conducts consumer research among 300 customers and explores two areas: Importance and Satisfaction and gets the following average ratings on a 10 point scale: In store employee helpfulness: Importance 8.7, Satisfaction 8.7 Store Cleanliness: Importance 9.2, Satisfaction 6.3 In-store music selection: Importance 6.5, Satisfaction 2.3 Based on this research and knowing you can only focus on one improvement initiative to start, which would would you choose. Please be specific in how you came to your decision.  Please format your answer as follows: Chosen Area for Improvement: Rationale:

A 69-year-old male patient is referred to you for evaluation and treatment of back pain. He reports a 3-week h/o mid-low back pain (lower thoracic & upper lumbar area) bilaterally that may have been caused by increased weight training at his gym.   PMH/PSH: H1N, CABG x 3 2003, hypercholesterolemia Medications: metoprolol, Zocor(tm), one baby aspirin per day  Systems Review: RHR 92 bpm, regular; BP 118/78; RR 14; afebrile You ask the questions on the General Health and Cardiovascular checklists. He responds positively to the question concerning pulsating pain, stating the back pain feels this way. You suspect a possible problem with systemic disease, so you decide to perform some clinical exam tests. Based on your hypothesis, the test that is least likely that you would perform is:

This same study from the last question is for this question: Canadian and Swiss researchers wanted to know if the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was important to the productivity of grasslands (M.G.A. van der Heijden, J. N. Klironomos, M. Ursic, P. Moutoglis, R. Streitwolf-Engel, T. Boler, A. Wiemken, and I. R. Sanders. 1998. Mycorrhizal fungal diversity determines plant biodiversity, ecosystem variability, and productivity. Nature 396:69-72). Specifically, they wanted to know if it mattered which specific AMF species were present, or just that some type of AMF was present. They grew various plants in combination with one of four AMF species (A, B, C, and D), no AMF species (O), or all four AMF species together (A + B + C + D); and they measured plant growth under each set of conditions. All plant species were grown in each plot, so they always competed with each other, with the only difference being which AMF species were present. On the graphs below, the x-axis labels indicate the number and identity of AMF species (bar 0 = no fungi; bars A - D = individual AMF species; bar A + B + C + D = all AMF species together). The y-axis indicates the amount (grams) of plant biomass for the species shown in italics above each graph.  Examine the effect of AMF species on Sanguisorba officinalis. Which of the following conclusions can be correctly drawn from the data?

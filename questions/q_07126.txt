(2) This peaceful baboon "culture" is especially surprising since the male baboons in the troop now all arrived after the garbage-dump incident. (3) Is it possible that the current members of the troop are teaching newcomers how to behave? (4) Most baboon troops are ruled by dominant males, who have control over all the adult females, the less powerful adult males, and the immature baboons. (5) Dominant male baboons frequently lash out and attack other members of the troop just to demonstrate their own superior size and strength. (6) But a Kenyan troop of baboons transformed its "culture" after the dominant males all died from eating tainted meat at a garbage dump where they foraged for food. (7) Once the dominant males (who had prevented the other baboons from feeding at the dump) were gone, the females and less powerful males spent most of their time grooming each other and interacting affectionately. (8) Fights became rare.

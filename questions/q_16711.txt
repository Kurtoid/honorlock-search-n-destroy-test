Let A = {1,2,3,4} and B = {a,b,c}.  Give a relation from A to B that is not a function. Express your answer as a set of ordered pairs.
An insulated cool room is used to store tomatoes at 50degF (=10 degC ). Tomatoes are harvested from the filed and brought to the cool room in bins containing 120 lb. of tomatoes. The temperature of tomatoes is 77 degF. Determine total heat load added to the room per day from the tomatoes including respiration and field heat removal loads.   The table of respiration rates is shown below:     To convert respiration rate of fruits and vegetables expressed in mg CO2kg-1h-1 to heat production in btu, multiply by 220 to get btu per ton per day. Take the upper limit for your calculation.   The specific heat of tomatoes is 0.92 btu/lb-oF   Formula: Field heat removal = product weight * specific heat * temperature difference

Read the lab description and answer questions 1-7 Jack was tasked with determining which brand of pen is most likely to attract a termite. He selected 5 brands of black ink pen, Bic, Precision V5, Sharpie, Papermate, Pilot, plus a pencil. Jack knows from previous experience that the termites are attracted to ink from a black Bic pen and are not attracted to lead from a pencil. To complete the experiment Jack drew a 7 cm diameter circle with each pen and placed a termite 0.25 cm from each circle. He then gave the termite 60 seconds to find the circle and travel around the circle. Jack defined positive results as a termite finding the circle within 60 seconds and then following the circle at least half way around. A negative result would be a termite that was unable to find the circle within 60 seconds or a termite that found the circle but followed it for less than half the circle. Jack tested ten termites on each brand of pen for a total of sixty termites. The results of Jack's experiment are found in the table below. Table 1: Number of termites that found the black 7 cm diameter circle within 60 seconds and then followed the circle for at least half the total distance.    Brand of pen Bic Precision V5 Sharpie Papermate Pilot Pencil   # of termites 10 2 0 4 10 2      Based on Jack's data, which pen/s attract termites?

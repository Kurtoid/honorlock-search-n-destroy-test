Preoperative Diagnoses: Loop ileostomy, status post sigmoid resection and status post closure of colo-vesical fistula Postoperative Diagnoses: Same Procedure Performed: Closure of loop ileostomy Anesthesia: General Indications: The patient has a transverse loop colostomy done after sigmoid resection for diverticulitis with an abscess and colo-vesical fistula. The conditions have healed and the patient consented to the closure of the loop ileostomy to return the GI tract to its normal state. Description of Procedure: Under general anesthesia with the patient in supine position, the area was prepped and draped in the usual manner. An elliptical incision was made around the colostomy. This was carried through the subcutaneous tissue. The segment of the colon was excised and dissected free all the way down to the fascia. The ileum and colon were separated from the fascia and the peritoneum ant the adhesions were lysed under the peritoneal surface. After the loop was excised completely freed, a side-to-side anastomosis of the ileum and colon using the GIA 80 was done. Hemostasis was secured and the end was closed with TA 60. The closer was reinforced with 3-0 silk and the bowel was placed in the abdomen. The fascia was closed with continuous #1 PDS. The skin was packed open. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition.  Principal diagnosis: [dx1]Secondary diagnoses: [dx2]Principal procedure: [proc1]Assign MS-DRG: [msdrg1]

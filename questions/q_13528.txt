Use the ribbon worksheet (in the data file provided for the exam). A company manufactures ribbon for thermal transfer printing. Different types of printers use different sizes of ribbons. The company has forecasted demand for different ribbon sizes. The rolls from which ribbons are cut are 1,900 mm in length. Scrap is valued at $0.09 per millimeter. The company has five different cutting patterns, so each ribbon size can be cut from at least one pattern. Construct and solve an optimization model for finding the number of patterns to cut to meet demand while minimizing trim loss (defined as total scrap value). The amount of each pattern utilized should be a whole number. What is the total amount of each pattern utilized in the optimized solution? Pattern 1: [pattern1] Pattern 2: [pattern2] Pattern 3:[pattern3] Pattern 4:[pattern4] Pattern 5:[pattern5]

You are studying a large population of stinkbugs in which a single gene with two alleles controls antenna length. Individuals that are homozygous AA have long antennae, those with aa genotype have short antennae, and heterozygotes have intermediate antennae. You sample the population and find that the frequency of the a allele is 0.80. A. What is the frequency of the A allele in the population? [v1] B. If the stinkbugs in this population are allowed to mate randomly, what is the expected frequency of the short antennae genotype in the next generation, assuming there are no evolutionary forces acting on the population? [v2] C. You return to the population 5 years later. A farmer has sprayed insecticide (poison) and killed all but 200 of the stinkbugs. What is the total size of the gene pool of this new generation of stinkbugs? [v3] D. You perform genetic tests and olfactory (smelling ability) tests on the remaining stinkbugs. You find that the frequency of the A allele increased, because bugs with longer antenna had higher survival than bugs with short antennae because they have a better ability to smell and avoid insecticide (you found this in your tests). Based on this information, the increase of the frequency of the A allele is most likely due to [v4]

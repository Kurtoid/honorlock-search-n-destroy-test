A 22-year-old medical student wakes up on the day of her Hematology exam with symptoms of sore throat, chills and fatigue. After three hours in the student health waiting room, a pre-health volunteer checked her in and did a thorough physical examination for 60 minutes including neurologic exam, auscultation for every possible heart murmur, knee exam of the four main ligaments, and goiter. The attending walks in after this hour of examination, somewhat accidentally, and asks the volunteer about the medical student's vital signs and throat exam. The volunteer forgot to exam those. The attending wrote an order for temperature testing and instructed the volunteer to look in the medical student's throat and exam her neck. One hour later, the attending comes back in the room to find out that the medical student had a fever (40.1degC), an erythematous pharynx with small pustules on her tonsils, and soft small lymph nodes in her neck. Her lung sounds were normal and her respiratory rate was normal. A rapid Strep test was performed, but the volunteer dropped the swab and because of budget cuts, no more kits were available. The volunteer wanted to learn how to draw blood. So the attending ordered a CBC. After 30 minutes of the volunteer poking a needle into both the right and left flexor carpi radialis muscles, enough venous blood was withdrawn from the antecubital fossa to fill one-tenth of a purple top EDTA tube. The CBC analysis was performed in less than 2 minutes, and showed:         Patient Result   Reference Interval     Hgb (female)   14.4 g/dl   12.0-15.5 g/dL     Hct (female)   43.2%   34.9-44.5%     MCV   90 fL   80-100 fL     WBC        11.8 K/uL   3.5-10.5 K/uL     Platelet count      252,000 /uL   150,000-400,000/uL     Granulocytes   68%   40-80%     Bands   8%   0-5%     Lymphocytes   20%   20-40%     Monocytes   4%   2-10%     What would you recommend to this medical student?

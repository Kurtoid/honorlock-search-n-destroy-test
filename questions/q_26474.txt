Adjoa, a Ghanaian citizen with a master's degree in library science from the University of Ghana, applies for the post of a reference librarian at North Texas State University. She is a permanent resident of the United States with authorization to work there and has eight years of experience as a chief librarian at a reputed university in South Africa. Mary, an American citizen with a college degree in English and two years of experience as a library assistant, also applies for the same job. Although Adjoa seems more qualified for the job, the selecting officer hires Mary based on a belief that Mary will be a more stable employee because she is an American citizen. Which of the following holds true in this case?

Skill B2.  (This question based on a decision described by John Gerdes.)  John is selecting a servo for a flapping wing UAV and is concerned with three attributes (torque, speed, and mass).  Attribute values for the servo alternatives (Gerdes, 2018).

If swing weighting will be used to determine the weights on these attributes, which of the following hypothetical alternatives are in the set of those that should be evaluated to determine the weights of the utility function?

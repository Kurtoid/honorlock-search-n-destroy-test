An attorney was asked to represent several home owners in bringing a suit for damages against a nearby manufacturer.  The attorney agreed to represent the homeowners on condition that they agree that if the manufacturer offers a lump sum payment in return for settlement of all claims, he settlement may be accepted if two-thirds of the homeowners vote in favor of accepting the settlement.  All homeowners agree and sign the attorney's fee agreement memorializing their agreement.   As expected, the manufacturer eventually offered a lump sum settlement and over two-thirds of the homeowners voted to accept the settlement.  One homeowner was unhappy with the settlement and refused to accept the settlement, but lawyer reminded the homeowner that they agreed to be bound by a two-thirds vote.  The attorney accepted the settlement offer.                 Is the attorney subject to discipline?

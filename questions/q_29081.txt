Below is the titration curve for the dipeptide Ser-Gly. Answer the following questions from the graph:  Blank #1: What is the isoelectric point of Ser-Gly? Blank #2: At what pH does the -1 ion exist in approximately 100% abundance? Blank #3: Using the shorthand notation (H3A+, etc), which ionic form(s) will migrate towards the (+) end of a pH gradient gel (isoelectric focusing) when a voltage difference is applied? List all the species, with appropriate charges, separated by commas. Do not worry about superscripts or subscripts.  Blank #4: In what pH range(s) would Ser-Gly be a good buffer? Here is an example of how you should list the ranges: 0 to 1, 2 to 5, etc.  Use the numbers on the titration curve to answer the following questions: Blank #5: Which number on the graph corresponds to the pH where ionic forms with charges 0 and -1 coexist? Blank #6: Identify the point (number on the graph) at which the pH equals the pKa of the Ser side chain. (Note: typical a-COOH and a-NH2 pH values in a dipeptide are 3 and 8).
Find an equation of the tangent line to the graph of at the point (1,0).
To form a 10-bit string (0s or 1s), the probability that a "1" is assigned to a bit is 0.75 (which means the probability that a "0" is assigned is 0.25). Knowing this, what is the probability that a 10-bit string will contain [x] 1's? Round your final answer to 4 decimal places.  (Place your answer in the blank, show work on your work pages.)

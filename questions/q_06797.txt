The iron(II) ion, Fe2+, can combine with the cyanide ion, CN-, to form the complex [Fe(CN)6]4- which has Kf = 4.21x1045. Suppose the average human body contains 6.00 L of blood with a Fe2+ concentration of [c]x10-5 M . If a person ingests some cyanide bringing the concentration of cyanide in their blood to [cn]x10-5 M, what percentage of iron(II) in the blood would be sequestered by the cyanide ion? Enter your answer numerically to at least three significant figures.

_____theorists are most likely to emphasize that cultural norms and beliefs integrate people into groups and create social bonds.
In each row, you are given the shape of a population distribution and the size of a sample collected from said population. To the right, select the appropriate answer for the shape of the sampling distribution, according to the Central Limit Theorem.    Population has unknown distribution, n = 20. [a]   Population is approximately normally distributed and n = 24.  [b]   Population is left-skewed and n = 100.  [c]

The hypothesis that men in high stress jobs have an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease was tested during an 18-year follow-up study from 2000-2017 of a group of 8,000 men of Japanese ancestry in Hawaii.  Of the 4,500 men with higher stress jobs, 3,000 of them developed CHD; of the 3,500 men with lower stress jobs, 1,800 of them developed CHD. All 8,000 men completed the CHD examination at the end of study, 3,200 were free of prevalent coronary heart disease (CHD), while 4,800 had incident CHD (there was no loss to follow up).           Disease             Have CHD   No CHD         Exposed ( high stress jobs)   3000   1500   4500     Not exposed (low stress jobs)   1800   1700   3500     Calculate the cumulative incidence of CHD for those exposed to higher stress jobs:

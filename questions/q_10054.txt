5 paragraph essay (20 pts) Using information from this course answer one of the following essays" 1. Imagine that you are a senior in college and get a summer job working on an endangered species of fish (Bull Trout, population approximately 45). You are soon promoted to co-principle investigator; in other words you will be heading up a research crew and are in charge of night sampling for an endangered species. At 2 am you catch a dead Bull Trout that has been washed out of a dam (your nets sample about 10% of the river), during increased water release for irrigation. If you report this dead fish, irrigation will be stopped and approximately 2000 people will lose water to their crops. What do you do? Now analyze this decision (effects on all species) from a population ecologist's point of view, and an evolutionary biologist's point of view. 2.

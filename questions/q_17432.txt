Americans have missed feelings about government.  We complain about highway and bridge tolls, but we insist that every road be in good repair and wide enough to get us quickly to wherever we are going.  Our consumption of tobacco and alcohol is among the highest in the world, yet we insist on strict regulations on who can buy them and where they can be sold and consumed.  We complain without fail about our taxes; at the same time, however, we demand that government spend more on everything from cleaner air and higher-quality schools to safer streets and more jobs.  We dislike "welfare" programs and those who use them.  Still, we want government to provide all Americans with an economic "safety net" to protect them during hard times. _________25.

Skill C2.  Consider the following material selection decision.  Maria is considering three different metals (aquinum, benedictum, and columbium) for the engine block of a new cryptoencabulator.  Maria wants to minimize the total expected cost over five years.  If she selects aquinum, the cost will be $150,000.  If she selects benedictum, the cost will be $250,000.  If she selects columbium, the cost depends upon the cost of divinum, which is used to crystallize columbium, as follows: if the divinum cost remains low, the columbium cost will be $200,000; the probability that this will happen is 0.20. If the divinum cost increases moderately, the columbium cost will be $300,000; the probability that this will happen is 0.50. If the divinum cost increases greatly, the columbium cost will be $400,000; the probability that this will happen is 0.30. There is only one benedictum supplier; if benedictum is selected as the material, it may happen that the benedictum supplier is unable to meet the supply contract obligations over the five-year period; if that happens, engine block production will fall behind schedule, which will increase the benedictum cost by $150,000 in penalties.  The probability that this will happen is 0.10. Because aquinum is a novel material invented by Maria's research assistant, she is unsure whether it will yield reliable engine blocks.  If aquinum causes engine block failures, then the firm will have to make new engine blocks from benedictum or columbium; in addition to the benedictum or columbium materials costs given above, the extra costs of making new blocks and safely disintegrating the unusable aquinum blocks will be $350,000.  The probability that aquinum will cause engine block failures is 0.05.  (That is, if she selects aquinum and it fails, the total cost includes the original $150,000, the extra $350,000, and the uncertain benedictum or columbium costs.) Which of the following decision trees best corresponds to Maria's material selection decision? A.   B.   C.

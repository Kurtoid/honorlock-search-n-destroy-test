Operation Warp Speed relies on Fedex and UPS to distribute COVID-19 vaccines across the US. Fedex handles shipments to the Western US and UPS manages those to the East. Fedex moves the vaccine in 45 lb boxes that each carry about 4,000 doses. The company charges $300 per box to move vaccines to the West Coast.  Fedex moves the vaccines to Los Angeles via airfreight in ULD's (Unit Load Devices). Each ULD can hold up to 64 boxes.   General Perna's team wants to trade off the costs of getting the vaccine to states and counties in the Western US against the delays inherent in larger shipments. A larger shipment represents more Days of Supply, which means the vaccine waits longer to become a vaccination.  Demand for vaccines in Los Angeles County is estimated at 1.6 million doses (for the A+ portion of the population), which is about 11% of the total demand Fedex will serve in the Western US.   The cost of a dose of vaccine is roughly $20. After long deliberations and an extensive scientific study considering perishability, risk of lives lost due to delays, etc., General Perna's team concluded an appropriate inventory holding cost for COVID vaccine is 45%.  Using these values, what is the ideal shipment size, measured in boxes, for sending vaccine to Los Angeles County that minimizes the 'total cost' for Operation Warp Speed?

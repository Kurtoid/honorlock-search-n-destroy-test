Read system requirements and answer the following question:   Mr. Wilks, a library member, should be able to search books by their title, author, subject category as well by the publication date.   Each book will have a unique identification number and other details including a rack number which will help to physically locate the book.   There could be more than one copy of a book, and library members should be able to check-out and reserve any copy. We will call each copy of a book, a book item.   The system should be able to retrieve information like who took a particular book or what are the books checked-out by a specific library member.   There should be a maximum limit (5) on how many books a member can check-out.   There should be a maximum limit (10) on how many days a member can keep a book.   The system should be able to collect fines for books returned after the due date.   Members should be able to reserve books that are not currently available.   The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reserved books become available, as well as when the book is not returned within the due date.   Each book and member card will have a unique barcode. The system will be able to read barcodes from books and members' library cards.   Question Identify three main actors in the system and type your answers below. Use lower case letters only. [actor1] can search the catalog, as well as check-out, reserve, renew, and return a book.

Accounting Formulas: Gain/Loss on Equipment (Sale) = Market Value - Book Value (a positive is a gain, a negative is a loss). A gain is a positive cash flow. Note that the book value of piece of equipment is equal to its original capitalized cost less its accumulated depreciation. Finance Formulas: WACC = (Cost of Debt * (1 -t)) * (Total Debt/(Total Debt + Total Equity)) PLUS  (Cost of Equity* (Total Equity/(Total Debt + Total Equity))) Cost of Debt = Risk Free Rate + Default Risk Premium  Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Beta * Market Risk Premium) Market Value Added (MVA): Formula not provided. You need to know this one. Stock Valuation Models:              Zero Growth Rate for Dividends into Perpetuity: Price = Div0/r            Constant Growth Rate for Dividends into Perpetuity: Price = Div1/(r-g).   OR. Price = (Div0 * (1+g))/(r-g) Cash Flow Models:             Annual Firm Level Free Cash Flow: FCF = (EBIT * (1-t)) - Capex - Change in WC + Depreciation                OR FCF = (EBITDA - Depreciation expense) * (1-t) + Depreciation - Capex - Change in WC                                                      Firm Terminal Value at year N: = (EBIT (n) * (1+g) * (1-t))/(r-g)                         (note similarity to constant growth dividend model) Net Present Value/Future Value/IRR/Payment Annuities: Use Excel macros Payback Period/ Discount Payback Period: No formulas -- use methods shown in class.

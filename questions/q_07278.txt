A uranium nuclear fission reaction is produced when a neutron hits a nucleus.  Let's call that step 0. The nucleus splits in two smaller nuclei, energy and [n] neutrons that we will refer to as step 1. Each of  those neutrons will in turn produce another fission in a process called a chain reaction.  No formula is needed. Just a proper count of how many neutrons are produced at each stage. How many neutrons will be produced  in step  [g]?  Your answer should be an integer value with no units.

A group of students has been trained to increase their score on the math segment of the S.A.T.  For the general population, S.A.T.-Math scores are distributed N (505,105). It is reasonable to assume that the shape of the distribution is unchanged by training effects, but is shifted, hopefully to the right. It follows that we assume that s=105. For a random sample, of size n = 100 the sample mean S.A.T.-math score is 529.   Find n in order to estimate u with a margin of error M=5, and with 99% confidence (s =105). Remember to round up to the next highest whole number.

Suppose that a bank wishes to predict whether or not an existing holder of its Silver credit card will upgrade, for an annual fee, to its Platinum credit card. To do this, the bank carries out a pilot study that randomly selects 40 of its existing Silver card holders and offers each Silver card holder an upgrade to its Platinum card. Here, the response variable Upgrade equals 1 if the Silver card holder decided to upgrade and 0 otherwise. Moreover, the predictor variable Purchases is last year's purchases (in thousands of dollars) by the Silver card holder, and the predictor variable PlatProfile equals 1 if the Silver card holder conforms to the bank's Platinum profile and 0 otherwise. Below is the classification tree they derived from the data collected in the study.    Of these 40 Silver card holders, what is the proportion that did upgrade?

Many pathogens (including the SARS -coronavirus 2) can be detected through their DNA. A new method for the sensitive detection of DNA strands uses iron-based nanoparticles. Several single strand DNA chains are bound to an  iron-based Nanoparticle to form capture probe A.  DNA chains with a different sequence are bound to a similar set of  nanoparticles  (capture probe B). The addition of a (single strand) DNA strand of interest to a mixture of the capture probes will lead to the binding of probe A at one specific site of the DNA strand and of probe B at another specific site. Altogether, a network/cluster of connected nanoparticles is formed (see figure). This clustering of iron particles leads to a change in magnetic properties. In a simplified view: nanoparticle-clusters will act as nano-magnets while the capture probes do not. The change in magnetic properties can be detected using a variety of instruments such as an NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectrometer or SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device). Based on figure 1 it is obvious that a large variety of clusters can be formed, out of which only the larger clusters show the desired change in magnetic properties.  In a first approximation we decide to model the process through representative chemical reactions:   the DNA strand of interest - referred to as DNA1- reacts to form components, which do not change magnetic properties)  A + B + DNA1   ->   A - DNA1 - B                                                  (reaction i)   Reaction (ii) (accounting for the formation of components, which change magnetic properties)  A - DNA1 - B +  DNA1   -> A20 DNA125B20                                                          (reaction ii)   A biological sample solution under investigation contains not only the single strand DNA1 molecules but equal amounts of the complementing strand (DNA2). These strands can combine to a single molecule according to:               DNA1 + DNA2 -> DNA1-DNA2                                                       (reaction iii) We consider the following system: 100 microliter of blood-extract containing an unknown number of DNA1 strands of interest (and an equal number of strands DNA2) is entering a microreactor in stream F. A second input stream C contains 100 microliter of a solution containing 1012  nanoparticles of probe A and 1012 nanoparticles of probe B. The reactor has only one exit stream P, which is sent to the detector. It is known, that this exit stream does not contain any unreacted DNA1. On the other hand, the conversion of DNA2 is 10%.  At least 106 nanoparticles of the type A20DNA125B20 must be formed in order to lead to a detectable change of magnetic properties. It is also known that the extent of reaction for reaction (i) is larger by a factor of 20 than that of reaction (ii).   You want to determine the minimum amount of DNA1 in stream F, which can be detected via the formation of A20 DNA125B20. Provide a diagram of the system, state all relevant conditions, conduct a degree of freedom analysis and list all accounting equation and other relevant equation needed for your calculation (THE CALCULATION IS NOT REQUIRED, equations should be reported in an Algebraic form using a suitable nomenclature AND with known values "plugged in").

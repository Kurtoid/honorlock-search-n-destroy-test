There are three Urns labeled A, B, and C. Urn A contains 8 red and 5 yellow balls. Urn B contains 6 red and 11 yellow balls. Urn C contains 3 red and 8 yellow balls. Find the indicated probabilities for no replacement experiments:  1. If we randomly select four balls from Urn A, to get 2 red and two yellow (in any order)   2. If we randomly select five balls from Urn B, to get all red balls.   3. If we randomly select three balls from Urn C, to get at least one red ball.

Part B (1 point) This question builds on the answer to Question 2. Frank's Sausage is looking at a new sausage system with an installed cost of $480,000. This cost will be depreciated straight-line to zero over the project's 3-year life, at the end of which the sausage system can be scrapped for $70,000. The sausage system will save the firm $170,000 per year in pretax operating costs, and the system requires an initial investment in net working capital of $29,000. The net working capital associated with the project can be recovered at the end of the project. The tax rate is 34% and the discount rate is 10%. What is the operating cash flow associated with this project?   Round to zero decimal places.

Psicose is a stereoisomer of the sugar fructose and is used as a low-calorie sweetener. It is naturally present in small quantities in certain foods. One enantiomer of psicose, namely L-psicose, is shown below. L-psicose can exist in an open chain form (L-psicose) or it can cyclize to form a six-membered ring (a-L-psicopyranose). Answer the questions below about L-psicose and a-L-psicopyranose.  Which of the Fischer projections (A-F) below represent L-psicose? [Fischer]  Which of the chair conformations (T-Z) below represent the MOST stable conformation of a-L-psicopyranose? [Mchair] Which of the chair conformations (T-Z) below represent the LEAST stable conformation of a-L-psicopyranose? [Lchair]  How many total stereoisomers are possible for a-L-psicopyranose (including the one drawn)? [stereopyr] How many diastereomers are possible for L-psicose? [diaspsi] The anomeric center of a cyclic sugar is the newly formed chiral center resulting from the cyclization reaction. Which of the carbon atoms labeled 1-6 above is the anomeric center? [anomeric] Identify ONE chair conformation (T-Z) that represents the enantiomer of a-L-psicopyranose. [enantiomer] What is the relationship between the Fischer projections labeled C and F? [relationship]

More than six in ten (62%) college seniors who graduated from public and private nonprofit colleges in 2019 had student loan debt and they owed an average of $28,950, according to Student Debt and the Class of 2019, the 15th annual report on student debt at graduation released today by The Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS).  This is a lower share of students than the Class of 2018 (65%), and a very slight decline (less than 1%) in total debt from the 2018 average of $29,200. Looking at the data reported for Michigan, the average loan debt is $32000 with a standard deviation of $6400. From: the institute for college access & success.  Press release/statement 10/6/2020 Use the data about Michigan to complete the empirical rule, normal distribution chart.     In the blanks, fill in the values from left to right.  So in Blank 1 below you should have the value that goes on the line above m-3s{"version":"1.1","math":"m-3s"}, in Blank 2 the value for m-2s{"version":"1.1","math":"m-2s"} and so on.

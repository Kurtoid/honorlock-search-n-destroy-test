You're an inventive Java developer and you decided to build a program that will keep track of your startup company ideas.  Three properties that make up a startup idea are: (a) the problem that the idea is solving; (b) the number of people who experience the problem; (c) whether there are existing solutions to the problem.  To illustrate, let's consider Google.  When the company first started the following were true: (a) finding information on the web was quite hard; (b) 200 million people were on the web; (c) there were solutions, which were poor however. Write a class called StartupIdea that has three instance variables that represent the (a), (b), and (c) properties described above.  The types and names for these instance variables are: (a)    String : problem (b)    int : marketSize (c)     boolean : existingSolutions So, in Google's case the values represented by (a), (b), and (c) would be: (a) "finding information on the web is quite hard" (b) 200000000 (c)  true   In addition to these instance variables, StartupIdea should also include: 1)      a constructor that accepts values for each of these variables and uses shadowing to assign them.  2)      a variable called totalIdeas that keeps track of the number of total StartupIdeas created during a program's run.  Use the most restrictive visibility for this variable and the three instance variables listed above. 3)      a public setter and getter method for marketSize 4)      a toString method that prints out the values of each instance variable in a clearly labeled way. 5)      a parameterless instance method called scrap with two statements.  The first prints out a line of text that contains "Scrapping: " followed by the problem value. The second decrements the value of totalIdeas.   6) a main method that creates a single StartupIdea object with the following values for problem, marketSize, and existingSolutions: "finding hand-sanitizer is nearly impossible", 300000000, and true. 7) The main method then invokes the scrap method on the above object after it's created.  The expect output for that would be: Scrapping: finding hand-sanitizer is nearly impossible

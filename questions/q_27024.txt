A physical therapist is treating a patient who was diagnosed with ALS 6 months ago.  During conversation the patient demonstrates nasal tone in their voice and the patient reports having difficulty eating secondary to choking.  His nutritional status has suffered and he is losing weight.  The patient also demonstrates right lower extremity weakness.  His manual muscle test indicated the following:   hip 3+/5, knee 3+/5 and ankle 2+/5.  Patient reports tripping often and increased fatigue with walking within the community. As related to the tripping episodes, what would be the most appropriate treatment strategy?
People with a very high score on the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) have a lower probability of developing a major illness.
FULL SOLUTION PROBLEM:  Answer the question here (enter the answers in the text box), but you must submit a full solution including Given, Find, EQU, all mathematical steps, and include units.  Work on this problem should be submitted to the Test #2 work submission link on Canvas Text #2 Module no more than 15 minutes after the completion of this Quiz. A block and sphere are connected by a cord that passes over a pulley as shown in the figure below. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the incline is 0.23 and assume the cord is massless. Take m1 = 1.00 kg, m2 = 5.25 kg, and th = 35.6deg. Answer the following questions.     Include free body diagrams for the block and sphere in your solution. What is the magnitude of the acceleration (in m/s2) of the block as it falls along the incline? [2 pts.] What is the tension (in N) in the cord? [1.5 pts.] What is the speed (in m/s) of each object when the block reaches the bottom of the incline if they released from rest at the position shown in the figure? [1.5 pts.]

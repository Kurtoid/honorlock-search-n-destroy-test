Several communities lie around the recently purchased land and will be affected by how you manage that land. Although the land was private property, community members have a long history of visiting the area for a variety of reasons (i.e., fishing, boating, beach activities, and picnicking). Your supervisors are expecting you to develop a coastal restoration plan that allows for some sort of public access with as minimal conflict as possible.

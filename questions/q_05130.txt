(2) (10 points) A beam cross-section is shown. The shear force V is vertical and downward for this cross-section (not shown). Draw this cross-section on your solution sheet (dimensions not necessary) and identify clearly the area A that you would use to compute the shear flow/stress at points (a) and (b). Calculate the value of Q that you would use to compute shear flow/stress at points (a) and (b). DO NOT CALCULATE TAU.

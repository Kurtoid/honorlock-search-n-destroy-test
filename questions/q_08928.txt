Below are an original text from an article by Marsha Sinetar that originally appeared on page 9 of the book Do What You Love: The Money Will Follow and a student's version of the same information. Why does the student's version constitute plagiarism? Original:   "Right Livelihood, in both its ancient and contemporary sense, embodies self-expression, commitment, mindfulness, and conscious choice. Finding and doing work of this sort is predicated on high self-esteem and self-trust, since only those who like themselves, who subjectively feel they are trustworthy and deserving, dare to choose on behalf of what is right and true for them."

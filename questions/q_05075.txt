Colleges have a serious problem with alcohol abuse among students, and its not getting any better. . . . Binge drinking--defined as the heavy, episodic use of alcohol--has persisted on campuses despite both a general decrease in alcohol consumption among Americans and an increase in the number of abstainers. Some people (including the author of a recent front-page article in The New York Times) have assumed that the latter two trends have translated into more moderate drinking on the campuses. Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Our recent research, which received support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was the only large-scale study to date of the extent and consequences of binge drinking at a representative sample of American colleges and universities. Our detailed findings from surveys of 17,592 students at 140 randomly selected four-year colleges were published in the December 7, 2014, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. . . . Our study found that 44 percent of all students in the sample were binge drinkers--50 percent of the men and 39 percent of the women. from "Too Many Colleges Are Still in Denial about Alcohol Abuse" by Henry Wechsler, Charles Deutsch, and George Dowdall, p. 943 In this excerpt, the authors help establish the credibility of their findings by providing

(Q001) The Texas legislature is a part-time, citizen legislature. It meets only once every two years for 140 days. Members of the Texas House are elected for two-year terms and are paid $7,200 per year. It is interesting to contrast the Texas legislature with a professional legislature, such as New York's. The New York legislature is considered professional because legislators are committed to being full-time representatives; they meet year-round, and members are paid $79,500 per year. Members of Congress also serve year-round. Former governor Rick Perry campaigned for president on adapting the Texas model to the U.S. Congress. Perry argued that the Founders intended a "citizen" Congress similar to the one in Texas, with members serving for only a few terms and retaining their regular employment in the private sector. As far back as 2007, Perry remarked, "When you have a full-time legislature, they just feel pretty inclined to be doing something. So they are going to dream up new laws, new regulations and new statutes--and generally all of those cost money." Perry's vision fits with the principle of limited government--the principle that Congress or a state legislature should have only a small role and the more legislators are in session, the more temptations they have to engage in corrupt practices and to pass laws restricting liberties.Opponents argue that the Texas model is not one that should be adopted for the U.S. Congress or other legislatures. First, they point out, meeting only once every two years reduces the time to deliberate and make sensible policies. In Texas, critics argue, the legislative session is rushed, and legislators rely too heavily on staff who work year-round and are more familiar with the ins and outs of policy making. The rush of completing the legislation necessary to govern the state also often leaves important issues unresolved, leading to the need for more special sessions. Members who are not independently wealthy are unable to legislate effectively because they cannot just leave their jobs for 140 days at a time--plus any special sessions--every two years. In addition, legislators are not any less prone to corruption under the Texas model. Under either model, lobbyists attempt to influence policy makers, and the fact that legislators have private-sector jobs does not minimize this possibility. Former Houston-area congressman Chris Bell warns that state legislators in part-time legislatures are actually more susceptible to corruption because "unless they're retired or independently wealthy, [legislators are] in a tough spot. There aren't a whole lot of jobs that lend themselves to a legislator's schedule, so those in office become prime targets [for lobbyists]." All of these factors result in a less productive legislature. Your vision of the proper role of government will likely affect where you come down on this issue. Liberals, who prefer an active government, would probably prefer a full-time legislature that actively addresses social problems. Conservatives, who are not supporters of government activity in the economy, are more likely to support a minimal role for legislators so that citizens are free to make their own choices without governmental interference. Why should citizens care about this issue? The political process matters, and how legislative institutions are designed makes a difference in terms of policy outcomes. Are you more convinced by the arguments for a part-time legislature or those for a full-time legislature? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?

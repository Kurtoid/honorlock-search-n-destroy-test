Which of the following forms of the HendersonHasselbalch equation is (are) correct?

Pew Research investigated the use of online dating sites by Americans in a recent research report.  The data indicates that even though more people are using dating sites, 53% of women in their sample still view online dating as a more dangerous way of meeting people when compared to other methods.   You decide to gather data from a random sample of women in Laramie and want to test the claim that the majority of women (in Laramie) believe online dating to be a more dangerous way of meeting people.  Out of the 260 women in Laramie you sampled, 143 believed online dating to be dangerous.  Provide a full hypothesis test and use a p-value to make your decision.

What process results in the hardening of an egg when it is exposed to heat?
In a neurophysiology lab, a collection of axons (a nerve fiber) is placed in a chamber and an electrical stimulator is used to drive their membranes to threshold.  Recording electrodes record the arrival of the action potentials at the end of the axons.  As the frequency of the firing of the electrical stimulator increased, the frequency of the action potentials generated also increased, to a point.  After that point, the frequency of action potentials generated remained constant, despite a continued increase in stimulator frequency.  (10 points) - Explain the specific mechanism causing the "plateau" in action potential frequency. (5 points) - Explain why the recordings of the action potentials yielded different velocities of action potentials along the nerve fiber.  Additionally, the recording of the arrival of action potentials

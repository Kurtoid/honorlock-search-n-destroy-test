Case study #6 Clostridium botulinum is the causative agent of botulism. This Gram-positive, anaerobic bacillus is commonly found on plants, in soil and water, and in the intestinal tract of some animals. The main virulence factor of C. botulinum is botulism toxin, which is a protein neurotoxin that causes muscle paralysis. Death results from paralysis of respiratory muscles. Genetic analysis has led to the understanding that C. botulinum has acquired its toxin genes from lysogenic bacteriophages. Adults who ingest C. botulinum spores alone generally do not become ill. However, adult botulism will result after ingestion of food containing botulinum toxin. Boiling and common chemical treatments used for water denatures botulism toxin. Infantile botulism, rather, results after children under the age of one ingest foods, such as honey, which contains C. botulinum spores but no botulinum toxin. Once inside the infant gut, these spores germinate and botulism toxin is produced after colonization. Treatment for botulism requires injections of botulinum antitoxin, pre-made antibodies that are administered to the patient as quickly as possible.   What environmental pressure keeps  botulinum spores that are in honey from germinating inside the honey bottle?
All exams in this course are closed book, closed note. Any notes or additional devices will be considered cheating. You will receive a zero for the exam and reported for academic dishonesty.  I have enabled a calculator if you need one for any of the questions. Additionally, DO NOT read the questions out loud and DO NOT take notes on the questions. Doing either of these things will also cause you to receive a zero for the exam and be reported for academic dishonesty. You must be fully clothed during your exam. Finally, if you do get a proctor pop-in, be respectful to your proctor. Blinn has a strict civility policy (see syllabus more information). This policy extends to all online interactions. Please indicate that you have read and understand these policies.
On the Excel spreadsheet "Final-Q8" tab, find the root of the following non-linear equation using the Bisection/Midpoint method in twenty (20) iterations. f(x) = -26 + 85x - 91x2 + 44x3 - 8x4 + x5 Employ the initial guesses of xL = 0 and xU = 5. The algorithm for Bisection Method:  Guess xL and xU Calculate f(xL) and f(xU) Check to see if f(xL)*f(xU)

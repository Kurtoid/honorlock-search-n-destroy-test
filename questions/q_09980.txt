An abrupt Si p-n junction (with a circular cross sectional area with diameter of 10 microns) is fabricated with Nd = 5 x 1015 cm-3 on one side and Na = 1018 cm-3 on the other side of the abrupt junction. If T=300K, calculate 1) the correct equilibrium contact potential, V0; 2) the equilibrium width of the depletion, or space charge, region, Wo ; 3) the depletion width on the n-type side of the abrupt junction, xn0 , 4) the depletion width on the p-type side of the abrupt junction ,xp0 ; and 5) the "uncovered charge" on the n-side (or p-side) of the abrupt junction, Q+. [Express your results in units of  V0 in volts; Wo ; xn0 and xp0  in nanometers; and Q+ in femto-C (10-15 C)]

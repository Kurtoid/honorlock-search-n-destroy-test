18. A medical researcher is studying whether drinking green tea lowers cholesterol. She considers two different methods: i. She could review the results of a study in which people recorded their daily food and beverage consumption and underwent a variety of medical tests including having their cholesterol tested.

She would take cholesterol readings before and after the two-week period. a. (3 pts) One of these is an observational study and one is an experiment. Which one is which, and why? b. (2 pts) Only one of these studies might allow her to determine whether green tea caused cholesterol changes. Which one, and why? (Note, both studies have flaws.) c.

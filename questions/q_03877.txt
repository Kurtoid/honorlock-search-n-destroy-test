Consider the problem of displaying a pattern of asterisks that form a triangle of height h, as shown below for h = 4: * ** *** **** *** ** * The problem can be solved with the recursive helper method shape below.  The method takes two parameters: low and high.  It first prints a row of asterisks corresponding to parameter low.  If high is higher than low, it recursively generates a shape in which low is incremented by one, and then prints another row of low asterisks.  Select a statement to complete method triangle, so that the helper method shape is invoked with the correct arguments in order to display a triangle with parameter height. public static void shape(int low, int high) {  if (high >= low)  {  asterisksRow(low);  if (high > low)  {  shape(low + 1, high);  asterisksRow(low);  }  } }  public static void asterisksRow(int n) // Method to display a row of n stars  {  for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j)  {  System.out.print("*");  }    System.out.println("*"); }   public static void triangle(int height) {  if (height > 1)  {  _______________________  } }

One of the keys of being able to put the puzzle of how motor control works together, is to understand the basic function of each component and the information flow between them. Fill in the blanks so the following statements will be correct.  The descending pathway from the motor cortex via the corticospinal tract activates ____[a]___ The descending pathway from the motor cortex via the corticobulbar tract informs the ____[b]____about the plan of the movement, so it can carry out movement error control based on sensory feedback. The _____[c]______ helps the motor cortex to activate appropriate motor programs based on the goal of the movement.  Neurons of the  _____[d] ____ do NOT make directly synaptic connections with local circuits within the spinal cord, and these are the only two motor control components for which this applies.

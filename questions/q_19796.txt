The table below presents long run macroeconomic data for 2 hypothetical nations A & B:     Economic Performance Indicators   A   B     Nominal GDP growth   15%   7%     Inflation   10%   2%     Nominal Interest rate   4%   4%     Unemployment rate   12%   5%     Population growth rate   1.5%   2.5%     Assume that both nations start with real GDP of $3,000 per citizen. Calculate and type the answers that would fill the blanks below, assuming that the data above apply for every year considered. Use the approximations formula: Economic growth = %D in nominal GDP - %D in price level - %D in population and the compounding formula P(1+r)n where P is the current amount, r is the rate (in decimal) and n is years, where applicable.  .

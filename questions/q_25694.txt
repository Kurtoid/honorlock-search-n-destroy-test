Consider a hypothetical branch-if-equal instruction that is 32 bits long: - 8 bits are used to encode the opcode - 6 bits are used to encode one register number - 6 bits are used to encode another register number - 12 bits are used to encode an offset that will be added to the program counter (PC) if the branch ends up being taken, and a new instruction address is required. The number is not in 2s complement form, and all 12 bits can encode a constant. Also note that unlike in the MIPS architecture, we do not left shift the offset by 2 here. Thus, the instruction syntax might be: BEQ R12, R11, X - If R12 == R11, the PC will be set to PC + X instead of PC + 4. Given this instruction, is the code shown below valid? Why or why not? Address Instruction 4000                       ... 4004                       BEQ R12, R11, X 4008                       ADD R1, R2, R3 ...                           ...

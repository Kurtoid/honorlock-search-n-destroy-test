Open the Exam 2-Forecasting Sales.xlsx   (Excel File). Follow these instructions to complete your exam. Historical quarterly sales data for the Coca-Cola Company are provided in the above referenced Excel workbook. All sales data are expressed in billions of dollars.  In the worksheet entitled "QTR Sales," create a line chart of the historical quarterly sales for the Coca-Cola Company. (5 points)  Ensure that the chart title correctly describes the data and that the horizontal axis shows the dates from September 2006 to December 2018.   Complete this question in the "QTR Sales" worksheet. Using the procedures detailed in class, decompose the time series into the trend, seasonality, and irregular components and then reconstruct the quarterly sales data with the three components. Assume that sales take on a multiplicative form in computing the irregular component and reconstructing the data. At a minimum, you should have columns for each of the following--in addition to the existing Date and Sales columns (20 points):  CMA (Centered Moving Average) Raw Seasonals Seasonal Index  You should also have a small table to the side to compute the Seasonal Index   Irregular Component Reconstruction   Fit the sales data using the Simple Exponential Smoothing model (SES).  Initialize the forecast for September 2006 by setting it equal to the historical sales for that date. Beginning in December 2006, use the following model to fit the data under SES (5 points):    Yt+1 = Yt + a(Yt - Yt)    Calculate the forecast errors using the MSE and MAPE. The equations for the MSE and MAPE are as follows (5 points):

Let's say you wanted to understand the role of habitat loss versus fragmentation on the Florida scrub lizard in central Florida. To do so, you acquire a categorical map of scrub patches in the central Florida region. With this map, you randomly select scrub patches to survey (using pitfall traps) for the presence or absence of scrub lizards before and after some urban development occurs that causes a reduction in scrub habitat. You will need to interpret how variation landscape structure may influence the presence or absence of scrub lizards in the patches that you sampled. Measures of habitat loss will include landscape [options] metrics.

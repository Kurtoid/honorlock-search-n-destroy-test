Which objective lens provides the least total magnification?
In this image, DAT stands for dopamine active transporter.  If the presynaptic neuron in this image were not producing enough dopamine, a drug might be given that targets the DAT protein.  Would this drug act to stimulate or inhibit the DAT protein?   inhibit The DAT protein recycles dopamine back into the preganglionic cell--removing it from the synaptic cleft.  If the presynaptic cell were not making enough, you would want any dopamine that WAS being made to be left in the synaptic cleft for longer...helping to ensure it was have a proper physiologic response.  Thus, inhibiting the DAT protein would slow down dopamine removal from the synaptic cleft.  SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), a common form of antidepressant medication, work in a similar manner.

Use this figure to answer the following question. Forest resource managers generally aim to maintain a resource population at the level where it ________.
2. A state fisheries manager releases trout into a lake. The population grows according to the model  where t is the number of months after the fish were released. a. (1 pt) How many fish are there at time t = 0? b. (1 pt) What is the continuous growth rate? c. (2 pts) How many fish will there be after 8 months? Round to the nearest whole number. d. (3 pts) When will the population reach 10,000 fish? Round to two places after the decimal. The model is f(t) = 500 * e^(0.15t)
Here is an argument for God:  If God did not exist, there would be no standards of right and wrong. There are standards of right and wrong. Therefore, God exists.  One way to refute the argument is to deny premise 1. That would mean saying that:
49.  Match the following anti-coagulant or anti-platelet drug  Unfractionated sodium heparin   to its laboratory diagnostic test listed below.   This test is used to determine if adequate levels are present following administration for a proper pharmacological response or if pharmacogenomics issues exist that leads to inadequate or excessive pharmacological response.  Critical thinkers should know this if you understand these drugs mechanisms of action.  3.1.2
A distribution of point charges is placed on the coordinate system shown below. The axis is marked in meters. Assume the potential infinitely far from the origin is zero.   a) Calculate the electric potential due to the distribution of charges at point P, which is located at the origin. b) Find the electric potential at r= 8mi+4mj (8m, 4m) labeled as P' in the figure. c) A charge qc = -1.965x10-3 C is placed at the origin and is moved infinitely far away. What is the change in potential energy for qc. d) First of all, qc is removed from the origin. Then a charge of qd=8.65x10-7 C is placed at P'. What is the change in potential energy in moving this charge to the origin? part a) V1 =-3.182 x107 V V2 =1.659x107 V V3 =5.529 x106 V VP =-9.699x106 V part b) V1' =-3 x107 V V2' =3.996x107 V V3' =2.492 x106 V VP' =1.245 x107V part c) part d) 13. The previous charge qc is removed from the grid. The new charge qd = 8.65x10-7 C is placed at point P'. How much electric potential energy is required to move the charge to the origin? Put your answer in standard notation, andround to 3 decimal places (no units).
Problem No. 4 A stepped shaft ABC consists of  solid circular segments  is subjected to torque T1 and T2 acting in opposite directions, as shown below, the larger segment of the shaft has diameter d1 =2.5-in and length L1 = 36-in and the smaller segment has diameter d2 = 2-in and length L2 =24-in. The material is steel with G =11,200-ksi, The toques are T1 = 30 kip-in and T2 = 10 kip-in. Given this information answer the following question: Question 4.4: What is the maximum shear stress in segment BC? [Enter value in ksi rounded to 2 decimal points]

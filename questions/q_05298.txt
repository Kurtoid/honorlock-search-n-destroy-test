The following information is used for the next two questions: Suppose you graduate from college today at age 23 (time t=0) and want to retire at age 60 (time t=37).  You expected earn an effective annual rate of 10% on your retirement savings.  You will make equal, end-of-the-year deposits to your account, with the goal to have $3,000,000 in your retirement account when you retire. ------------ Instead of listening to your parents' advice, you spend more money and save nothing for retirement for the first seven years out of college. After turning 30, reality hits and you decide you need to start saving towards your retirement goal.  You make your first deposit at the end of that year when you turn 31 (t=8)and continue making annual deposits until your last deposit at age 60 (t=37). Relative to the amount you needed to save per year if you started shaving right out of college (i.e., relative to your answer to the previous answer), about how much larger do your deposits now have to be given the 7-year delay?

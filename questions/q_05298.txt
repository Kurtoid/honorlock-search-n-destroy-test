Instructions: Below is a source followed by passage(s) from student papers. If the student has summarized, directly quoted, or indirectly quoted the source correctly, answer A. If you believe the source is incorrectly summarized or plagiarized, answer B for "incorrect."Original source:      "A generation ago, it was considered rude to eat in front of others. Now, Americans eat everywhere, all day longan average of five meals a day, counting snacks. Cars have cupholders, but they arguably need trays, too. Americans eat 30 meals a year in their vehicles."  Brink, Susan. "Eat This Now!" U.S. News & World Report, 28 Mar. 2005: 57.

She suggests that cars need trays as well as cupholders, but I think that's a bad idea. Eating while driving is really quite dangerous.

For the video game scenarios in the following questions, select which predictive steering/aim strategy is best suited for implementation. Strategies to Consider: Distance-based lookahead (DBL) - Approximate heuristic used to predict target's future position: based on current distance from target to agent, time for agent to travel that distance, and extrapolating target's position according to that calculated duration. Ballistic Projectile Intercept (BPI) - Kinematic equations that can be directly evaluated for position at a given time are used to completely or partially solve for valid intercept solutions via a system of equations. The algorithm may employ iterative refinement (e.g., a static target solver with iterative refinement to intercept a moving target). Simulated Projectile (SIM) - Directly solvable kinematic equations are not available and instead the projectile state at time step n is a function of the projectile state at time step n-1. In this case, candidate trajectories must be simulated and iteratively refined (and re-simulated) to find a solution.
Choose all of the following statements that are true for intermediate filaments:

Fleur finally approached a subject she had been avoiding. Her father had passed away while she was in Abidjan, and because of the COVID pandemic, she was not able to travel home to be with him in his last days. It was time to ask Grandma Rose some questions, but Grandma Rose started coughing. Fleur was alarmed whenever she heard a cough because of COVID, but Rose told her it was a cough she had for a long time before COVID was around, so Fleur continued. Fleur knew that her father, Grandma Rose's son, had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), but he had survived many years after his diagnosis. Which main substance would be elevated in the serum of patients with ZES? (one word answer)
On September 12, Vander Company sold merchandise in the amount of $5,800 to Jepson Company, with credit terms of 2/10, n/30. The cost of the items sold is $4,000. Vander uses the periodic inventory system and the gross method of accounting for sales. On September 14, Jepson returns some of the merchandise. The selling price of the merchandise is $500 and the cost of the merchandise returned is $350. Jepson pays the invoice on September 18, and takes the appropriate discount. The journal entry that Vander makes on September 18 is:

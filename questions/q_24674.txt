This question is about me, so Oklahoma law applies. In 2019, my class wrote a will for me. a. The will contained a specific devise of a painting, and I recently decided I didn't want to give the painting or anything else to that person, so I marked out that clause with a black permanent marker. When I die, if a student shows up with a photocopy showing what the clause said before I marked it out, will the painting go to that person, and why or why not?b. Regardless of your answer above, assume for this sub-part that the clause is revoked. Who gets the painting and why? (obviously you don't know the names of my heirs or the other people in my will, so just use generic terms)c. I decide to tear up the will because I want to revoke the whole thing. At that point, am I intestate or is the will I executed in my 2014 class (which is still in my desk) valid? Why?

(3+3+5=11 pts) Automobiles arrive at vehicle equipment inspection station "A" according to a Poisson process with an average arrival rate of 10 per hour. Suppose that with probability 0.5 an arriving vehicle will have no equipment violations. a.  What is the probability that exactly three vehicles with equipment violations arrive during a certain hour? b.  What is the probability that at least 10 minutes elapses before the next arrival of a car, regardless of whether it has an equipment violation or not? c.  There is a nearby vehicle equipment inspection station "B" and its automobile arrival rate is modelled as a Poisson process with an average rate of 15 per hour. Now counting the total number of arrivals to both stations, find the probability that there are at most three vehicles arriving in the next 6 minutes.

After a spacecraft is built, it needs to be fueled in order to actually be launched. One popular component of rocket fuels is hydrazine, N2H4, which can be synthesized from ammonia and sodium hypochlorite, shown below. A fuel production company needs to know the enthalpy of this reaction, and assigns you the job of experimentally measuring DHrxn.  2 NH3 (aq) + NaClO (aq) - N2H4 (aq) + NaCl (aq) + H2O (l) You combine 130.0 mL of 0.8[NH3] M ammonia and 110.0 mL of 0.6[NaClO] M sodium hypochlorite, both initially at 2[Ti] degC, in a perfectly-insulating constant pressure (coffee-cup) calorimeter. The temperature of this reaction peaks at a final temperature of 3[Tf] degC. What is the enthalpy of reaction, per mole of ammonia consumed? (The density of water is 0.998 g/mL.)

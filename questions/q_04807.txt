In a preimplantation genetic screening (PGS), which of the following techniques would most likely be used for detecting aneuploidies?
Fuel Efficiency (Canvas Q24~26, Handwritten Pages Q24) The fuel efficiency of a vehicle describes how far the vehicle is able to drive with a given amount of fuel. A car has measured its fuel efficiency on the freeway to be [eff] yards per cubic inch of gasoline (yd/in3); in other words, that is the number of yards a car can travel after consuming 1 cubic inch of gasoline. What is this car's fuel efficiency in units of meters per milliliter of gasoline?  (Additional 6 points) On your Handwritten Pages, show all of your work and box your final answer. ( Q24 ) Type in only the numerical portion of your answer, properly rounded to the correct number of sig figs, here. (Note: Canvas will not show trailing zeroes - you will not be marked down if your number here is missing a trailing zero.)

The Orphan Hermit received a "Tax Day" gift from Hermione, a copy of Dancing Naked in the Mind Field, a book written in 1998 by Kary Mullis, the developer of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR, central to sequencing DNA) and winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  Orphy was fascinated to read on the cover the description of Dr. Mullis as "the world's most eccentric Nobel-Prize winning scientist".  Orphy learned that the Thermus aquaticus, the thermophile bacterium that produced the Taq polymerase enzyme critical to PCR was first discovered in a small geothermally heated 70oC+ spring near the Great Fountain Geyser in Yellowstone National Park!  Orphy also read that scientists had thought that no life could exist at temperature above 70oC because enzymes and other proteins were denatured at these temperatures (that is, they lose their secondary, tertiary, and/or quaternary structure at these temperatures), although they don't lose their primary structure (that is, the amide or peptide bonds between the individual amino acids).  Orphy recalled from CHM 2051 the two amino acids cysteine and leucine (he drew the structures below, and then used R1 and R2 to symbolize the amino acid sidechains):  cysteine:   leucine:    Help Orphy predict the products of the chemical reaction between cysteine and leucine to form the dipeptide leucyl-cysteine:                   cysteine          +           leucine                   -              leucyl-cysteine  +   ?

A large study of the efficacy of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in preventing fractures in health postmenopausal women enrolled 35,000 female subjects.  Here is a breakdown of the subjects' ethnicities.

Challenging Consider two firms, Firm A and Firm B, negotiating a "financial merger" (i.e., a merger to diversify the risk of their cash inflows). Each firm's assets, before the merger, have market values of $40 million and those asset values have standard deviations of 50 percent. If the firms merge, their values will not change (i.e., they will have a combined value of $80 million), but the standard deviation of their combined asset value will fall to 30 percent. Each firm also has zero-coupon debt that matures in one year and has a face value of $16 million. Assuming that the risk-free rate is 0 percent and using the Black-Scholes model, how much will the bondholders of both firms gain at the expense of the shareholders (i.e., the so-called coinsurance effect) if Firms A and B merge? (Enter your answer to the nearest dollar. For example, for 42.5 million, enter 42,500,000. It should be a positive number)

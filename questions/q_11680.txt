The poet/writer in each literary period fulfills different roles in society.  In the Middle Ages, the scop recorded history and established the immortality of heroes.  During the Renaissance, the upper-class poets created ideals in beauty, love, and courtly behavior; the Restoration saw the poet become a political figure.  It was during the Romantic period that the poet wrote for himself, expressing personal emotion.  Many writers of the Victorian Era felt literature should expose the tensions caused by social conditions and the duality of human nature.  Towards the end of the Victorian era and the beginning of the 20th Century, the poet began to create "art for art's sake" and distanced himself from middle-class values, creating a unique world with fellow artists.  Which role do you think is most important for artists to fulfill?  In other words, what is the significance of literature?    Write an essay of 500-750 words explaining your thoughts.

The following questions refer to the diagram below. The solutions in the two arms of the U-tube are separated at the bottom of the tube by a selectively permeable membrane. At the beginning of the experiment the volumes in both arms are the same, and the level of the liquid is therefore at the same height. The membrane is permeable to water and to sodium and chloride ions, but not to glucose. The apparatus is allowed to stand for three days.      The sodium chloride solution on Side X will become more concentrated and then on Side Y less concentrated because a substance tends to diffuse from regions of lower concentration to regions of higher concentration of that substance.

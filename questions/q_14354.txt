The sum of all of the biochemical processes going on within the human body at any given time is called:
Recommended Time: 45 minutes Points:  30 Your client is Mountain Property Development (MPD), specifically, its CEO, Martin Barnett. His company owned a large parcel of industrial/commercial property from 1962 to 1982, when it sold the lot labeled "B" to buyers Sue and Joe Smith (the Smiths) (see map). Today, MPD owns lots A and C which are on opposite sides of lot B.  The shopping center on lot A extends from the east lot line all the way up to the west lot line.   North of the shopping center is a parking lot which fronts onto Bethalto Drive.  On lot C, are five four-family apartment buildings. The distance between the back of the shopping center and the property line of lot B is 25 feet.  Both of MPD's lots - A and E - were developed before lot B was sold to the Smiths.  Lot B is still undeveloped.   MPD has come to you because the Smiths are interfering with its use of two driveways on the Smiths' property:  one is the driveway which allows entry to the rear of the shopping center on lot A: this driveway allows for deliveries, trash removal, and utilities repair.  The other is the driveway which allowed entrance to the parking lot for the apartment complex on lot C; this driveway allows for access to the apartments building parking lot.    When the Smiths bought the lot B, they conducted a title search but found no recorded easements.  They admit, however, that they did see the driveways before they bought the lot.  Joe Smith says that after he bought the property, he had a survey done which revealed that the driveways were on his property and he notified MPD to stop using them.  MPD says it has a right to use the driveways because the driveways were visible to the Smiths when they bought the property, MPD has used them continuously before the time they sold lot B to the Smiths, and they are the only reasonably convenient way to get necessary access to the shopping center and the apartment complex.  There is a grocery store in the shopping center which gets deliveries from trucks and semitrailer trucks several times a day at the rear of the store, where there is a forklift and a concrete pad specifically built for that purpose.  The back of the store has wide, double steel doors which are large enough to accommodate large deliveries.  It would be difficult, if not impossible, for the semitrailer trucks to turn around in the small space at the back of the store.  Deliveries to the front of the store would be very difficult and disruptive, since large pallets of goods would have to be broken down and taken into the store piece by piece. The grocery store has been in operation, with the same delivery patterns, since 1967. The other driveway at issue leads into the parking area of the apartment complex on Lot C. The apartment complex was built in the 1960s and has been in continuous use ever since.  The parking lot is in the rear of the complex and holds 72 parking spaces.  If the area in front of the complex had to be used as a parking lot, it would hold only 30 cars, not enough to accommodate the apartment complex residents.           Martin is an engineer by training; he has been very successful in the property development business. He thinks the Smiths' position is outrageous.  He says it was obvious that MPD used the driveways when they bought the lots, and is angry that they want him to use much more inconvenient methods of ingress and egress.   Write a letter to Martin giving your assessment of his legal position,  his chances of success in court, and any other advice you may want to give.

What is the probability equation for T4?
In Java, objects within the same class share common _______.
Page 4--Respond to the following question on the bottom half of page 4 of your written work. The optical rotation of a sample of 1-phenylethanol produced in a substitution reaction was determined by dissolving 5.00 g of the product in 100.0 mL of ethanol.  The observed rotation of the solution in a 20.0 cm polarimeter cell was 0.880. (8 pts)  Calculate the specific rotation [a] of the product mixture. Calculate the percent enantiomeric excess of the product mixture. Pure (+)-1-phenylethanol has a specific rotation of [a]D = +44.00.    Calculate the percent of (-)-1-phenylethanol in the mixture (we are assuming the product mixture is only composed of the enantiomers of 1-phenylethanol).

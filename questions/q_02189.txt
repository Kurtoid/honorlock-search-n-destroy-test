A long bar of Silicon, with a 0.05 cm2 square cross section, is doped with 1015 donor atoms/cm3  at 300K.  A laser, with photon energies greater than Eg, shines on one end of the bar (x = 0) generating 3 x 1019 EHPs/cm3  per second at that position. The electron and hole lifetime are both 10-5 s. The electron mobility is 1300 cm2/ V-s and Dp = 12 cm2/s. What is the concentration of the majority and minority charge carriers at a distance of 100 microns along the bar?

Lab 5: Diffusion, Osmosis, and Cell Membranes You watched a virtual experiment on the dialysis process. There are two solutions (10% glucose and 10% starch) filled in equal parts in a piece of dialysis tubing. The filled tubing is then placed in a beaker and surrounded by deionized water (D.I.) and left to sit for 30 min.  After 30 min. the fluid in the beaker is separated, heated, and tested for the two solutions, and the same is done with the fluid remaining in the dialysis tubing.  Part 1: Which substance has diffused into the D.I. water in the beaker after 30 min.? (1pt) _______________________ Part 2: Which reagent did you use to test for presence of glucose?(1 pt) ____________________ Part 3: Which reagent did you use to test for the presence starch?(1 pt) ____________________

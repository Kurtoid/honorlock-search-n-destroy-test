You CANNOT use any software such as Excel, etc. Based on the excel below, complete the minimization problem (a new-factory selection problem) with a linear program in terms of the following notation.    Notation LA NY  Selection   Atlanta XAL XAN  Boston Dallas Houston   Tulsa XTL XTN  YB YD YH   Boston XBL XBN       Dallas XDL XDN       Houston XHL XHN        Excel     After solving this problem by using the solver, we obtain the values in the above excel sheet.   We build a new factory in Houston.  We send 600 units from Atlanta to NY, 800 units from Tulsa to LA, 100 units from Tulsa to NY, and 500 units from Houston to NY.   Note.

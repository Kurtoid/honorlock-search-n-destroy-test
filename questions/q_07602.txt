1a.      With illustrations, explain the role of carbon in hardening of steel by martensite formation.    1b.     Using the T-T-T shown below and ,                   (a) Determine the microstructure of a 0.77 wt % C-steel that has the following heat treatment:                                 (i) instantly quenched to 500degC from 727degC.                                 (ii) held for 4 s.                                 (iii) quenched instantly to room temperature.                           (b) What will happen if the steel is held for 1 day at 500degC and then cooled to room temperature?     1c.        What is case hardening?      2a.       Can we say that casting is the most versatile manufacturing process? Include the advantages and limitations of casting in your justification.  2 b.      Draw simple sketches and explain the role of Gate, raiser, runner, and sprue in the metal flow into the mold.  2c.       If a sphere ball casting with outer diameter 600 mm solidified in 150 seconds, find the constant of the Chvorinov equation. (Hint: For sphere Surface area = 4pr2     Volume = (4/3) pr3 )                2d.

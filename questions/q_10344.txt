This is the same fact pattern as that above - Question 1 part B. ER General Partnership, a medical supplies business, states in its partnership agreement that Erin and Ryan agree to split profits and losses according to a 40/60 ratio. Additionally, the partnership will provide Erin with a $15,000 guaranteed payment for services she provides to the partnership. ER Partnership reports the following revenues, expenses, gains, losses, and distributions for its current taxable year:    Gain on Sale of Equipment* $4,000   Depreciation** $14,500   Charitable Contribution $12,500   Sales $40,000   Investment Interest Income $500   Cost of Goods Sold $32,000   Tax-Exempt Income $2,000   Dividend Income $5,000   Business Interest Expense $1,000    *The equipment is a Section 1231 asset with accumulated tax depreciation at the time of sale of $3,000. **Depreciation includes Sec 179 expense of $7,000. Given these items, answer the following questions. B. Compute Erin's self-employment income, except assume ER Partnership is a limited partnership and Erin is a limited partner.

Addison's disease is partial or complete failure of adrenocortical function.
History is very much a written craft--most of what we know and study is what we read.  That makes narratives vitally important to any historian trying to understand and assess the past.  But this can range from private letters to public speeches, and be addressed implicitly or explicitly to every audience imaginable!  How to sort out what happened then--how to reconstruct what was (or what might have been)?  Well, we inquire, explore, ask, answer, and ask some more. In this exam, you'll do just that. For this exam, select one of three chapters in After the Fact: Serving Time in Virginia, Declaring Independence, or Jackson's Frontier, and use it to start an inquiry.  ATF is based on the very idea of how historians go about their work, and you'll take the lead handed you by ATF to dig deeper.  In your essay of 800-1000 words, tell me what chapter you've selected, very briefly what Davidson and Lytle argue in it, and then what questions you think they've raised but left unanswered.  If you had the job of revising ATF for the next addition by adding a follow-up to your chosen chapter, what would you ask?  How might you go about finding an answer? Where might the related sources in TSB lead us, for example?  The whole point is to prove to me that you did this reading, understood it, and now can mull it to become an active investigator/researcher/explorer yourself.  I expect to see both substance and creativity, evidence from ATF, TSB, and your own brain at work.

Write a function named repeat_letter that takes a string and a character as parameters and that returns a new string obtained by replacing every instance of the character with two copies of that character. For example, repeat_letter("banana", 'n') should return the string bannanna. Below are more sample calls:    Function Call Value Returned   repeat_letter("odegaard", 'a') "odegaaaard"   repeat_letter("BAZ", 's') "baz"   repeat_letter("misIsippi", 'i') "miisiisiippii"   repeat_letter("caRRy", 'c') "ccarry"   repeat_letter("JUGLE", 'u') "juugle"   repeat_letter("little", 'l') "llittlle"   repeat_letter("oOps", 'o') "oooops"   repeat_letter("fObAr", 'o') "foobar"   repeat_letter("applep", 'p') "apppplepp"   repeat_letter("rrr", 'r') "rrrrrr"   repeat_letter("theses", 'r') "theses"   repeat_letter("") ""    You should double both lowercase and uppercase versions of the passed in character and always output the result in lowercase. Notice that the function might be passed an empty string, in which case it should return an empty string. You may not alter the string passed to your function. It is fine if you allocate more space for your string than you end up needing as long as other functions can tell where your string data ends.

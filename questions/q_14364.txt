The steel T-beam has been strengthened by securely bolting two oak timbers to it as shown.  The modulus of elasticity of the wood is 12.5 GPa and that of the steel is 200 GPa.  If a bending moment of 50 kN[?]m is applied to the beam, the magnitude of the maximum stress in the wood is [sigmamax], and it occurs at [where] (pick one of A.-D.).  at the neutral axis at the top surface at the bottom surface at both top and bottom surfaces
Mention at least three characteristics of Gram negative bacteria. Hint: Do not include the color after Gram-stain.
You are the administrator of a network with a single subnet. A single Windows server (Srv1) on Subnet1 is the domain controller, DNS server, and DHCP server.   Due to recent expansion, you are adding a second subnet. The second subnet is connected to the first using a dedicated router. On Subnet2, you add a second Windows server (Srv2) that provides file and print services for hosts on that subnet.   You want hosts on Subnet2 to receive IP addressing information from the server on Subnet1. What should you do? (Select two. Each choice is a complete solution.)

For four of the impacts of climate change on human health you identified in the question above, explain how the human health issues are related to the climate change factors. For example, as the climate warms, the optimal temperature range of Aedes mosquitoes will expand (or shift). Therefore, humans who live in areas previously inhabitable for Aedes mosquitoes will now be at risk of contracting dengue.

Communication occurs through a specific SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAY, which is mediated by a set of chemicals. The first step in the process is your body identifying a non-self microbe. Your white blood cells have specific RECEPTORS on their surfaces that recognize every molecular shape that makes a microbe look different than one of your own cells, but are not activated by your own cells and molecules.

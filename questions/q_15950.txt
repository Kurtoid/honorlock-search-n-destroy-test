Bonus question:You are following a 70-year-old female patient who is very concerned because she noticed that her blood pressure is around 145/82 and when she was in her twenties she always had her blood pressure about 110/70. She doesn't have any other cardiovascular signs/symptoms and/or underlying conditions. How would you explain to this patient these changes in blood pressure at her age?

This is a three-part question about critical path calculation for datapath taught in the lecture. Consider a simple single-cycle implementation of MIPS ISA. The operation times for the major functional components for this machine are as follows: Below is a copy of the MIPS single-cycle datapath design. In this implementation the clock cycle is determined by the longest possible path in the machine. The critical paths for the different instruction types that need to be considered are: R-format, Load-word, and store-word. All instructions have the same instruction fetch and decode steps. The basic register transfer of the instructions is: Fetch/Decode: Instruction

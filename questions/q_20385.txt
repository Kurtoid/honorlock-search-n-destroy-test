While digging a shallow grave for the fake bones the prop crew had brought for the filming, they discovered a fossilized leg bone.  Orphy looked it over and suggested that it wasn't human, but was from one of the miniature three-toed horses that roamed the area long ago.  Kelly Kahl was intrigued and wanted to incorporate it into the show, but wanted to know how old the bone was.  Orphy suggested that they have it carbon dated at the UF geology laboratories.  The lab results showed that the 14C levels were 25% that of modern bones.  Given the half-life of 14C of 5730 years, how old would the bone be?    Turn in your work if you want partial credit!

Imagine you are in the lab:  1. Describe how you would prepare 100.0 mL of a 4.0 M NaCl solution from solid NaCl. Include the physical steps you would take as if you were in lab. 2. An emergency came up where you need to prepare a saline solution for delivering intravenously to a patient. The saline solution is 0.9% NaCl in water which is 0.154 M NaCl. You have the stock solution from PART 1 on hand. What volume should you add of a 4.0 M stock NaCl solution to obtain a 1.00-L of a 0.154 M NaCl solution? Report the final answer in milliliters. Give the steps for preparing this solution.

Ten(10) points total.  Discuss the following. In an Op-ed in The New York Times published December 30, 2011 entitled "The College Sports Cartel," Joe Nocera discussed the impact of the NCAA over college sports. He wrote: Twice a year in Vienna, the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gather to decide on the short-term direction of oil prices. Sometimes, O.P.E.C. agrees to cut back on oil production, pushing up the price of oil. Other times, it decides to boost production. Always, the goal is to fix the price of oil, rather than allow it to be set by the competitive marketplace. Indeed, collusion and price-fixing are the main reasons cartels exist -- and why they are illegal in America.  Yet, in Indianapolis a few weeks from now, a home-grown cartel will hold its annual meeting, where it, too, will be working to collude and fix prices. This cartel is the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The N.C.A.A. would have you believe that it is the great protector of amateur athletics, preventing college athletes from being tainted by the river of money pouring over college sports.  In fact, the N.C.A.A.'s real role is to oversee the collusion of university athletic departments, whose goal is to maximize revenue and suppress the wages of its captive labor force, a k a the players. Rarely, however, will the cartel nature of the N.C.A.A. be so nakedly on display as at this year's convention. If Mr. Nocera is correct and the NCAA acts as monopoly what would expect in terms of price, output and economic profit compared to a more competitive market structure.
The following are important steps in the process of endochondral ossification. What is the correct order for these events?  Enlarged chondrocytes die. Osteoblasts replace calcified cartilage with spongy bone. Chondrocytes enlarge and the surrounding matrix begins to calcify. Blood vessels grow around the edges of the cartilage. Perichondrial cells become osteoblasts and produce a superficial layer of bone.

Problem 3 (20 points). A company has a software for an asymmetric encryption scheme  that is known to be IND-CCA secure under some reasonable assumptions. But the message space for this scheme is only the set of messages up to 1MB long.  At some point they needed to encrypt messages of length more than 1MB but less than 2MB. So they decide to use the existing software in the following way. To encrypt a message , break it into equal parts  (for simplicity let's assume that all messages have even length) and let a ciphertext be computed as , for any . Here || denotes concatenation. The new decryption algorithm outputs , where  are two halves of the input ciphertext, if neither base decryption algorithm rejects. If either base decryption algorithm rejects, then the new decryption algorithm rejects. Let's call the modified scheme . The company hired a cryptography consultant to assess security, and she said that  is IND-CCA assuming  is IND-CCA and justified her statement with the following. "For any efficient IND-CCA adversary  attacking  we construct an efficient IND-CCA adversary  attacking : Adversary

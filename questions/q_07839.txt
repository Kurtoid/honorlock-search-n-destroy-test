Parallel Systems (Chapter 12) 7. (10 points, 5 mins) Consider three threads, part of the same process executing on a cache-coherent shared memory parallel machine.      Int Count = 3; // initialized to 3   You are implementing a rendezvous function.  Each thread will call the "rendezvous" function when they arrive at the rendezvous point.  Upon return from the function, the threads will continue with their respective execution.   The semantics of the rendezvous function is as follows:  Decrement Count atomically. If the Count > 0, then the calling thread is blocked until count goes to zero. If the Count is equal to 0, then set the Count back up to 3; release any blocked threads.    For example, in the execution shown in the figure above, T2 is the last thread to call rendezvous, after which T1 and T3 are unblocked to continue their execution. Write the code for the rendezvous synchronization primitive.  Your solution should not result in livelock or deadlock, and it should not use busy-waiting. You can use mutex lock and conditional variables for implementing the function. You may use any methods from the ptheads library in your solution. The exact syntax of the methods is not important.

Refer to the image below.  In the blank area below the image, type the muscle name for each letter indicated in the image:        A: muscle name B: muscle name C: muscle name   You MUST type "A, B, C... etc" before each individual answer to get full credit.  Give full muscle names to get full points.  For example, "biceps" will only get you partial credit; "biceps brachii" will get you full credit. Do your best with spelling.  Words spelled poorly will not receive full credit if instructor cannot identify the term based on how it is spelled.  Ignore the black lines that are not associated with a letter.  Each name is worth 1 point.

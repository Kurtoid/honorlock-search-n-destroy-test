Not every option will be used.  amino acid, AUG, Chargaff, conservative, Covid, Crick, exons, Franklin, helicase, introns, ligase, nucleotide, polymerase, protein, random, recombinant, semi-conservative, spike, transcription, translation, UAA, vector  Rosalind [a] determined that the structure of DNA is a double-helix. DNA replication is [b] which means each new DNA molecule is made up of one parent strand and one new daughter strand. [c] occurs when part of DNA is used as a template for RNA formation. [d] is the mRNA start codon. A DNA molecule that is made up of DNA from more than one organism is called a [e]. Every codon is associated with one [f]. Watson and [g] are given credit for determining DNA structure and modeling DNA. The enzyme [h] is responsible for unwinding the DNA helix before replication. One [i] is composed of a phosphate group, a sugar and a nitrogen-containing base. [j] occurs when RNA is used to direct the sequence of amino acids in a protein. [k] are kept in the mature mRNA strand. The mRNA vaccine that protects against COVID-19 codes for the [l] protein found on the surface of the virus.

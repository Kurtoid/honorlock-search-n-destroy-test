Frequency Distributions Snow Trillium (Trillium nivale), a Wisconsin threatened plant, is found in hardwood forests often adjacent to rivers or streams. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources would like to monitor the populations of Snow Trillium but first need to determine if the flowers are randomly and independently distributed in Southeastern Wisconsin. Staff with the DNR examine 349 randomly selected plots and tally the number of Snow Trilliums per plot. Some of the preliminary analyses are included below.  What is the appropriate theoretical distribution against which to compare the observed frequency of snow trilliums?

Rhagoletis pomonella is a parasitic fly native to North America that infests fruit trees. The female fly lays her eggs in the fruit. The larvae hatch and burrow through the developing fruit. The next year, the adult flies emerge. Prior to the European colonization of North America, the major host of Rhagoletis was a native species of hawthorn, Crataegus marshallii. The domestic apple tree, Malus domestica, is not native to North America, but was imported by European settlers in the late 1700s and early 1800s. When apple trees were first imported into North America, there was no evidence that Rhagoletis could use them as hosts. Apples set fruit earlier in the season and develop faster, where hawthorns set later and develop more slowly. Recent analysis of Rhagoletis populations has shown that two distinct populations of flies have evolved from the original ancestral population of flies that were parasitic on hawthorns. One population infests only apple trees, and the other infests only hawthorns. The life cycles of both fly populations are coordinated with those of their host trees. The flies of each population apparently can distinguish and select mates with similar host preferences and reject mates from the population specific to the other host tree. There is very little hybridization (only about 5 percent) between the two groups.         Matings between individuals from the two populations of Rhagoletis produce hybrid flies that appear to be healthy and have normal life spans. The eggs laid by these hybrid flies, however, hatch less often than those of flies from either of the two populations. What isolating mechanism seems to be important in this hybrid population?             A) Prezygotic isolation       B) Mechanical isolation       C) Reduced hybrid fertility       D) Habitat isolation

Wilhelm C. Roentgen's discovery of "the X-ray" is regarded as one of medicine's most significant achievements. Although his discovery was accidental, his early research was so thorough that no significant findings have been added to his original theories. This in itself is a true tribute to the brilliance of Roentgen as a scientist. One of the most famous early images he created was an X-ray image of his

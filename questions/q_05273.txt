Design Patterns: Prof. Gardner wants to write an application to plan the layout of the gardens. There are three types of gardens - annual gardens, vegetable gardens, and perennial gardens. No matter the type of garden, we want to ask the same questions:  What are good center plants? What are good border plants? What plants do well in the shade?  Suppose for simplicity, there is an abstract Plant class (or interface) that all specific plants will subclass (or inherit). Examples of specific plants are Pea, Broccoli, Corn, and Rose. There can be many others. Assume for simplicity that for a particular garden, only one plant is used in each zone (i.e. the center of a garden can only have one type of plant, etc). Suppose that the client is represented by the Gardener class. The client determines the type of garden to be used (annual, vegetable, and perennial). Once a particular type of garden is selected, there should be the ability to create plants that do well in the center, border, or shade for the specific type of garden. Use the abstract factory pattern to draw develop a solution for Prof. Gardner. Draw a UML class diagram of your solution. The hierarchy of plant classes (show some - your choice) and the garden factories should be clearly shown.

An experiment exposed mice to varying light conditions at night. The scatterplot of Body Mass Gain versus Percent of Calories showed evidence of a linear relationship.    The resulting least squares regression line equation  Body Mass Gain = 1.622 + 0.115 x Percent of Calories has an R2 value of 0.5866. What does the least squares regression line equation predict for the body mass gain (in grams)  for a mouse who eats 50% of its calories during the day? [a] (Round your answer to two decimal places.) What is the value of the correlation coefficient? [b] (Round your answer to two decimal places.)

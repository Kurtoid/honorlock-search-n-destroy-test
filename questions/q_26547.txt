10.  The following reaction has a value of Kc of 2.19 X 10-9 at 100.0oC.                                                                    COCl2(g)   =  CO(g)  +  Cl2(g)      a) At 100.0oC, the vessel contains 3.11 X 10-3 M COCl2, 7.10 X 10-6 M CO, and 2.56 X 10-4 M Cl2.  Is the system at equilibrium?  If not, in which direction will the reaction go to achieve equilibrium?  (3 pts)             b) At 100.0oC, a different vessel contains the same chemical species.

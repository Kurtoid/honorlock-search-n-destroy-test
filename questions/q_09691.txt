A cantilever column W14 bent about the strong axis is subjected to a vertical gravity dead load Pu = 100 kips and a horizontal wind load Hu = 5.0 kips as shown below. Pu and Hu are ultimate loads (LRFD). The column is braced out of plane and only allowed to deflect in-plane about the strong axis. The magnitude of the second-order deflection is more than 1.7 times the first-order deflection using the reduced stiffness of 0.8 times the nominal stiffness.    What is the magnitude of a notional load that would be additive to the applied lateral wind load shown?

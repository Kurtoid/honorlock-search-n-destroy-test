Lecture Read the text and respond to the following questions.   Est-il possible de mesurer le bonheur? Jusqu'a recemment, les economistes etaient d'accord pour affirmer que le bien-etre etait strictement lie a la richesse. Un consensus existait concernant le fait que l'argent suffise (is sufficient) a notre bonheur. Le progres se mesurait donc a notre degre de consommation de biens et de services comme le logement, les loisirs et la nourriture. Mais ces conceptions ont ete quelque peu bousculees (shaken up) quand une etude de l'Insee, intitulee <<Qualite de la vie>>, a enfin ete publiee. Ses resultats montraient que les Francais evaluaient leur sentiment de bien-etre a environ 6,8 sur une echelle (scale) de 0 a 10. Ils montraient aussi que le revenu n'etait plus le seul critere important dans cette evaluation, mais que la qualite de vie jouait autant voire peut-etre plus. Des elements comme la sante, le logement, les relations sociales ou le stress, qui influent sur la perception des individus quant a leurs conditions materielles et sociales, seraient donc capables d'expliquer le bien-etre mieux que les revenus seuls. Le Bhoutan, ce petit pays au nord de l'Inde, a depuis des annees deja remplace la mesure du PIB, produit interieur brut (gross domestic product), par celle du BNB, <<bonheur national brut>>. On peut se demander si, apres ces decouvertes, la France ne va pas vouloir l'imiter. Nous n'y sommes pas encore! Est-ce que l'auteur de l'article pense que la France va imiter l'initiative du Bhoutan?

Which case involved the following information?   Facts: Plaintiffs were the parents of a 6 year old child that suffered severe and permanent brain damage from being exposed to lead-based paint in their rental home. The defendant, who owned the home, had been aware for some time that there were issues with the lead in the home but never tried to remove the hazard.   Ruling in Case: The court ruled that defendant was required to pay money to the plaintiffs because (a) he was negligent in failing to keep the home free of lead paint and (b) he shouldn't have rented the home to the plaintiffs when the defendant knew lead paint was in the home and that it would could cause injuries.
Describe in detail four forecasting techniques and identify which one you feel is the most appropriate. Please elaborate on the specific reasons as to why you think your selected forecasting technique is better relative to the other three. Your answer needs to be based on theory (i.e., statistical and economic significance) that was discussed in the videos as well as referenced in the text book. Additionally, provide a few arguments as to why forecasting is important for any international company.
Question Part 3: Bonus question, worth 5 points added to your final score. There are two parts to this question; answer both parts to get full credit.  Copper is a very important element used in industry and in our daily use at home in electronics/communications/cookware and in our automobiles. But copper has a very low abundance in/on earth and thus we could run out if substitutes are not found.  1. The resource amount (total in earth) of copper is 6,000,000 million metric tons; assume that the economically viable reserve amount of copper using current extration methods is 600 million metric tons and the annual production amount is 20 million metric tons per year. Calculate, or set up the calcuation, the current copper depletion time (in years) under current extraction/mining methods.  2. Name two substitute materials we use in relatively large quantites that will extend your calculated deletion time for the reserve amount copper.

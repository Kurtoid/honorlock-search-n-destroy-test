Question 2  The pathology department at John's Hopkins provides support for many other teams at the hospital by analyzing medical sample slides and providing reports of the results.  The pathology residents working the first shift of the day have to decide how many of each type of slide to analyze during their shift, which impacts how many slides of each type are left for the second team of residents who work at night. For both shifts combined there are 20 slides with liver samples each requiring 30 minutes of processing time, 15 slides with muscle tissue each requiring 45 minutes of processing time, and 40 slides with skin tissue each requiring 20 minutes of processing time that have to be analyzed. Each type of slide has a priority score, this is 4 for liver sample slides, 1 for muscle tissue sample slides, and 2 for skin sample slides. The residents all have different skills and strengths, so at least 15 of the slides with liver samples and at least half of the skin samples have to be analyzed by the first shift residents.  At least two thirds of the muscle tissue slides have to be analyzed on the second shift.  The first shift residents can only analyze up to 45 slides during their shift.  All of the slides they analyze on first shift can only have a combined processing time of up to 25 hours. Formulate an LP to help the first shift residents decide how many of each type of slide to analyze today in order to maximize their total priority score.   How many variables will there be in the dual formulation of this problem?

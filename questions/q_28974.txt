Chapter 10 Scenario: Albert is writing the instructions for a new line of espresso machines his company is manufacturing. These machines range from an apartment model that makes one cup of espresso at a time to a free-standing commercial model intended for independent coffee shops and cafes.  The company is marketing a single-person apartment model, an in-home model, a small shop model, and a large-shop model that can make multiple cups of espresso quickly.  Albert looks over the various models and wonders who will be using which espresso machine and where.  He decides to jot down a set of questions to help him think about his audience fo reach machine.   After thinking about who will use the different models and questions he has asked about his readers (Who are the readers for each type of machine? What do those readers know about the espresso machines?), he decides he should specify for each machine
There are two questions related to the description below. This is question 1 of 2.  Janelle is a microbiologist at the CDC studying the pathogenicity of Clostridioides difficile, the bacterium responsible for sepsis. She compared the sequences of gene NTA587 between a normal strain of C. difficile and an antibiotic resistant strain, and found two nucleotides differences between them.  The mRNA transcribed from each bacterium's genome is below. You can see the nucleotide differences in the context of the codons that they are part of. Use the codon chart provided to determine whether either of the mutations result in changes to the amino acid sequence.  QUESTION: What type of mutation is Mutation #1?

Each time Helge makes a purchase, the company records the suppliers name, address, date, specific items purchased, price paid for each, and the total amount spent. Helge later researches the inventory items to set the customer price. The company assigns an inventory number to each item purchased and records the customer price for each item. Helge buys price tags and display supplies from Alwin Incorporated, a company that sells them at all trade conventions. All inventory and supplies purchases are immediately paid for with cash or with checks from a bank account in Helge's name. All cash received from sales are also deposited to the same bank account. Several times a year Helge rents display space at dealer conventions. A deposit is always required, and the entire fee is due the day the convention starts.

Cell adhesion molecules were first identified through their ability to allow cells to interact to each other as well as to the extracellular matrix. Thus, this type of adhesion molecules not only promotes adhesion but also allows cells to interact and communicate with each other and their environment and, in doing so, regulates a range of cell functions, including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration. What type of cell adhesion molecule is associated with cells being held together by adherens junctions at the site of the interaction?

Passage 1           As American society has grown more diverse, the conventional funeral service has become, for many, a thing of the past. Today, to accommodate the greater variety of religions practiced in the United States, funeral directors are offering a wider range of rituals to honor the dead. In addition, since there is no longer only one way to deal with the death of a loved one, families are now developing their own uniquely customized  funerals. For example, they may choose to play a particular kind of music--classical, rap, folk, rock, or ethnic--during the funeral home's visitation hours. All types of food and drinks, even alcoholic beverages, are served at the viewing or after the funeral service. Some families display collages of pictures or show a personally created slide show or DVD continuously during visitation to allow mourners to remember the life of the deceased person.             One unconventional funeral practice gaining popularity is the "drive-through mortuary." Upon pulling up to a funeral home's drive-through window, mourners can view the dead body, sign a guest register, and pay their respects--all without getting out of their car. Although this approach could be considered a callous way to honor the decedent, such an option accommodates a culture that values convenience as well as efficiency.             Cremation is on the rise in the United States, and some services have capitalized on high-tech solutions for the cremated remains. For instance, a loved one's ashes might be rocketed into outer space. Companies are now manufacturing containers for ashes in a variety of shapes: a motorcycle gas tank, a fiddle, a stuffed animal, a heart, a car--basically any item the deceased person valued. Additionally, individually hand-crafted "cremation jewelry" can hold the decedent's ashes in a pendant worn around the neck.           The Internet offers several high-tech approaches to death rituals. One of these is an "electronic memorial," created on an Internet website, where pictures of the deceased are displayed along with a written life story, family history, and remembrances from relatives and friends. Cyber-mourners may post condolence messages, share their grief, and receive emotional support. "Virtual cemeteries" feature photos and biographical information about the person who died and provide a chance for mourners to sign a guest book or leave "digital flowers." Blogs, social networks such as MySpace and Facebook, and instant messages allow people to pay tribute to deceased loved ones while also providing opportunities to connect and gain support.           Other high-tech innovations reflect the variety of ways people now handle death rituals. For instance, some cemeteries offer special grave markers that contain a small video monitor displaying up to 250 pages of information about the deceased; thus, while standing at the grave site, a mourner can view the entire life of the person buried below. And funeral homes now make video recordings of the funeral service to sell to friends and relatives who cannot attend. Digital cameras can even transmit live video images of a funeral via the Internet. 3. What is the relationship between the parts of the following sentence? "Although this approach could be considered a callous way to honor the decedent, such an option accommodates a culture that values convenience as well as efficiency." (lines 14-15)

Following discovery, Mr. Remington moved for summary judgment on Mr. Wang's product liability claim. Remember that under New Mexico state law, Wang has to demonstrate that (1) the product was defective and/or unreasonably dangerous, (2) the defect existed at the time the product left the manufacturer's control, and (3) the plaintiff's injury was proximately caused by the defective product.  Remember also that the plaintiff must show that his injury was caused by the alleged defect. Stated differently, the plaintiff must prove that the injury is traceable to the product's defect.  Mr. Remington's attorney believes that Mr. Wang will be unable to show that Mr. Remington's heater caused his injuries.             The pertinent evidence in the record includes the following:   (1) Product Testing Video: This video shows various product testing scenarios for the Mr. Remington heater design that allegedly injured Mr. Wang. The video shows the heater being used as advised, with no adverse consequence.  It also shows the heater being used in ways that are ill-advised, such as leaving the heater unattended, again with no adverse consequences.    (2) Wang's Personal Video. On the night of the accident, Jim Wang took a video of their camping trip. In the video, and about an hour before the accident, Jim Wang panned the camera around their tent.  One can see the Mr. Remington portable heater working in the corner.  One can also see a number of citronella candles set up in the tent, all lit as it was high mosquito season.  Finally, one can see a portable butane lantern perched on a small, portable table near the entrance to their tent.     (3) Porter Deposition. Lisa Porter is an expert with respect to fire and fire-related injuries. In her deposition, she stated that Dave Wang's injuries were consistent with a large contained fire.  However, she argued that the injuries were due mostly to being trapped in a contained area.  Had the fire started and Mr. Wang been able to properly exit his tent, he would not have been injured at all, or at least not as severely. In other words, Mr. Wang's camp set-up, and not the heater itself, caused his injuries.    (4) Dave Wang Deposition. When deposed, Dave Wang, stated that he was in the tent lighting an additional citronella candle when he smelled gas. He then turned to see that there was a small fire near the Mr. Remington heater. Before he could get to the fire extinguisher, the fire spread throughout the tent and trapped him inside.  When asked about whether he specifically saw the Mr. Remington heater cause the small fire, Mr. Wang answered no.  When asked whether he thought anything else in the tent may have caused the fire, Mr. Wang also answered no.  He explained that the citronella candles and butane lamp were nowhere near where the fire started.    (5) Todd Black. Todd Black is also an expert with respect to fire and fire-related injuries.  In his deposition, he found the evidence to be inconclusive.  In other words, it is not clear what caused Mr. Wang's injuries, the tent being poorly arranged or the allegedly defective heater.

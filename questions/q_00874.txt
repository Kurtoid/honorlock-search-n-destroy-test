Questions 16 through 19 are based on the following information Flying Dog, Inc. manufactures parachutes for dogs.  Its costing system uses two cost categories, direct materials and conversion costs. Each product must pass through the Assembly Department and the Testing Department. Direct materials are added at the beginning of the production process. Conversion costs are allocated evenly throughout production. Flying Dog, Inc. uses weighted-average costing. The assistant controller has prepared a schedule calculating the cost per equivalent unit for the Assembly Department for the month of April (shown below).  Answer the following questions based on the information in the schedule.       Equivalent Units    Physical  Direct  Conversion    Units  Materials  Costs   Output in terms of equivalent units:        Completed and transferred out during April 1000  1000  1000   Work in process, ending inventory 200  200  60   Total work done to date 1200  1200  1060           Costs:        Work in process, beginning inventory    $ 365,000   $ 360,000   Costs added in April    $ 700,000   $ 1,230,000   Total costs incurred to date    $ 1,065,000    $ 1,590,000           Cost per equivalent unit:        Costs incurred to date      $1,065,000    $1,590,000   Divide by equivalent units of work done to date                    1,200                   1,060   Cost per equivalent unit done to date    $ 887.50    $ 1,500.00

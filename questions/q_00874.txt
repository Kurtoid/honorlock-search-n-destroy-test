For all MOSFET problems the same device diagram and table are employed. Value of the input voltage VDD is provided below the table. Work on the problem on your work sheet completely once to calculate all quantities listed in this question, but answer what is asked in this question and each of the subsequent questions so points are awarded by auto grading system for each question. You do not need to work separately on each question of the MOSFET problem again.     A discrete MOSFET is biased with resistors as shown in the Figure.  For the NMOS the following values are given in the table below.  Ignore the channel length modulation. Answer the questions below. No partial credits for misreading the given data, for not showing the needed equations and substitutions in all steps or for showing incorrect steps                                           VDD                                Variable   NMOS Transistor     mnCox (mA/V2)   0.45     Vt (V)   0.45     VS  (V)   1.8     L (mm)   0.5    RG1(k

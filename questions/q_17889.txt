Risk assessment studies subject animals to lifetime exposure to a fixed amount of a toxic chemical. The lifetime risk probability is estimated as a frequency (th) at a chemical dose (d). The data on the exam Excel file under the tab "Exam1-Q3&4" are liver cancer responses of five animal groups fed a daily dose of DDT (synthetic insecticides). Based on our empirical knowledge, the relationship between the lifetime risk probability (th) and the chemical dose (d) can be modeled as th = 1 - a* exp (-b*dg) If a is 1, b is 0.1, and g is 0.5, what is the square error (SE) between the actual and the modeled th for the FOURTH (4) group of animals?

Two cylindrical rods, made of materials A and B, are placed end-to-end as shown in the figure.    Each rod is 240 cm in length with a radius of 10 cm. The top and bottom surfaces are insulated. A heat source and a heat sink is placed at either ends of the rod. The source generates energy at a rate of 600 W. You may assume all of this energy is conducted through the rod. At steady state, the temperature distribution in the rods are measured via 8 thermocouples. The temperatures obtained is tabulated below.    Material  x (cm) Temperature (K)   A 50 762.5   100 700   150 637.5   200 575   B 300 464   350 434   400 404   450 374    Based on the data provided, answer the following questions. Upload all your clearly written work.  Determine the temperature at the interface in material A and in material B. (Hint: Plot the temperature vs. x) What is the thermal contact resistance at the interface? Determine the thermal conductivities of the two materials.

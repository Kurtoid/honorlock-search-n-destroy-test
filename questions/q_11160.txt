Coyne Corporation is evaluating a capital investment opportunity. This project would require an initial investment of $36,000 to purchase equipment. The equipment will have a residual value at the end of its life of $5000. The useful life of the equipment is 4 years. The new project is expected to generate additional net cash inflows of $19,000 per year for each of the four years. Coyne's required rate of return is 10%.

Robert's property has the shape of a sector. A total station was used to measure the radius (r=258.63m) and the central angle (a = 76deg30') of the property with a setup on point A.     The SLOPOV can be used to find how precisely the perimeter p of the sector (bold line between B and C) can be determined if you assume sr = +-0.08 m and sa = +-55", and uncorrelated measurements. Some quantities are required along the way to solve this problem. Note: The perimeter of a sector can be computed as follows:

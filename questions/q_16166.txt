Mike Bowman was seated quietly with his wife and two children on a park bench at a Massachusetts Donald Trump "Make America Great Again" Rally in Spring of 2021. They were enjoying the friendly crowds waiting for the former President's comments. Suddenly three park rangers approached Mike and informed him he was under arrest.  Completely in the dark about why they had arrested him, Mike questioned the officers about why they had taken him into custody.  The lead officer replied, "because you have violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 264, Section 5."  Inquiring about the content of that statute, the officers explained, "It's your pants. You are treating the U.S. Flag contemptuously in violation of state law. In fact, there was a small cloth American flag sewn to Mike's blue jeans on the area covering his left buttock. Paying bail and being released Mike contacted a public defender to get more information.  He met with public defender Sam Shark.  Sam first showed Mike a copy of the Massachusetts statute the arresting officer had referred to:  Section 5 provides: Whoever publicly burns or otherwise mutilates, tramples upon, defaces or treats contemptuously the flag of the United States or of Massachusetts, whether such flag is public or private property, inside or outside one's residence, or whoever displays such flag or any representation thereof upon which are words, figures, advertisements, or designs, . . . shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.  Sam's also shared his further research. That research revealed that the statute had been applied in a variety of cases.  Included among which were the following incidents, each of these incidents was reported to the local prosecutor by either a mailman, a police officer, a parking meter-maid, or simply a concerned citizen:  Exhibiting the flag with a clenched fist. Exhibiting the flag while making obscene gestures. Residential citizens who had placed the flag hanging from their porch in odd orientations. Wearing the flag as a piece of clothing.   Displaying the flag while acting out or speaking words that which many Americans might consider obnoxious. Using drinking cups with an image of the flag imprinted on it.  Using the flag as a tablecloth for meals. Using disposable picnic napkins had the flag printed on them.  Wrapping the flag around oneself as a windbreaker.  Wearing a soiled T-Shirt with a flag printed on it.     After discussing these materials, Sam, the public defender, shared with Mike that he had no idea where to begin with the case. He is urging Mike to plead guilty and seek a plea deal from the prosecutor. Concerned that his attorney may not be up to the task, Mike has come to your firm for help.   Your managing partner has instructed you to analyze the foregoing facts and law. He indicated that he thought there might be a problem with the "principles of legality."  Your managing partner indicated he wants the memo on his desk in 30 minutes. Write a succinct memo considering the legality of the statute and outlining possible lines of defense you believe Mike can assert.

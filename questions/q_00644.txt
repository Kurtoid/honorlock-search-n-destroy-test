A tall, yellow pea plant (homozygous for both traits) was crossed with a short, green pea plant (homozygous for both traits).  All of the offspring were yellow and tall. In the table below, fill out the Punnett square showing the offspring created by crossing the F1 generation.  The gametes should be written in the spaces in the top row of the square (you do not have to write them in the female area).  The offspring are in the spaces below.  When finished, write out the phenotypes and their ratios in the spaces below the Punnett square.

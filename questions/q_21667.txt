Carefully consider the figure (look at the arrow) and answer the following.  a) Consider the starting material:  How many new acyl groups would form in the presence of MnO2? (number only) [MnO] b) Consider the starting material: What would be the configuration of the chiral center that possesses the vicinal diol? [RS1] c) Consider the starting material: What would be the configuration of the chiral center that possesses the OBn group? [RS2]  d) In order to transform the starting material into the target molecule, it would require the presence of a dehydrating catalyst and what other molecule? [ae] e) In order to completely hydrogenate the target molecule, how many equivalents of H2 gas in the presence of a transition catalyst would be required? (number only) [H2] f) The TBDPS group is a shorthand notation for another bulky silyl ether protection group.  The letters of this shorthand notation stands for t-butyldipropylsilyl.  Consider the structure of this group and determine the splitting pattern of the most upfield signal.

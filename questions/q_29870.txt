Genes that code for the proteins that make up the mitochondria are located in the DNA of the nucleus of the host cell and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). A number of mutations in these genes cause serious clinical features in humans such as neurological problems, muscle weakness, exercise-induced cramps and fatigue. One of the mutations in the mtDNA of skeletal muscle cells encodes a defective cytochrome b of Complex III which prevents oxidation of Coenzyme QH2. Individuals born with this mutation can survive into adulthood with mild to severe clinical features mentioned above.

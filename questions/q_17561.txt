In this problem we are given as input a directed graph G=(V,E) and a designated vertex z*.  Each edge e has a positive length w(e).  Our goal is to design an algorithm which outputs the set of all vertices for which the distance from z* to this vertex is more than twice the distance from this vertex to z*.  In other words, we want to output a list of all vertices w for which dist(z*,w) > 2dist(w,z*).Note, dist(x,y) denotes the length of the shortest path from x to y. Give the fastest (in O() notation) algorithm you can for this problem.  You need to clearly state the running time in terms of n=|V| and m=|E| of your algorithm. Give a very clear and complete description of your algorithm  in words (this is required).  You can also include pseudocode if that will help clarify your algorithm (but if you just give pseudocode without explaining in words you will lose points). You can (and should) use the algorithms from class, such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, SCC, or topologically sorting. You should use them as a black-box.  If you attempt to modify one of these algorithms you will not receive full credit, even if it is correct.

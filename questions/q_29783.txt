One of the first techniques that malicious users try is to probe hosts to identify any __________ ports.
History is very much a written craft--most of what we know and study is what we read.  That makes narratives vitally important to any historian trying to understand and assess the past.  But this can range from private letters to public speeches, and be addressed implicitly or explicitly to every audience imaginable!  How to sort out what happened then--how to reconstruct what was (or what might have been)?  Well, we inquire, explore, ask, answer, and ask some more. In this exam, you'll do just that. For this exam, select one of three chapters in After the Fact: Serving Time in Virginia, Declaring Independence, or Jackson's Frontier, and use it to start an inquiry.  ATF is based on the very idea of how historians go about their work, and you'll take the lead handed you by ATF to dig deeper.  In your essay of 800-1000 words, tell me what chapter you've selected, very briefly what Davidson and Lytle argue in it, and then what questions you think they've raised but left unanswered.  If you had the job of revising ATF for the next addition by adding a follow-up to your chosen chapter, what would you ask?  How might you go about finding an answer? Where might the related sources in TSB lead us, for example?  The whole point is to prove to me that you did this reading, understood it, and now can mull it to become an active investigator/researcher/explorer yourself.  I expect to see both substance and creativity, evidence from ATF, TSB, and your own brain at work.

What is the topic of the following passage? Four common factors contribute to small business failure.  One major problem is managerial incompetence or inexperience.  If managers do not know how to make basic decisions, they are unlikely to make them effectively.  A second contributor to failure is neglect.  That is, after the glamour and excitement of the big grand opening, some entrepreneurs get discouraged and don't concentrate as much on their business as they should....Third, weak control systems can also be a cause of failure.  If control systems fail to alert managers to impending problems, they are likely to be caught unprepared to deal with them.  Finally, many small businesses fail because the owner does not have enough capital to keep it going.  New business owners are almost certain to fail if they expect to pay the second month's rent from the first month's profits.

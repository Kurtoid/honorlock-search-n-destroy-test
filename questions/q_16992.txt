A paper supply company ran an advertisement offering rolls of cash register tape for sale for $10 a roll, minimum purchase of 100 rolls. In response to the advertisement, an office supply retailer sent a written order to the paper supply company for 150 rolls of register tape. In the letter that accompanied the retailer's order, the retailer stated that it would send the paper supply company payment of $1,500 upon delivery.

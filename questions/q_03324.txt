Carbon Dioxide Removal (Canvas Q22~29, Handwritten Q22/23/26) Carbon dioxide is produced by humans as a byproduct of metabolism. In high concentrations, carbon dioxide can be quite toxic: levels of 2~5% in the air can cause respiratory distress, 5~10% can cause confusion and nausea, and levels higher than 10% can lead to unconsciousness and even be fatal. As such, removing carbon dioxide from the submarine air ("scrubbing" the atmosphere) is crucial to the ability of a submarine to stay submerged for extended periods of time. In older submarines used around the end of World War II, lithium hydroxide was used as a carbon dioxide scrubber: after absorbing carbon dioxide, lithium carbonate and water are produced. This was an irreversible solution: the submarines did not have the capability to regenerate the lithium hydroxide, and so a submarine would have a limited amount of time they can spend underwater.

An automated repair center needs to complete 100 maintenance jobs in the next three days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday), of which 50 will arrive on Monday morning and 50 on Tuesday morning. Two repair robots are available: regular and advanced. Due to other activities, the number of jobs that each can complete per day varies: regular robot can complete [r1] jobs on Monday, [r2] on Tuesday and [r3] on Wednesday; advanced robot can do 50 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday and 40 on Wednesday. Assigning a job to the regular robot is free, while assigning a job to the advanced robot costs $100 on Monday, $400 on Tuesday and $600 on Wednesday. Additionally, each day that a job is not completed costs $150. The problem is to determine how many jobs each robot performs on each day so that the total cost is minimized. Draw a network, so that solving the minimum cost flow problem on it gives the optimal solution. On your paper, draw the network and explain your solution. Leave the field below blank. You do not need to find the optimal solution. Hint: create two nodes with ``supply'' of jobs for each of the two days, nodes to represent each robot on each day, and an additional node to collect all completed jobs. Make sure each arc has cost and capacity.

Read the original source and the paraphrase beneath it. If the writer's paraphrase of the original source contains an error, choose the option that describes the error. If the paraphrase has no errors, choose "The paraphrase is acceptable." ORIGINAL SOURCE Signs of extreme tension. Many subjects showed signs of nervousness in the experimental situation, and especially upon administering the more powerful shocks. In a large number of cases the degree of tension reached extremes that are rarely seen in sociopsychological laboratory studies. Subjects were observed to sweat, tremble, stutter, bite their lips, groan, and dig their fingernails into their flesh. These were characteristic rather than exceptional responses to the experiment.--Stanley Milgram, "Behavioral Study of Obedience," 1963, p. 376. PARAPHRASEIn his experiments on obedience to authority figures, Milgram (1963) noted that subjects exhibited "signs of extreme tension." Reactions such as perspiring and groaning were, at the time, unprecedented in sociopsychological studies, and they disturbed researchers overseeing the experiments (p. 376).
Conectate al mundo hispano  En algunas partes del mundo hispano, un termino para un fin de semana largo es un puente (bridge).

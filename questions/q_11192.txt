In the case of PTSD, however, while depression symptoms such as memory and concentration can be reversed with the treatment, exaggerated fear is not easily reversed.  b. Name one brain region associated with stress and fear.  Antidepressant treatment can help with these symptoms, but permanent reversal of cellular damage does not occur.  Patients with retractable PTSD often do respond to either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT, cognitive training that focuses realistic and positive scenarios ) OR exposure therapy (like the virtual reality (VR) therapy we saw in PSS).

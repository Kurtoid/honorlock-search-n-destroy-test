Operative Report Preoperative Diagnosis: Cholecystitis with cholelithiasis Postoperative Diagnosis: Same Operative Procedure: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy Indications: A 77-year-old woman experiences upper abdominal pain and has been diagnosed with cholelithiasis. The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained in detail. Technique: With the patient under general anesthesia, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A small infraumbilical skin incision was made, carried down through the adipose tissue. The fascia was opened in the midline, and the peritoneal cavity under vision using laparoscopic technique. There was adequate insulfation of CO2. A 10-mm trocar was introduced into the upper abdomen to the right of the midline, two 55-mm trocars in the right upper quadrant area under directed camera vision. Examination noted that there were multiple adhesions in the gallbladder area. At this point, I was notified that the patient's blood pressure was 150/80 and then dropped to 90/55. The blood pressure was stabilized but the decision was to abort the procedure at this time. All trocars were taken out under direct camera vision. The CO2 was desufflated. Infraumbilical incision was closed using 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular sutures, and Steri-Strips. She will be closely monitored and I will contact her primary care physician to discuss her condition.  For hospital outpatient reporting, what is the correct code assignment?
4. ?Como llega Miguel a su colegio?
Allen entered into a valid contract with Target to buy a Black & Decker Cordless String Trimmer (Weed Eater) on March 1, 2021. Black & Decker boasted about the machine's precision trimming ability. At 8:30 p.m. on March 8, 2021, Allen's 10-year-old son told his dad that he was having his school picture taken the next morning. Allen's son needed a haircut before the photo shoot, and the barber shop was closed for the day. Allen decided to trim his son's hair with the Black & Decker String Trimmer because it was advertised to give a precision cut.  Allen kept the guard on the trimmer, like the Black & Decker product information instructed. However, the precision string trimmer shook violently and practically jumped out of Allen's hands. When the trimmer jerked away from Allen, it cut off the top of his son's right ear. Allen's son had to have his right ear sewn back on and was hospitalized overnight. He has continued to seek medical treatment for pain and scars. His medical expenses now total $6,000. The product literature did not include any warnings except to use the trimmer with the guard in place. Also, there are 1,000 other complaints nationwide about the trimmer shaking and jumping out of the users' hands. Allen obviously thinks something is horribly wrong with his weed eater and hired an attorney to sue for damages. Based on the above information, please answer the following questions in detail:  Under what Louisiana law can Allen file suit against Black & Decker? What must Allen prove to win his case at trial? Please explain in detail. Explain in detail any defenses the manufacturer may have against Allen.

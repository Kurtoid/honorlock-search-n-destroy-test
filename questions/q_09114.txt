When it all clears, only YOU know who you really are. Don't fall prey to the temptation to cheat.. it may seem like a "victimless" crime,  but  you have no idea how it can affect you and those around you.

Examples include improper citation of referenced works, use of commercially available scholarly papers, failure to citesources, or copying another's ideas;* Fabrication- Presenting as genuine, falsified data, citations, or quotations;* Abetting- Helping another student commit an act of academic dishonesty. Examples include allowing a fellow student to copy quiz/examination answers or use one's work as his/her own;* Misrepresentation- Falsification, alteration, or misstatement of the contents of documents, academic works, or other materials related to academic matters, including works substantially done for one class as work done for another without receiving prior approval fromthe instructor.   I agree to uphold and abide by these policies and agree that I am the person legally enrolled in this class and will receive no assistance in any way from others in the class or outside the class during the test. I understand that if any of my video footage, webpage traffic, or mannerisms during the test indicate cheating may have occurred, I may not only forfeit my score on this test, but may also receive an automatic "F" in the course as well as face the possibility of being suspended from school. Everything I do in this test is my own work and reflects my knowledge of the course concepts. I also understand that video review AFTER my grades are listed on my transcript may cause my grade to be converted to an "F," given the review of the video and proctor information that may not be available immediately after the test.

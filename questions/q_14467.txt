Solve this problem on paper and submit at the end via E1sp (scrap paper).  Use your panther ID to solve this Problem. Panther ID digits:     a   b   c   d   e   f   g     Consider the following scenario:Raw exhaust from a meat processing factory contains volatile organic compounds that produce unpleasant and unhealthy odors and fumes. To comply with BACT regulations, the company must install an air pollution control system to treat this exhaust. The company is considering acquiring an incinerator device that runs on natural gas fuel. Other auxiliary pieces needed to build the system include a fan to convey the gases from the exhaust point into the incinerator and the ducts to connect the system from the exhaust point to the stack venting into ambient air. To destroy the pollutants, the temperature of exhaust gases must be raised up to 2,000oF. The characteristics of the exhaust are as follows: Temperature= (a+b+c)x20 degree FahrenheitPressure = 722 mmHgRotameter volumetric flow rate= ab,cde acfm  (actual cubic feet per minute) 1)  Draw a diagram of the system. 2)  Estimate the standard volumetric and mass flow rate of natural gas fuel required to run the incinerator (in ft3/min and lb/min, respectively). At standard conditions, the natural gas fuel has a density of 0.0423 lb/ft3 and an average heating value of 1,100 Btu/ft3 3) A fan with a 7.3 hp (70% efficiency) is used to convey the exhaust into the incinerator. Given this fan power, deduce the pressure drop (in inches of H2O) that must be happening across the air pollution control system in this case. 4)  The company is also considering investing on a heat exchanger that would allow recover some of the heat from the incinerator's vented gases. Specifically, recovering the heat from cooling the gases from 2,000 oF to 1,000 oF and recycling it back into the incinerator. Equipment designed to recycle 50% of the recovered heat will be considered. Based only on the price of the natural gas fuel, $10 per 1,000 std-ft3,  give a rough estimate of the annual fuel savings in $/year if 50% of the incineration heat is recovered and recycled back into the incinerator. Assume:  exhaust gas and vented gas have properties similar to air 100% of the heat produced from combustion of the natural gas fuel is transferred to the incinerator Conversions:   1 m3 = 35.31 ft3                               1 hp = 745.5 W                                            1" H2O = 248.84 Pa

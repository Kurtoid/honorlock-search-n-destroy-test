To identify how to properly implement the hardware expansion, complete the schematic of Fig. 1 by matching some of the signal labels within the schematic to either  [1] some other signal label(s) depicted within the schematic,  [2] the label "VCC", [3] the label "GND", [4] some subset of the signal bus labeled "IN[7:0]", which is to denote the "inputs" of an 8-bit input port,  [5] some subset of the signal bus labeled "OUT[7:0]", which is to denote the "outputs" of an 8-bit output port, or  [6] the label "N/C", which is to denote that no connection should be made.  (NOTE: Some of the labels denoted in items [2]-[6] may not be needed.) Recall that address decoding must only be performed by external circuitry when a single chip select is not sufficient.  For any extraneous circuitry depicted within the schematic, match all signals given for this circuitry to the label "N/C", and take this to mean that this circuitry is not utilized.   Fig. 1. Hardware expansion schematic. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Within the matching pairs given below, signals associated with the microcontroller (e.g., "PK[7:0]", "PJ[7:0]", etc.) and signals "K", "N", "S", "U", "W", and "Y" are not listed on the left-hand side. This was done for several reasons, but the primary reason was that some of these signals may need to connect to multiple other signals, and Canvas does not offer any good way of having multiple matches for a single item. To circumvent this and other issues, these signals are given on the right-hand side of each matching pair, which successfully allows them to be matched with all other applicable signals, if any. Additionally, recognize that some of these signals are already utilized by circuitry depicted above, e.g., within the box labeled "External Circuitry", signals "PH6" and "PH4", which come from the microcontroller, are each connected to multiple logic gates. Separately, in addition to single signal busses, note that some of the given matching options may represent any combination of [1] a concatenation of some signal busses (i.e., multiple signal busses grouped together into a single bus), [2] the result of some logical NOT operation, denoted with the forward slash (/) symbol, [3] the result of some logical AND operation, denoted with the asterisk (*) symbol, or  [4] the result of some logical OR operation, denoted with the plus (+) symbol. For [1], the comma (,) symbol is used. More specifically, for any two signal busses S1[n1-1:0] and S2[n2-1:0], where S1 is an n1-bit binary number and S2 is an n2-bit binary number, "(S1, S2)" is an (n1+n2)-bit binary number, where the most-significant n1 bits represent S1 and the least-significant n2 bits represent S2. As an example, "(K[7:0], A[7:0])" would represent a bus of sixteen signals, where the most-significant eight signals are K[7:0] and the least-significant eight signals are A[7:0]. Lastly, in regard to [2], [3], and [4], you may assume that any resulting signal has the activation level that is most convenient for the above schematic. (Remember that the result of a Boolean operation, e.g., "F[7] * F[6] * F[5]" can be represented with either an active-high signal or an active-low signal, e.g., the example equation just given could be implemented with both an AND and NAND logic gate.) However, for all matching options below, there should only be one correct answer.

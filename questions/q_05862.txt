The director of research and development is testing a new drug. She wants to know if there is evidence at the 0.10 level that the drug stays in the system for more than 333 minutes.  For a sample of 6 patients, the average time the drug stayed in the system was 338 minutes with a sample standard deviation of 18.  Assume the population distribution is approximately normal.  At the 10% level of significance, is there evidence to support the claim that that drug stays in the system for more than 333 minutes.  Step 1: Specify the null and alternative hypotheses (you must enter the parameters or no credit will be given for the hypotheses -- you can use the equation editor to insert symbols): Step 2.

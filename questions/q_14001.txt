When administered according to a careful feeding schedule, a premium nutritional additive called Supercowchow increases milk production earnings in  a dairy herd to $1,050,000 from the $1,000,000 using the stndard Cowchow that costs $50 a sack for the farmer to buy. The farmer uses 1,000 sacks of Cowchow a year. Supercowchow costs $10 per sack extra to manufacture and the farmer would use 1,000 sacks of it.  Thus the added value of Supercowchow per sack is $50,000/1,000, which is $50/sack. Which of the following would be the farmer's highest acceptable price for the new Supercowchow per sack?

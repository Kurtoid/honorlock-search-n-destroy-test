Blinn allows excused absences for military service, religious holidays, and official school functions. The student may also petition to have one week of absences excused during the semester for other reasons such as illness. In order to petition for an excused absence, whether for a Blinn-excused absence, or for any other reason such as illness, you must email the professor by the end of the week of the absence, letting her know the reason for your absence, and you must attach official documentation (doctor's note, funeral notice, court documents, etc.). You will not be able to make up quizzes, chapter note assignments, or discussion forums if you are absent, whether you have an excused absence or an unexcused absence. If you miss an exam deadline, you must email the professor by the end of the day of the missed exam in order to petition for an excused absence and a make-up exam. You will need to email a copy of your official documentation. If the excused absence is granted, you must take the make-up exam within 48 hours of the missed exam deadline. You may receive a different exam than the rest of the class.  In the case of the Final Exam, deviations from the exam schedule are not acceptable and there may be no make-up exam. If you miss the Final Exam, you will receive a grade of 0 for the Final Exam.

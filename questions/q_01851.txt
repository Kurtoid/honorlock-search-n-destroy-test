Matching: NOTE: ANSWERS MAY BE USED MORE THAN ONCE  Floods out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and is the final chemical messenger and "trigger" for muscle contraction when it binds to troponin.   A neurotransmitter released at the synaptic cleft from motor axon terminals. Diffuses across the cell membrane resulting in depolarization. Causes synaptic vesicles in axon terminals to fuse with plasma membrane of axon terminal. Is used to convert ADP to ATP by transfer of a high-energy phosphate group. It is a reserve high-energy compound found in the sarcoplasm.  Breaks down acetylcholine into its building blocks, rendering it ineffective.

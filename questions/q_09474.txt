At the beginning of the experiment the volumes in both arms are the same, and the level of the liquid is therefore at the same height. The membrane is permeable to water and to sodium and chloride ions, but not to glucose. The apparatus is allowed to stand for three days.      Water molecules will tend to move from Side Y to Side X because the net movement of water molecules will be from the solution with the lower osmotic concentration to the solution with the higher osmotic concentration.

Problem 2 Kim Kinner withdraws $500 from her checking account at Corner Bank and keeps it in her wallet. a) How will the withdrawal change the T-account of Corner Bank? How will it change the money supply? b) If the bank maintains a reserve ratio of 20 %, how will it respond to the withdrawal? Assume that the bank responds to insufficient reserves by reducing the amount of deposits it holds until its level of reserves satisfies its required reserve ratio. The bank reduces its deposits by calling in some of its loans, forcing borrowers to pay back these loans by taking cash from their checking deposits (at the same bank) to make repayment. c) If every time the bank decreases its loans, checkable bank deposits fall by the amount of the loan, by how much will the money supply in the economy change in response to Kim's withdrawal of $500? d) If every time the bank decreases its loans, checkable bank deposits fall by the amount of the loan and the bank maintains a reserve ratio of 10%, by how much will the money supply change in response to a withdrawal of $500?

In March 2000, the New York Times conducted "a telephone poll of a random sample of 1003 adults in all 50 states giving all phone numbers, listed and unlisted, an equal chance of being included." We can treat this as a simple random sample. The adults in the sample were asked to indicate whether or not they agree with the following statement, "I'm offended by most of what I see on American television." If 53% of the sample indicated agreement with the statement, carry out a hypothesis test using a 2% significance level to answer the question:  "Do more than half of all adults agree with the statement?". Based on the p-value you calculated, determine your conclusion.   We should [x] the null hypothesis, because the p-value is [y] than the significance level of 2%. There is [z] evidence to conclude that more than half of all adults agree with the statement.

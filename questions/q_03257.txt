No coughing is noted. The arterial blood gas on the nonrebreathing mask is: pH 7.34; PCO2 46 mm Hg; partial pressure of oxygen in the arteries (PO2) is 52 mm Hg; oxygen saturation is 86%; bicarbonate (HCO3-) is 24 mEq/L. The patient is diaphoretic. The most appropriate ventilator mode to manage this patient initially is which of the following?

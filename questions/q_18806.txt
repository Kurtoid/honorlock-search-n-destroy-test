(1) (10 points) A solid pipe with a 90 degree bend is attached to a rigid wall at point A. Three forces are applied at point B: a 500 N force in the positive X-direction, a 200 N force in the negative Y-direction, and a 300 N force in the positive Z-direction.   At cross-section C, answer "yes" or "no" if the following stress occurs due to the 500 N force. Consider the entire plane, not a particular point on the plane. Clearly label your answers on your solution sheet. (a) Normal stress in the X-direction due an axial force in the X axis. __________ (b) Normal stress in the X-direction due to bending about the Y axis. __________ (c) Normal stress in the X-direction due to bending about the Z axis. __________ (d) Shear stress due to torsion around the X axis. __________ (e) Shear stress due to transverse shear force. ___________   At cross-section C, answer "yes" or "no" if the following stress occurs due to the 300 N force. Consider the entire plane, not a particular point on the plane. Clearly label your answers on your solution sheet. (f) Normal stress in the X-direction due an axial force in the X axis. __________ (g) Normal stress in the X-direction due to bending about the Y axis. __________ (h) Normal stress in the X-direction due to bending about the Z axis. __________ (i) Shear stress due to torsion around the X axis. __________ (j) Shear stress due to transverse shear force. ___________
The yearly cost to educate one student  years after 2000 can be modeled by   1[a]00  dollars per student.  In 20[t], there were 1[s]00 students in an elementary school, and enrollment is increasing by [ds]5 students per year.    How fast is is the cost to educate ALL students at the school changing in 20[t]?   Give your answer in dollars per year without units.  Round your answer to two decimal places.

This study investigated the efficacy of 3 different types of herbicide on plant growth. One herbicide was applied to leaves (Glyphosate), one herbicide was applied to roots (Simazine), and one herbicide was applied to both roots and leaves (Versatil). Test the following planned comparisons for herbicide (independent variable) on the biomass of damaged plant tissue (dependent variable). Perform a single-factor (one-way) ANOVA with planned comparisons for the herb dataset. You may have to set herbicide as a factor using the function as.factor().

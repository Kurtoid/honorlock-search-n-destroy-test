A clean dry crucible weighs 51.024 g. A sample of an unknown metal is added to the dish so that the total mass of the crucible and metal is 58.374 g. The crucible is heated until the metal starts burning and it is allowed to burn until the reaction is complete, producing a single product. After heating the mass of crucible and product is 60.925 g. For each answer, enter the VALUE and UNIT with one space between them. Round each answer if needed to show correct sig figs, but use unrounded values in subsequent steps. You must show your work with sig figs, units and circled answers in your upload for full credit. What is the mass of the metal before heating? [metal] What is the mass of the product? [prod] Calculate the % metal in the product? [perc]

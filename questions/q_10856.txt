During a coffee break the union negotiator tells you he understands where you are coming from but there's only so much money to go around, and his people want as much as possible. Back at the table, you ask the union negotiator if he would put the retirement plan and health care plan on the table as well so you could make an offer to increase their wages. He refuses.

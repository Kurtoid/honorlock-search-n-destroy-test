Consider a new reading program tried with a group of 60 fifth graders as a particular school within a larger district.  Suppose that on a valid, standardized test that participants as a group increased their reading level from an average of 5.1 (early fifth grade level) as of Sept. 5, 2014 to an average of 6.2 (early sixth grade level) as of June 5, 2015.  Briefly explain how maturation and history may be plausible alternative explanations for the increase in reading level. Briefly describe how some form of comparison group design might be designed and used to roughly address these two threats to internal validity.

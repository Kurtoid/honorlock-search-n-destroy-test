In order to prevail on this cause of action, a plaintiff must establish that the employer (1) took a negative employment action against the plaintiff (which can include a denial of promotion), and (2) that action was motivated at least in part on the basis of the plaintiff's religion. As relevant to the claim, the plaintiff's complaint alleges: * Plaintiff often wears religious items to work, making his employer and fellow employees aware of his religion. * The employer internally advertised two promotion opportunities for employees in the plaintiff's department.* Three persons applied for the promotion, including plaintiff.* Plaintiff had more experience than, and the same educational credentials as, the other two applicants.* Of the three applicants, only Plaintiff was a member of Plaintiff's religion.* The employer selected the other two applicants to receive the promotions and rejected Plaintiff's application for promotion. The employer files a motion to dismiss the claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The employee opposes the motion. Explain what step(s) the court will use to analyze this motion, and how likely it is that the motion will be granted.

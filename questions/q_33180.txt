Match the following pilgrims from "The General Prologue" of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales with the best description of them.
Which of the following entities is wholly owned by the U.S. government and has never gone private?
1) You are interested to study tomato fruit development and factors that influence it. You looked at tomato genetic resource center and picked a tomato mutant with pale green fruit to study. It is an EMS single gene mutation, and you are interested to identify the gene underlying this mutation. Describe the procedure in identifying the gene underlying this mutation. Give the various details/steps involved to score full points (7.5 points). 2) You have identified the gene underlying the mutation to be GREEN and found that GREEN gene is involved in chloroplast development and chlorophyll accumulation in fruits. It is a novel discovery because previously this gene has only been reported to be involved in meristem development in plants. Describe at least 3 methods to support your result that you identified the correct gene and that GREEN gene functions in chloroplast development (5 points). 3) There are multiple genes already known to be involved in chloroplast development. How do you determine the relationship between GREEN that you identified to these other candidates? (5 points) 4) In the meantime, you found another tomato fruit mutant that is gain-of-function mutant of GREEN. What is the anticipated phenotype of fruits of this dominant gain-of-function mutant? (2.5 points)
A patient's record can be released if:
Which constitutional isomer of C6H14 gives only two monochlorination products?
After a thrombotic stroke, timely intervention can salvage the brain tissue around the    infarction.  What is this area called?
OPTIONAL Extra Credit.  Answer up to THREE of the questions below (2 pts each).  Be sure to specify which question or questions you are answering.  These answers are not necessarily meant to be as long as responses to your essay questions, but your answer should address the question clearly.  What is the urban heat island effect? Be specific with regard to what things contribute to this effect. Explain how peatlands are converted into monocultures and the effect on emissions. What does carbon neutral mean?  Describe an example of a carbon neutral industry, policy, factory, or other appropriate entity that could be carbon neutral (as discussed in class materials). What components does a Biosphere Reserve have?  Describe the components. What is ocean acidification? Why is it occurring, what organisms does it affect, and how? What are even- and uneven-aged approaches to forest management?  Give a clear example of each AND one "pro" OR one "con" of each approach.
There is an incline with a 35o slope. The slope is rough. You pull a block of mass 3.0 kg upward along the slope, for a distance of 5 m, at a constant speed of 4.5 m/s. You have to exert a force of 40 N parallel to the slope, as shown in the figure.    What is the magnitude of the work done by friction on the block (in Joules)?
Methyl triflate (MeOTf, shown below) is used by organic chemists as a powerful methylating agent. Methylation of octopamine (shown below) with MeOTf yields synephrine, a vasoconstrictor that has been reported for the treatment of chronic hypotension. Answer the following questions about this reaction.  Which of the molecules shown below (A-F) would be the product of this methylation reaction? [product] What is the mechanism of the reaction? [mechanism] What is the role of MeOTf in this reaction? [role] What is the leaving group in this reaction? [leaving]

Consider an ideal silicon-based MOS capacitor that consists of a uniformly doped n-type silicon (the donor concentration is 3x1015 cm-3, 100% dopant ionized), a 7-nm-thick silicon dioxide, and aluminum as the metal section. The material parameters are listed below: The work function of the aluminum is 4.1 eV; the electron affinity for SiO2 is 0.91 eV, the electron affinity of silicon is 4.05eV; the bandgap of silicon is 1.12 eV.  Let the silicon bulk is electrically grounded and the externally applied voltage (VG) is applied on the aluminum gate terminal.  Assume the system is at the room temperature (T = 300 K).  At such temperature, the intrinsic carrier concentration for silicon is 1010  cm-3 , the dielectric constant for silicon is 11.9; the dielectric constant for SiO2 is 3.9; and the free space permittivity is 8.85x10-14 F/cm.  The electric charge is 1.6x10 -19 C and the Boltzmann constant is 1.38x10-23 J/s.  Answer the following questions:  (3 points) What is the name of the MOS capacitor? [name] (3 points) What is the flat-band voltage of this device? [VFB] V (4 points) What is the threshold voltage of this device? [VT] V (4 points) If VG = 1 V, identify the biasing mode. [mode_1V] (6 points) If VG = -2 V, determine the voltage drop across the oxide layer. [Vox] V

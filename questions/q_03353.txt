In hobbits, hair texture is an incompletely dominant trait. The C allele produces curly hair in homozygosity; the S allele produces straight hair in homozygosity; heterozygotes have wavy hair. Draw a Punnett square to examine a cross between Melilot Goldworthy, a male hobbit with wavy hair, and Daisy Loamsdown, a female hobbit with curly hair. What percentage or fraction of the hobbit children produced by this cross could be expected to have wavy hair? What percentage or fraction could be expected to have straight hair? Wavy: [blank1] Straight: [blank2]

Madison Construction produces two products, wood beams and steel beams. The demand for beams exceeds the firm's production capacity, which is constrained by available direct labor and machine hours.  Direct labor is limited to 2,500 hours per week and machine hours are limited to 1,000 hours per week.  The maximum demand for steel beams is 95 per week; while the maximum demand for wood beams is 100 per week.   Other data for the beams appear below.   Additionally, total weekly beam production cannot exceed 175 beams due to storage constraints.     Steel Beams Wood Beams   Contribution margin per beam $220 $150   Direct labor hours per  beam 130 170   Machine hours per beam 80 120    Management desires that the product mix maximize weekly total contribution margin.  Finish the partially completed linear program model below that would determine the number/quantity of each product to produce in order to maximize weekly total contribution margin.   To complete the model, use variables S, W and TCM which are defined as follows as well as the data provided above.  Please note: you are not being asked to solve the model, only to finish the partially completed model.  S = number/quantity of steel beams and  W = number/quantity of wood beams and TCM = total contribution margin  The objective function is TCM = $[variable1]S + $[variable2]W  The constraints are:  Direct labor constraint is: [variable3]S + [variable4]W

The following figures show the configuration of the flat-roll process.      (h0-hf)/2 = R (1 -cos p) If the angle, p, is very small, cos p = 1 - p^2/2 (a) (2pts) Derive the expression for the roll gap, L, L = [R(h0-hf)]^1/2. (b) (4pts) The roll force, F, is given by, F = LwS, where S is the average true stress of the strip. Explain the process design strategy to reduce the roll force when the workpiece with the fixed-width (w) is fed.

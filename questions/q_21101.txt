Darling Construction specializes in the construction of commercial and industrial buildings. The contractor is experienced in bidding long-term construction projects of this type, with the typical project lasting fifteen to twenty-four months.

Progress toward completion is measured on a cost-to-cost basis. Dobson began work on a lump-sum contract at the beginning of 2021.

A public high school publishes a monthly magazine as part of its journalism class. A student writer for the magazine wrote an article supporting the legalization of marijuana and showed it to his faculty advisor. The advisor told the student that while this issue received significant publicity in their community, in order to discourage drug use, school policy prohibited the magazine from including any drug-related articles. The advisor then told the student not to include the article in the magazine. A few days later, the student and faculty advisor were preparing to upload the electronic files for the magazine to their printer. The advisor was momentarily called away, and the student quickly replaced an article on food trends with his article on the legalization of marijuana. When the magazine came out, the article was the talk of the school. After a brief investigation, the student was removed as a writer for the magazine. The student brought suit against the school, claiming that his removal was a violation of his First Amendment rights under color of law. How should the court rule on this issue?

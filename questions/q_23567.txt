The Soiled Bloomers Venture is a start-up website that will sell potted plants.  They are not sure how well their plants will be received online.  If they get a good market reception in terms of volume, they figure they can sell 100,000 plants per year.  If they get a good market reception in term of price, they will average $10 each.  If they get only moderate reception, they will sell only 75,000 plants and $9.50, respectively.  If they get poor reception, they will sell only 50,000 plants and $9.00 respectively.  They give each scenario an equally likely chance and consider all to be independent of each other.  They know they will have fixed costs of $200,000 per year but are unsure of their variable costs.  If all goes well and their costs are low, the average cost to them per plant will be $5.50.  The most likely cost will be $6.50, but if things go bad, the cost will be $7.50 per plant.   They give each of these possible costs an equally likely chance.  Assume they use the spreadsheet below to run a Monte Carlo analysis to estimate the probability of earning various levels of profit, which will be their wages.  In this spreadsheet used to solve this problem, what would be the likely formula for cell C29 for Sales Volume?

Two elements with stiffness matrices given below are assembled into mesh a structure to form a cantilever beam as shown below.          Scale-up the stiffness matrix for each element to the structure degrees of freedom (5 points) Calculate the stiffness matrix of the unconstrained assembled structure, using the assembly d.o.f. (10 points) Calculate the stiffness matrix of the constrained structure with the cantilevered boundary conditions at the left end, as shown in the figure. (5 points)
Connective statements that signal you are finished with one point and moving on to another are transitions.

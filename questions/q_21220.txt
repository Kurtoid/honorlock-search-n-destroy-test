You have determined that the relationship between the emergence of lactate [La] in the blood with exercise intensity follows the relationship [La] = 0.25*e(0.03*%VO2max). You are now asked to compare the rate of increase in [La] per %VO2 max in groups with 1) heart failure, 2) normal, and 3) patients with Chronic Obstructive Heart disease (COPD).   How would you go about determining whether the rates of [La] production were higher or lower in these populations?   Although more than one answer is possible, choose the best (as usual).

In clinical genetic testing laboratories, the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization on metaphase spreads is being phased out, due to the need for cell culture, the specificity of the probes required, and the limited results that can be obtained from one experiment.  Which of the following techniques is most likely to be used in its place?     A Array comparative genomic hybridization   B G-band karyotyping   C Spectral karyotyping   D Targeted gene sequencing   E Whole genome sequencing

For a DNA strand that contains the sequence AGT in the 5' to 3' direction, what nucleotides are found on the other DNA strand in the 5' to 3' direction?
Soar Incorporated is considering eliminating its mountain bike division, which reported an operating loss for the recent year of $3,000. The division sales for the year were $1,050,000 and the variable costs were $860,000. The fixed costs of the division were $193,000. If the mountain bike division is dropped, 30% of the fixed costs allocated to that division could be eliminated. The impact on operating income for eliminating this business segment would be:
During the polymerase chain reaction, the two DNA strands are separated at 95degC, after which the reaction mixture is cooled to 54degC to allow the primers to hybridize to the DNA strands.Why do primer-template hybrids form instead of parent DNA duplexes?   a) The primers are present in such a large excess that they out-compete the parent strands coming back together.   b) A temperature of 54degC is not sufficiently below the parent strands' Tm for them to recombine.   c) The DNA polymerase binds to the single strands and prevents them from coming back together to form a double helix.   d) The free nucleotides are present in such large excess that they interfere with the parent strands coming back together.

In the figure a small, nonconducting ball of mass m = [m] kg and charge q = [q] x 10-12 C (distributed uniformly through its volume) hangs from an insulating thread that makes an angle th with a vertical, uniformly charged nonconducting sheet (shown in cross section). The surface charge density of the sheet is [sigma] x 10-12 C/m2. Considering the gravitational force on the ball and assuming the sheet extends far vertically and into and out of the page, calculate the surface charge density s of the sheet. Find the angle theta where the ball hangs at equilibrium. Take the gravitational acceleration on Earth to be g = 10 m/s2.

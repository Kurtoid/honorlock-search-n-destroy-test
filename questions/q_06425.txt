For a given VFFS (vertical form fill seal) operation, seal strength has been determined to be CTQ (critical to quality).  Sets of samples provide an overall mean of 8.  Upper and lower specification limits have been determined to be 12 and 4, respectively (USL = 12 and LSL = 4).  Draw two sketches, (1) sample standard deviation = 2.0, and (2) sample standard deviation is 0.5.  (3) If Cp = 2 is necessary to deem the process "six sigma" capable, indicate whether each sketch represents a capable process or not. Note: I suggest writing your answer with pencil and paper, taking a photo and uploading the photo.  Please be neat!  I expect to see values on your sketch for USL, LSL, Process Mean and key divisions for s.  Also, the two sketches should be drawn to about the same scale so that the obvious differences are, well, obvious.

[Publix] Luisa, a Hispanic student at University of Florida, decides to go to her local Publix to buy groceries for the week. When choosing what to buy, she only pays attention to and ultimately purchases foreign brands because this was something her grandmother taught her.

Essay Part 2: Apply Carly  Using the same theory you explained above in Part 1, analyze the scenario below.  Explicitly locate and apply the theory's key concepts to diagnose or explain Carly's experience. For example, if you say that she used active uncertainty reduction, give evidence from the scenario. This section is worth 12 points, so you want to be thorough.  Note: the scenario is based on a real experience* and is somewhat open-ended here. Feel free to speculate or add detail to Carly's experience if it helps you to clarify the theory's concepts. Please underline or bold key terms.     Carly spent a year studying in Germany. She explains a cultural difference that surprised her: In the U.S., I would regularly make brief eye contact and even smile at someone while walking across campus, just to be friendly, to acknowledge them. I hadn't thought about it before, but in the States, we routinely make brief eye contact for a quick moment, then look away. This gesture is like a courtesy, a type of respect between strangers that is almost unnoticeable. But here, in Germany, eye contact with strangers for no apparent reason is a breach of respect; everyone avoids eye contact and no one smiles except in special circumstances. At home, if I bump into someone- like in a crowded store, I will smile and then say 'oh, excuse me.' But when I do that here it is considered strange. I seem like a weird, overly vocal or social person. Last week, I backed up into someone in line at the market and apologized to the woman. She looked at me like I was crazy and turned away! I felt like an idiot. I also felt angry that she would judge me for being polite. What I would normally do to appear friendly and respectful (smile, brief eye contact) is seen as rude here. I have had a hard time changing this behavior--it's almost like a reflex.  *Adapted from Husting, G. (2015). The flayed and exquisite self of travelers. Symbolic Interaction, 38, 213-234.

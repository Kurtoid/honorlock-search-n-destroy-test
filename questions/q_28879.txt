The method of loci, an encoding strategy, consistently enhanced recall in prior studies. In the present research, Pp associated items on one grocery list with locations in a lab room. Experimenters told Pp to be imaginative (e.g., picture a loaf of bread toasting on a light fixture, imagine paper towels moving through a printer, visualize coffee filters holding paper clips).

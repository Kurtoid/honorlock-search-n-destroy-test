You sample the soil using an open-ended metal cylinder (volume of 196.35 cm3 ). The soil occupies the cylinder from end to end. You return the cylinder to the lab and record the following soil data: moist soil mass + cylinder=  580.43 g oven-dry soil mass + cylinder= 504.34 g cylinder mass (without soil)= 200.00 g   Use the information provided to calculate the following (report results to two decimal places and include units when relevant): a.  the bulk density of the soil.         b.  the gravimetric water content of the moist soil. c.  the volumetric water content of the moist soil. d.  Suppose that the oven-dry soil is retained in the metal cylinder (at the same bulk density as above) and you seal the bottom and set it vertically on your desk. Calculate the maximum amount (ml) of water you can pour slowly into the cylinder before it overflows.
A spring stiffness of k = 500 N/m is mounted against the 10-kg block. If the block is subjected to the force of F = 500N, determine the velocity at s = 0.5 m.  When s = 0, the block is at rest and the spring is uncompressed. The contact surface is smooth.

Use the information below to answer the next 5 questions.  Your favorite fungus (because *everyone* has a favorite fungus, of course) called Shroomy favoritus is cultured on V-8 juice agar (yes, some fungi are grown on V-8 juice). The fungus is inoculated onto V-8 juice agar plates by putting a single fungal spore in the center of the plate, and the fungal colony spreads from the center to fill up the plate with mycelium. The diameter of the Petri dish is 65 mm.   You're identifying potential drugs to treat the respiratory disease caused by S. favoritus. Observations lead you to hypothesize that exposing the fungus to drug X will inhibit (slow down) its growth, which would make drug X a good candidate for further study.   To test this hypothesis you prepare V-8 juice agar with drug X (treatment), and without (control). You inoculate the fungus onto both media and measure fungal growth for 7 days. The results of one such are indicated in the graph below; the vertical error bars in the graph indicate that although there is some error in the measurements, the true diameter is likely somewhere in that range. The experiment is repeated three times with similar results.

A student notices that the image produced from a large concave mirror of a distant skyscraper (h = 51 m) is inverted and the magnitude of the height is |hi| = 0.75 m tall. The image is located d = 101 cm in front of the mirror. a) What is the distance from the skyscraper to the mirror? b) What is the focal length of the mirror?
Problem 3   A long sheet metal trough is supported by a continuous hinge along its lower edge and by a series of horizontal cables attached to its upper edge.  A 60 in long section of the trough is shown.  The trough has a quarter circular profile except for a top flat edge that can be neglected. There is one cable for every 20 inches of the trough's length.  The specific weight of the water in the trough is 62.4 lbs/ft3 and the specific weight of sheet metal is 0.10 lb/in2.  Determine the tension in each of the cables at a time when the trough is completely full of water.     Format:  Enter the magnitude of the tension T in each cable with units. T = [t_cable]

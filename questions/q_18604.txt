Gene expression refers to what process?
Alba uses twin research designs to examine the heritability of negative affect in children. One of her studies examines twins reared apart in comparison to twins reared together. She finds that the correlations between dizygotic twins reared apart and dizygotic twins reared together are similar (i.e., they all show similar levels of negative affect). What assumption can be made from this finding?
A patient is found to have increased intracranial pressures upon placement of an intracranial pressure monitor.  Which of the following may be a cause of this finding? Select all that apply.

Suggested format: {name of role 1} = {top, bottom, transport, service, all, etc}; {name of role 2} = {top, bottom, transport, service, all, etc}; etc
You have been hired to evaluate an existing drainage system (10 years old). Find out whether the pipe diameter is adequate to handle the design discharge flow. What is your professional (practical) recommendation to make the drainage system more efficient? Show your recommendation mathematically through calculations; provide a solution to improve the current situation. Below, the existing drainage characteristics are listed:  Drainage coefficient (q): 6 mm/d (from a rainfall frequency distribution, maximum three day duration rainfall occurring once every four years), Lateral drain pipe length: 300 m, Lateral drain pipe spacing: 100 m, Lateral drain pipe diameter: 100 mm (4"), Lateral pipe type: corrugated plastic pipe (n = 0.0145), Hydraulic gradient: 0.1%,  Note: Assume steady-state flow conditions (i.e., uniform flow throughout the pipe length). Also, it is assumed that siltation has occurred and that the drainage discharge flow has been reduced by 25%. This is an evaluation case, not a design case.

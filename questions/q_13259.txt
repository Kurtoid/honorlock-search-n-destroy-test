(c) Today (t=0), February 1, 2020, you enter into a forward rate agreement (FRA) with a bank for the period starting February 1, 2021 to August 1, 2021. Notional amount is $200 million dollars. You enter the FRA as a payer of the fixed rate () and a receiver of the floating rate (). Both rates are semiannually compounded interest rates. What is the value of the FRA at inception (t = 0)? [answer7] Six months later (August 1, 2020 or t = 0.5), you have second thoughts and consider that maybe you should get out of the transaction. You observe the new term structure of interest rates as follows.     t T     0.5 1.0 0.985   0.5 1.5 0.975   0.5 2.0 0.965   0.5 2.5 0.955    What is the value of the FRA on August 1, 2020?[answer8]

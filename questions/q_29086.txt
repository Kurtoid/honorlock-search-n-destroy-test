From these islands . . . there is no tropical product which cannot be raised in abundance. . . . "A much more important point is to be found in the markets which they furnish. The total value of exports and imports for 1896 amounted in round numbers to $29,000,000. . . . There can be no doubt that the islands in our peaceful possession would take from us a very large proportion of their imports. . . . With the development of the islands and the increase of commerce and of business activity the consumption of foreign imports would rapidly advance, and of this increase we should reap the chief benefit. . . .

Even in the absence of new job creation, high turnover in the low-wage job sector guarantees a steady supply of openings to the swift and the desperate. To white-collar job seekers, these are known as "survival jobs"--something to do while waiting for a "real" job to come along.From:Ehrenreich, Barbara.

Use a kh2 test of Association to test the claim that in the given contingency table, the row variable and the column variable are independent.  Be sure to identify and include in your answer the following: the null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, expected values, test statistic, rejection region, conclusion about the null hypothesis, and a final conclusion that addresses the original claim that the two variables are independent (no relationship).    TYPE YOUR ANSWERS ONLY TO EACH STEP IN THE TEXTBOX.  ALL WORK MUST BE SHOWN ON YOUR ANSWER SHEET.  You must show some work / explanation as to how the expected values were calculated. Injection location vs Reaction: Jackson et al. (2013)[1] wanted to know whether it is better to give the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine in either the thigh or the arm, so they collected data on severe reactions to this vaccine in children aged 3 to 6 years old. One nominal variable is reaction type (severe reaction vs. no severe reaction); the other nominal variable is location (thigh vs. arm). (Use a = 0.01). These data were collected[2]:         No Severe Reaction   Severe Reaction     Thigh   26   14     Arm   64   46       [1] Jackson, L.A., Peterson, D., Nelson, J.C., et al. (13 co-authors). 2013.

For the fading channel in the previous question: Assume that a signal with a 50 kHz bandwidth is being transmitted at 2 GHz through this channel to a mobile that is traveling at 21 m/s. Assume that the data rate on this channel is 4kbps and the modulation is BPSK.  What is the maximum Doppler frequency , fm, for this channel? What is the coherence time with correlation >=0.5 for this channel (i.e. using the restrictive, conservative time coherence definition )? Is this a slow fading channel relative to correlation >=0.5  (yes or no) ?  What would the answer to 3. be if the modulation were changed to 256QAM (8 bits/symbol) but the bit rate stayed the same? (Justify your answer)

VRAAG 4     Gebruik die inligting hieronder om die volgende vrae te beantwoord. Jy stoot 'n blik van 7 kg wat op 'n tafelblad rus na regs, en jy moet 'n krag van 6,32 N uitoefen om die blik te laat begin beweeg. As dit eers beweeg, kan jy 'n krag van slegs 3,4 N gebruik om die blik teen 'n konstants spoed te laat beweeg.     4.1   Wat is die grootte en rigting van die normaalkrag?   (2)     4.2   Bereken die statiese wrywingskoeffisient tussen die tafel en die blik.   (2)     4.3   Wat is die kinetiese wrywingskrag?   (2)     4.4   Wat is die resultante/netto krag op die blik terwyl dit beweeg?   (2)     4.5   Teken 'n kragtediagram vir die blik terwyl dit in 'n positiewe rigting na regs beweeg. Maak seker dat jy alle byskrifte en waardes insluit.   (3)             [11]

Based on this developmental case history: Mark was born on January 3, 2012.  His mother was 19 years old when Mark was born and her last menstrual period before birth started 38 weeks before Mark's birth.  She frequently drank alcohol while pregnant and Mark was born with attention issues and a hearing loss as a result.  Aside from this, he does not have any other physical health issues.  His permanent teeth are coming in and he is growing well. At his last check-up he was 81 pounds and 50 inches. Mark lives with his mother, step-father, and two step-sisters.  Mark's father lives in another town and rarely visits Mark, so beyond sending a child-support check, Mark's father is not active in Mark's life.  He is very attached to his mother and prefers it when his step-father is away for work than at home taking up time Mark could spend with his mother.  Mark is pleasant and kind to other people, but a bit rigid with rules.  Because he wants to be sure everyone is treated fairly, he enforces rules even when they put him at a disadvantage. Mark is often fearful of new situations and new kids at school and prefers quiet activities to loud games.  Mark attends 3rd grade at a school for the deaf in his city.   He is constantly comparing himself to the other kids his age and sees that his school work is not as good as theirs largely because he has severe problems paying attention and staying on task .  Mark has the beginnings of logical thought so he can tell that the amount of juice in his skinny cup equals the amount in his step-sisters' fat cups even though they still try to tell him that he got the most juice because his cup is filled higher.  Mark still has trouble understanding hypothetical situations that can never happen in real life, however.  Mark is currently taking a karate class.  He is becoming able to break a board by kicking it, but karate master still needs to help Mark shape his fist in order to punch correctly so that he can break the board with his hands without hurting himself.  His mother encourages Mark to try new things like karate and is always interested in his activities.  Nonetheless, she does make rules for Mark like he must complete his homework for school and chores at home before he can get privileges like extra time at the karate dojo. These rules are flexible based on circumstances, however, like school breaks or karate competitions. Mark's father has no interest or say in what Mark does, however.

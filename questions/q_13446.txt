A particular gene has the following sequence (same sequence as the last question): ORIGINAL SEQUENCE: T - A- C - T - A- G - A- C -A -T - A -T - T -C -C - A - T-  C A bacterial cell containing the above sequence is bombarded with UV rays and the sixth nucleotide in the gene (bolded and underlined above) is mutated from a G to a T. Now the sequence looks like: MUTATED SEQUENCE: T - A- C - T - A- T - A- C -A -T - A -T - T -C -C - A - T-  C Based on the sequence above, do you expect that this mutation will have a large effect on the resulting protein? Explain your answer. Hint: you will have to transcribe and translate the gene again with the new DNA sequence.

To blow glass, a glass blower uses a very long blowpipe (k = 20 W/m*K) to send air to a pool of molten glass. The inner and outer diameters of the blowpipe are 6 mm and 10 mm respectively, and the length is 350 mm. Both the inner and outer surfaces of the blowpipe are exposed to air at T[?] = 25degC and h = 5 W/m2*K. The molten glass is maintained at Tm = 1000degC. What temperature will the glass blower's mouth experience and is it safe?

The solutions in the two arms of a U-tube are separated by a membrane that is permeable to water and glucose but not to sucrose. Side A is half-filled with a solution of 2 M sucrose and 1 M glucose. Side B is half-filled with 1 M sucrose and 2 M glucose. Initially, the liquid levels on both sides are equal.    When the system illustrated above reaches equilibrium, the sugar concentrations on both sides of the U-tube will be ________.

"The Dream of the Rood" In "The Dream of the Rood," what does the term "rood" refer to?
A 2 kg box is against a vertical wall by a small force (F1 = 10N) perpendicular to the surface of the wall, and pushed upward by a Force, Fapp applied to the box vertically. The Force pushes the box up the wall at a constant velocity. There is a coefficient of kinetic friction uk= 0.3 between the box and the wall.  A. Choosing up and to the right as your positive direction, DESCRIBE your force body diagram for the block.   B Determine the value of the applied Force (Fapp) to keep the box moving upward at a constant velocity.

A study on the effects of osteoarthritis on the weight-bearing capacity of knee joints was conducted. The following summary data shows the stance duration (ms) for samples of both older and younger adults. Assume that both stance duration distributions are normal. Age                       n            Sample mean         s Older                  22               780                   97 Younger              18               810                  125   a. Calculate a 90% confidence lower bound for the true stance duration of Younger adults. Lower bound = [LB1] b. Calculate a two-sided 90% confidence interval for the difference between true average stance duration for the older and younger adults. (Use df = 30) Lower bound = [LB] Upper bound= [UB]  c. True or False. It is plausible that there is no difference in the true average stance duration among older individuals and younger individuals. This is [plausible]

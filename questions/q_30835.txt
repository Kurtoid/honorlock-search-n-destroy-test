Write a function named RollSix that simulates the repeated rolling of one six-sided die until a six is rolled and returns the number of rolls it took to get a six. You should use a Random generator to give an equal chance of rolling a one through six. Each time the die is rolled, you should display the number seen. When you roll a six, you should print the number of trials taken and then return that number. Three example outputs of a call to RollSix are shown below: Rolled: 3 Rolled: 1 Rolled: 6 You got a six in 3 turns! This call should return 3. Rolled: 3 Rolled: 4 Rolled: 3 Rolled: 1 Rolled: 1 Rolled: 6 You got a six in 6 turns! This call should return 6. Rolled: 6 You got a six in 1 turns! This call should return 1.

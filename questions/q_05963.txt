QUESTION 3 - 8 Points Francis was a successful accountant in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Francis owned her own accounting firm that operated under the name "Ace Accounting."  Francis and Ed negotiated an agreement for the sale of her accounting practice.  During the negotiations over the purchase of the assets of Ace Accounting, Ed expressed his concern that after closing on the sale of the accounting practice that Francis would start up a competing accounting practice and steal Ed's customers (because of their loyalty to Francis).  Therefore, part of the sale contract that Francis and Ed both signed and agreed to included the following provision:  "Francis agrees that she shall not perform accounting services for a period of 8 years from the date of this agreement within a 30 mile radius of the current location of Ace Accounting's office in Minneapolis, Minnesota."      In order to determine the price that she should sell her accounting practice for, Francis obtained a market survey that she could present to any prospective buyer.  The market survey determined that 90% of Ace's clients came from within a 25 mile radius of Ace's office location.  Ed and Francis agreed on a purchase price for the accounting practice of $1.5 million, which was determined as follows:  $500,000 in equipment and cash; $500,000 in accounts receivable; and $500,000 in goodwill including the existing customer list.  Ed and Francis closed (consummated and concluded) the sale of the accounting practice on March 30, 2020.  On March 1, 2021, Ed learned that Francis was in the process of opening up a new accounting practice just 10 miles from Ace's office location.  One of Ed's customer's told him that Francis' new office emailed her an invitation to their grand opening.  Ed is obviously very upset about this and believes that Francis' conduct is a violation of the sale agreement.  Ed has filed a lawsuit to try and stop Francis from opening up a new accounting practice in violation of the sale agreement.  REQUIRED (8 Points):  The court in the action commenced by Ed has determined that Francis' conduct is a violation of the sale agreement and has ordered her to not open the new accounting practice.   In separately lettered or numbered paragraphs discuss the reasons why the court enforced Francis' promise not to open a competing accounting practice.

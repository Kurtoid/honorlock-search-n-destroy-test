Fortunately, it was good natured fun and nothing was damaged nor was anyone hurt.  However, it was loud!  Singing, dancing, loud talking, clinking glasses and hoots and hollering abounded.  The party disturbed many neighbours who complained to the landlord.  On October 1, Krystal received the first N5 that she has ever gotten under her door.

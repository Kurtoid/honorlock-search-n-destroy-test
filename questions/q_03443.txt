Aladdin Corp is a consumer products conglomerate with a target debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5. Aladdin's current capital structure matches its target leverage, and its equity beta is 0.75. Aladdin has three divisions: Its foods division (45% of Aladdin's total asset value), a cosmetics division (40% of total asset value), and a cleaning supplies division (15% of total asset value). Aladdin aims to apply the same firm-level target debt-to-equity ratio across all of its divisions, and believes it will be able to borrow at 10% for all divisions. To further estimate costs of capital for its divisions, Aladdin has collected the following information on the average debt-to-equity ratios and equity betas of pure-play companies in each of the food, cosmetics, and cleaning supply industries.     Industry   Average debt-to-equity ratio   Average equity beta     Foods   0.8   0.7     Cosmetics   1.0   1.2     Cleaning Supplies   No pure-play firms available     The risk-free rate is 2%, and the market risk premium is 6%. Given this information, what would be a good estimate of the cost of capital for Aladdin's cleaning supplies division? (Assume no taxes and zero debt beta)

The manager of a retail store is interested to know whether his customers are making  relatively large purchases.  He has randomly sampled 25 customers from the past 3  months, and found that the average sales total for these receipts is $72.17, with a standard deviation of $12.06.  Assuming that the sales totals from all customers over the past 3  months are normally distributed, a 95% confidence interval for the average sales total for all of his customers from the past 3 months is ($67.19, $77.15).  Based on the given   interval, can we conclude at a 5% significance level that the average sales total for all of   his customers from the past 3 months is different from $80?

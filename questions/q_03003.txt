We can see a number of major evolutionary trends across the phylogeny of teleost fishes by comparing "early-diverging" or "primitive" teleosts, such as the primitive members of Euteleostei, against the more "derived" teleosts, such as the Acanthopterygii. In terms of structural (morphological) changes, two of the most obvious and important are:  (1) primitive Euteleostei have the maxilla _____________ in/from the gape (i.e. mouth opening), while derived Acanthopterygii have the maxilla ________________ in/from the gape. (2) primitive Euteleostei tend to have fin spines ________________, while more derived Acanthopterygii fishes tend to have fin spines ______________.

Part 2: Apply Apply the "twin tests" of narrative rationality to the story below. Is the Sheriff likely to believe the Bruins' story? Use the theory's concepts to justify your response.  The Bruins family had been burglarized! They came home from the market only to find their front door open. When they looked inside, Junior's favorite chair was broken chair, and his food had been eaten. Upstairs, they found a girl sleeping in Junior's bed! When they woke her, she just jumped out the window and ran. Mr. Bruins went to the Fairy Town police to report the invasion. This wasn't the first bit of trouble in Fairy Town. Just last week, two kids had been seen eating gum drops off of a neighbor's candy cottage, and the month before that, a Giant reported that a boy stole some magic beans.

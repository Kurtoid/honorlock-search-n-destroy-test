Read the following section from "Myers-Briggs: Identifying Personality Traits and Styles." Then, based on your reading of the selection, choose the most appropriate answer the question that follows the selection. You may be asked one or more questions about the same passage. Myers-Briggs: Identifying Personality Traits and Styles The Myers-Briggs system is one of the most popular personality tests, and it is relatively well known. It has seen a great deal of use in the business world with testing seminars and presentations on group dynamics. In fact, it is so popular that you may already be familiar with it and may have taken a test yourself to find out which of the 16 personality types you most favor. The basic concept of Myers-Briggs is that there are four main traits. These traits are represented by two opposites, seen in the table below.     Extroverted (E)   vs.   Introverted (I)     Intuition (N)   vs.   Sensing (S)     Feeling (F)   vs.   Thinking (T)     Judging (J)   vs.   Perceiving (P)     Table2.5 It is thought that people generally exhibit one trait or the other in each of these categories, or that they fall along a spectrum between the two opposites. For example, an individual might exhibit both Feeling and Thinking personality traits, but they will favor one more than the other. Also note that with each of these traits there is a letter in parentheses. The letter is used to represent the specific traits when they are combined to define a personality type (e.g., Extrovert is E and Introvert is I, Intuition is N, etc.). To better understand these, each is briefly explained. Extroverted (E) vs. Introverted (I): In the Myers-Briggs system, the traits of Extroverted and Introverted are somewhat different from the more common interpretations of the two words. The definition is more about an individual's attitude, interests, and motivation. The extrovert is primarily motivated by the outside world and social interaction, while the introvert is often more motivated by things that are internal to them--things like their own interests. Intuition (N) vs. Sensing (S): This personality trait is classified as a preference toward one way of perceiving or another. It is concerned with how people tend to arrive at conclusions. A person on the intuitive end of the spectrum often perceives things in broader categories. A part of their process for "knowing things" is internal and is often described as having a hunch or a gut feeling. This is opposed to the preferred method of a sensing person, who often looks to direct observation as a means of perception. They prefer to arrive at a conclusion by details and facts, or by testing something with their senses. Feeling (F) vs. Thinking (T): This trait is considered a decision-making process over the information gathered through the perception (N versus S). People that find themselves more on the Feeling end of the spectrum tend to respond based on their feelings and empathy. Examples of this would be conclusions about what is good versus bad or right versus wrong based on how they feel things should be. The Thinking person, on the other hand, arrives at opinions based on reason and logic. For them, feeling has little to do with it. Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P): This category can be thought of as a personal preference for using either the Feeling versus Thinking (decision-making) or the Intuition versus Sensing (perceiving) when forming opinions about the outside world. A person that leans toward the Judging side of the spectrum approaches things in a structured way--usually using Sensing and Thinking traits. The Perceiving person often thinks of structure as somewhat inhibiting. They tend to make more use of Intuition and Feeling in their approach to life.

You are called to a delivery for a 25 week gestation neonate. Mom is Gravida 3, Para 1, (G3, P1) with a history of oligohydramnios and premature rupture of membranes x 2 weeks. She has received 3 doses of betamethasone and is currently receiving IV magnesium sulfate. Mother reports that she smoked 'occasionally' throughout the pregnancy. The L&D nurse reports late decelerations on the fetal heart monitor. She is moved back for a STAT C-section. You prepare the radiant warmer in anticipation of the imminent delivery.   Which of the following will promote lung maturity?

As stated in the instructions above, choose two of these questions to answer:  Choose one of the following pairs of complementary poems from Songs of Innocence and of Experience: a) the two "Chimney Sweepers," b) the two "Nurse's Songs," or c) the two "Holy Thursdays." What does this pair of poems--read together--suggest about Blake's conception of the contrary states of the human soul? Be specific.   Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman is not creative literature and is rooted in Enlightenment Era philosophies that emphasize the value of rational thought and reason. How does her writing reflect and fit into the conception of literature in the Romantic period? (In other words, although it is not canonically Romantic, what principles of Romanticism can be seen in Vindication?)   Using specific evidence from the text, explain in detail why Manfred is a Byronic hero. (Note: I'm asking for textual analysis of Manfred, not for biographical information about Lord Byron.)

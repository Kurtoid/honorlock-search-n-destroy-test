As you know from class, there has been some concerns about the potential effects of ecotourism on shark behavior. A study published in 2016 examined the effects of shark "feeding dives" (also known as shark provisioning) on behavior of whitetip reef sharks, which are a sluggish species that are capable of resting on the seafloor and buccal pumping.  They measured shark activity patterns using accelerometer tags to measure body acceleration. The graph below shows the results of this study.  It shows the activity of sharks during the time at which they were provisioned ("provisioning time") as well as their average activity levels during the day and nights that they were provisioned and the average activity levels on the days and nights that they were not provisioned. Based on these data, is there any evidence that provisioning alters shark behavior in some way?

The underlying processes and molecules of gene expression are typically referred to as the 'Central Dogma of Biology' as they are relatively consistent amongst all living organisms. In eukaryotic organisms specifically, our genes are contained within our _A_ (macromolecule) that is found within the _B_ of a cell. In order to express the gene, we first have to make  _C_ (macromolecule) via the process of _D_.  Following this process, we will modify the molecule produced to prepare it for the next phase. Following modification, the mature _C_ will be moved to the _E_ of the cell where the process of _F_ occurs to produce _G_, which perform the function encoded for by the gene.

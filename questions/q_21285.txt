A firm produces 4 components. Components 1 and 2 have the same size and weight and are equivalent with respect to the movement (thus, a movement factor of 1 is assigned to components 1 and 2). Component 3 is twice as large as component 1 or 2, and component 4 is equivalent to moving half a unit of component 1 or 2. The departments included in the facility are A, B, C, and D. Departments are arranged in a linear flow pattern in the order D-B-C-A.    (a) [10pts] Create the from-to-chart. (b) [10pts] Using the From-To Chart in part a, develop the adjacency graph using the graph-based procedure.

3.2   Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow: Sea urchins release their gametes into environments which may be as small as a tidal pool or as large as an ocean. Immediately following release from the adult, two challenges need to be overcome for fertilisation to take place: 1) the unlikely chance of sperm and eggs meeting in the water in such a dilute concentration, and 2) the sperm being prevented from fertilizing eggs of another species that may also be in the water column at the same time. The high local abundance of adults and the sheer quantity of sperm and eggs that are produced by individual sea urchins is one strategy to increase the odds of gametes making contact with each other in the water column.  Many species have further evolved a mechanism where the egg releases a chemical that attracts the sperm towards the egg.  This means the sperm is only attracted to the eggs of its own species.  Once a zygote is formed it develops into a swimming larva that feeds on algae.

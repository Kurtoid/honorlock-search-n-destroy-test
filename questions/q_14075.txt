State your conclusion to the hypothesis test.A national organization has been working with utilities throughout the nation to find sites for large wind machines that generate electricity. Wind speeds must average more than 22 miles per hour (mph) for a site to be acceptable. Recently, the organization conducted wind speed tests at a particular site. Based on a sample of  n=33  wind speed recordings (taken at random intervals), the wind speed at the site averaged  22.8 mph, with a standard deviation of  4.3 mph. To determine whether the site meets the organization's requirements, perform the following hypothesis test at the 1% significance level and state your conclusion. Ho: m = 22 HA: m > 22

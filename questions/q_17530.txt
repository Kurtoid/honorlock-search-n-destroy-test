For questions 9-13, please refer to the image and scenario detailed here: You are working as a physical therapy assistant. Your first patient for the day arrives at 8:15am. The patient is a 69 year old recovering from knee replacement surgery. The physical therapist is out for the day, but she left you detailed instructions to test the patient for knee strength and range of motion. For this task, you will use an isokinetic knee extension test (see projection on the board). You carefully adjust each part of the testing apparatus for the patient and strap them in. You then instruct them on how to perform the test. You explain that the test will measure the strength of their knee extensor muscles, and will give the physical therapist an objective measure of their recovery progress. Although the patient doesn't need to know this, you know that the machine measures how much torque the person's knee extensors can produce. You also know that torque is a product of:

I would agree with St. Augustine that "an unjust law is no law at all." . . . How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? . . . An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas [a thirteenth-century Christian theologian]: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and changes the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an "I-it" relationship for an "I-thou" relationship and ends relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically, and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation and existential expression of man's tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right, and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.Documentation information for this excerpt: Title of essay: "Letter from Birmingham Jail"Author: Martin Luther KingThe essay is published in the following text: The Norton Reader, 10th ed.Publisher: NortonDate of publication: 2000City: New YorkEditors: Linda H.

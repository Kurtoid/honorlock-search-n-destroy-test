When I was in Uganda, we had to be careful to hang our clothes to dry beneath mosquito netting, because of a species of fly they called a "mango fly." Female mango flies lay their eggs in wet clothing, and when the larva hatch and you put the wet clothing on, the larva will burrow into your skin, and grow there, feeding on your flesh. One of my professors got one, and he said he could feel it in there, moving and growing! Normally, when the larva has developed enough, it will emerge from the skin as an adult fly. My other professors squeezed his out though, before it was ready. He just couldn't stand to wait, and I don't blame him! Which of the three kinds of interaction is this, between mango flies and humans?

Bert was driving north on East 9th Street when his car collided with Ernie's car, driving west on St. Clair Avenue. Both Bert and Ernie suffered serious personal injuries, and both cars were damaged. Bert noticed after the accident that Ernie's car had a bumper sticker proclaiming "Lawyers Do It In Their Briefs." Bert has always loathed bad puns, and he would like to add a cause of action for "annoyance." Assume that Bert sues only Ernie, and that the complaint includes both negligence claims arising out of the car wreck and the claim for annoyance. Ernie is annoyed about Bert's annoyance claim. He believes that Bert personally is sincere but is nonetheless deluded about the claim, which sounds made up. Ernie has heard that Bert's lawyer is a nice guy and tries to do the right thing but got a D in Legal Research and prefers to avoid the library whenever possible. Ernie has a lot of friends who are lawyers (one of whom gave him the offending bumper sticker), and they have told him that there is no such a cause of action for annoyance, and to investigate something called Rule 11. Does the annoyance claim violate Rule 11?

Two concentric spheres are shown in the figure. The inner sphere is a solid nonconductor and carries a charge of +5.00 uC uniformly distributed over its outer surface. The outer sphere is a conducting shell that carries a net charge of -8.00 uC. No other charges are present. The radii shown in the figure have the values R1 = 10.0 cm, R2 = 20.0 cm, and R3 = 30.0 cm.     (a) Find the total excess charge on the inner and outer surfaces of the conducting sphere. (HINT: You can answer this question qualitatively because the outer sphere is a conducting sphere.)  inner: [qin][qiunits] outer: [qout][qounits] (b) Find the magnitude and direction of the electric field at the following distances r from the center of the inner sphere:  (i) r = 9.5 cm[e95][e95units] (ii) r = 15.0 cm[e15][e15units] (iii) r = 27.0 cm[e27][e27units] (iv) r = 35.0 cm [e35][e35units]

Passage from "Human Ingenuity Takes on Cancer's Darwinian Ways" by George Johnson of the New York Times In cancer, random variation and selection produce a different kind of progeny: clones of mutant cells. As normal cells divide, mutations inevitably occur and spread. The weaker mutants die, leaving the stronger ones to survive. The most aggressive evolve into cancerous tumors, continually devising ways to expand their territory and extend their lives. There are several hypotheses to explain why we can't seek out and destroy these internal miscreants as effectively as those coming from outside. Because cancer arises from our own tissues, the immune system may not recognize a distinction between "self" and "other." Moreover, cancer, unlike infection, usually flourishes later in life. In the cold eyes of evolution, there is little selective advantage to keeping people alive past their reproductive prime. It's left to human wile to find ways of prodding the body into treating cancer as an enemy without destroying healthy tissue.
If we think that low task performance is due to someone's lack of commitment to the team, then we are making an "attribution".

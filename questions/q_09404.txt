A law student has filed an application to the bar and has disclosed two criminal arrests in his past, both relating to public intoxication. The applicant provided detailed records to the bar authorities about the facts and the disposition.  In the first incident, the prosecutor offered the applicant a deferred adjudication if she pled no contest.  In the second incident, the prosecutor offered the applicant deferred adjudication if she entered a plea of no contest and performed 30 hours of community service.  The applicant accepted both pleas and completed the required service.  In the bar application process, the state bar character committee held an informal meeting on the applicant's fitness to practice law.  The applicant appeared with counsel at the meeting and answered all questions truthfully.  At some point during the meeting, the applicant realized that the bar authorities had combined the two incidents into one.  The bar representative said, because the prosecutor chose to give you deferred adjudication in the incident, we approve your application.  Since both incidents ended in deferred adjudication and were similar, the applicant did not correct the bar authorities on their belief there was only one incident.  Was the applicant's decision not to correct the bar authorities consistent with the applicant's duties under the Model Rules?

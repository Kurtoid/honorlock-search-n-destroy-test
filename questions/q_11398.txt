Case study #1 NDM-1 is an enzyme that hydrolyzes and inactivates nearly all known b-lactam-class antibiotics. This enzyme requires a metallic ion, usually zinc, to catalyze the hydrolysis reaction. The gene encoding NDM-1 is found on a conjugative plasmid and is efficiently transferred to many Gram negative bacteria.   Bacteria expressing the ndm-1 gene will be resistant to antibiotics that target which cellular structure?
Passage A Rachel liked the outdoors and she liked the sun. Even when she wasn't swimming on the varsity team, she was often out running, playing volleyball, or just sunbathing. Her friends admired her great tan. That spring, when a teammate noticed that she had a bumpy, black mole on her back, she simply shrugged it off with "l've always had a mole there." Rachel would have ignored it completely, but her swim coach asked her to have it checked by a physician. So she scheduled an appointment with her family doctor, who removed the mole in his office. After the minor surgery, Rachel didn't think about the mole at all. The cut healed in time for the next swim meet, she won the 100-meter butterfly, and she was on top of the world. However, her doctor called back a few days later. Following his general policy, he had sent the tissue to a laboratory for examination. The diagnosis was a type of cancer called melanoma. Melanoma is a skin cancer that usually begins in pigmented cells in the deeper parts of the skin.The resulting disease is challenging to treat and frequently deadly. The American Dermatology Association estimates that more than 54,000 people in the United States will be diagnosed with melanoma this year, with about 8000 deaths. Melanoma is mostly caused by exposure to ultraviolet rays in sunlight. As a child, Rachel had many sunburns. Being badly sunburned as a kid about triples the risk of developing melanoma. Because her melanoma was caught at an early stage, Rachel's prognosis for total recovery is good. You can learn to spot potential melanomas before they become deadly, because virtually all melanomas either begin with a pre-existing mole or begin as a dark spot on the skin that looks like a new mole forming. Recognizing a possible melanoma is as easy as "AB CD": Examine your moles for Asymmetry, irregular Border, irregular Color, or a Diameter larger than the eraser on the end of a pencil. Have any suspicious spots promptly examined by your doctor. -adapted from Audesirk, Audesirk, and Byers, Biology: Life on Earth, pp.191, 217 Passage B The American Psychological Association's code of ethics includes guidelines for using animals in psychological research. Like research with human participants, animal research must follow all relevant federal, state, and local laws. Here are a few of the important guidelines. The use of animals must be supervised by people who are trained in their care. These experienced personnel must teach all subordinates, such as research assistants, how to properly handle and feed the animals and to recognize signs of illness or distress. Researchers are ethically bound to minimize any discomfort to research animals. For example, it is unethical to perform surgery on research animals without appropriate anesthesia. And when researchers must terminate the lives of research animals, they must do so in a humane manner. Even with these safeguards in place, the use of animals in research is controversial. Many animal-rights advocates want all animal research stopped immediately. Thus, it is important to address the question of whether animal research is really necessary. The fact that virtually all of the marvels of modern medicine are at least partially the result of experimentation using animals supports the view that animal research is indeed necessary. Such research has also increased knowledge in the areas of learning, motivation, stress, memory, and effects on the unborn of various drugs ingested during pregnancy. Similarly, animal research has helped psychopharmacologists better understand the side effects of drugs that are used to relieve the symptoms of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Thus animal research is critically important to experiments that involve variables that cannot be ethically manipulated in human beings. However, the material benefits derived from an action cannot stand alone as an ethical justification for it. For this reason, decisions about the use of animals in research must balance the potential benefits of a given study against the pain and suffering that might be inflected upon making an animal fatally ill. By contrast, a study that goes to this extreme in search of a cure for male-pattern baldness might not. Emphasis on achieving this kind of ethical balance in animal research has led to a search for alternative research methods that is reportedly resulting in a decrease in the numbers of animals needed. -adapted from Wood, Wood, and Boy, Mastering the World of Psychology, p.25

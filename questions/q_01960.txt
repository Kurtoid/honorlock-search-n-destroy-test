[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).] The two toy boxcars shown below collide with one another and bounce off of each other in a collision that lasts 0.088 s.  The mass of boxcar 1 is 3.00 kg and the mass of boxcar 2 is 5.00 kg.  Prior to the collision, boxcar 1 is moving to the right at 3.00 m/s.  After the collision, boxcar 1 is moving to the left at 3.33 m/s and boxcar 2 is moving to the right at 1.11 m/s.      a) Draw a diagram of the final state and determine the initial velocity of boxcar 2.  [you will scan and submit this after the quiz] b) Briefly describe how you could determine, numerically, whether the above collision was elastic or inelastic. [enter your description below] c) Determine the impulse caused by Boxcar 2 pushing on Boxcar 1.  [enter the numerical answer below; submit work after quiz] d) Using impulse/momentum principles, determine the magnitude and direction of the force that is exerted on Boxcar 1 by Boxcar 2.  [enter the numerical answer below; submit work after quiz] You will scan your work for parts a, c, and d of this problem and submit it immediately following the quiz.

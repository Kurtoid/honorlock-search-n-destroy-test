A friendly reminder: Final grades in this course will not be curved or rounded up. Any request for additional extra credit or special exceptions to the grading policy, which were described in the syllabus, may be interpreted as an honor code violation (i.e. asking for preferential treatment) and will be handled accordingly. So, please refrain from inquiring. Ultimately, I congratulate you on wrapping up the course... you've done it, and should be proud of this achievement!   P.S. You may rip up your scrap piece of paper on camera now, if you'd like, and expand on your room scan further, before submitting. :]

Describe the joint motion/position of the right/left ankles, right/left knees, and right/left hips of the person shown in this image.  ***Yes, I do realize this person is wearing pants and you cannot perfectly see the knees and hips.  Please use good judgement, common sense, anatomically based predictions, and feel free to explain your answers as needed.*** R Hip: abducted / L Hip: externally rotated R Knee: extended (perhaps slightly flexed) ; L Knee: slightly flexed R Ankle: inverted / L Ankle: slightly dorsiflexed due to slight knee flexion *This was the minimum information necessary for full credit.  More elaborate/detailed answers (e.g., the right hip is also slightly flexed and possibly internally rotated) are A-OK as long as the info is correct.  The biggest error I found in grading this questions was that MANY folks described the right ankle as supinated.  (A) Supination is an action that occurs at the ankle and the foot; (B) Supination involves plantarflexion and that ankle is not even a little plantarflexed...in fact you can see the tendon for tibialis anterior popping out on this gentleman's shin, and that muscle gives dorsiflexion and inversion.  This is a beautifully inverted ankle.  (Important side note: A number of you referenced the tibialis anterior tendon as evidence that the knee was extended.  Please make sure you understand that a muscle will only have an action at a joint if it crosses the joint...and the tibialis anterior does not cross the anterior knee.)   *It is important to evaluate individuals performing movements IN clothes because it is VERY rare that anyone you work with will be wearing a speedo (or the like).  Using visuals like the left toes turned out as a clue that the HIP is externally rotated is a useful tool for your toolkit.

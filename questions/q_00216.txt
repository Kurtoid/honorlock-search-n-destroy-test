1.  (Time Value of Money). (100 points). In the following time value of money problems, unless otherwise indicated, assume that all cash flows are end-of-period and the interest rates given are nominal annual rates: a. Today is your 24th birthday and your mutual fund account balance is $18,000. Your account is earning 6.5% interest compounded semi-annually. How much will be in the account on your 65th birthday? b. Assume that you plan to buy a cabin ten (10) years from today and will need a down payment of $36,000 at such time.  Your rich Uncle Johnny Jays says he will help out by depositing exactly $12,500 into an account today and you can have such amount plus all earned interest at the end of ten years to cover your down payment.  What annual interest rate compounded monthly would the account have to pay in order to ensure you have the exact amount of money you need for your down payment on the cabin? c.  Assume Ron and his wife Julie, two young professionals, just bought a house for $550,000. They made a $55,000 down payment and borrowed the remainder at 3.85% fixed interest compounded monthly for 30 years.  What will be Ron and Julie's monthly house payment on this amortizing loan?  d.  What is the effective annual rate (EAR) of Ron and Julie's home loan described in item c above? e.  Jay and Patty's son Jimbo just turned 8 years old today and they decided to plan for his education and housing costs. Jimbo is expected to start college 10 years from today on his 18th  Jay and Patty want to plan for 4 years of college and estimate it will take $34,000 each year (at the start of each year) for each of the 4 years to pay for the education.  In addition, Jay and Patty plan to buy Jimbo a condo (near campus) at an estimated cost of $105,000 on his 20th birthday (after he moves off campus the beginning of his Junior year).  Jay and Patty plan to deposit $50,000 today (on Jimbo's 8th birthday) in a stock fund that they expect to earn a return of 7.5 percent up until Jimbos 18th Birthday, at which time they plan to sell the stock fund and put all of the proceeds into a college savings account for Jimbo's education and housing costs.  In addition, on each of Jimbo's 9th through 18th birthdays, Jay and Patty expect to annually deposit $10,000 into this same college savings account.  Assuming the college savings account will earn a 5,5% interest rate while Jimbo is in college, what interest rate must the college savings account earn during the next 10 years in order to make the withdrawals necessary from the college savings account to pay for college and housing costs?

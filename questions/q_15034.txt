As you know, last week our test concerned your usage of the Internet. For this test, I want you to write about 1 character from a book, TV show, or movie whom you would like to have as a dinner guest. Which person would you choose, and why? (This person should NOT be a family member or friend. Again, it should be a fictional character from a book, TV series, or movie!)  Consider 2-3 personal traits that you can discuss about him/her. Be sure to explain specific reasons why you would like to have dinner with this character. Is he/she funny? Charitable? Honest? Fashionable? Talented? Brave? Does he/she perform admirable actions in a book, show, or movie? These are just some ideas to consider!  **I suggest that you complete a brief outline before beginning the test just to keep you focused. Your ONE paragraph must include a title. In addition, you must have a minimum of 125 words AND 10-15 sentences. If your paragraph does not meet this length, it canNOT receive a grade other than zero. Try to write in simple sentences to avoid comma splices and run-ons. Pay attention and look out for subject/verb agreement, verb errors in general, and fragments! You have 60 minutes to take this test once it begins, which is comparable to the same time that a face-to-face student has. You can type your paragraph in Word, save, and submit to this assignment.

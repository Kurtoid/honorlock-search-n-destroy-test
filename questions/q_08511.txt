Short Answer: Write 3-5 sentences (one small paragraph). PICK ONLY ONE of the two question groups below (Option #1 or Option #2). Indicate your choice, then answer the questions within that question group. Write complete sentences and use correct grammar. Make sure I can understand what you're saying.

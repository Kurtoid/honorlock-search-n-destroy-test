Explain how polygenic inheritance is more complex than regular inheritance. Name a trait controlled by polygenic inheritance.
Individuals infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) mount protective antibody responses directed against the surface glycoproteins of the virus.  These antibodies are critical to viral clearance, contributing to viral neutralization as well as to complement-mediated and cytotoxic cell-mediated killing of infected target cells.  Surprisingly, humans as well as mice deficient in the complement protein, C3, have greatly reduced antibody responses to T cell-dependent antigens (TD-humoral responses), and are impaired in their ability to control HSV infections.  When C3-deficient mice are infected with HSV, once at day 0 and then a second time 4 weeks later, their antibody response is altered compared to wild-type mice, as shown in Figure 1A.  Describe two stages in B cell activation that are affected by the absence of complement C3 and their role in the decreased antibody response, using the graph to illustrate these stages.

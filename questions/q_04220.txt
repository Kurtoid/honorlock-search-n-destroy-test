Read the following scenario to answer the following question(s).Avian influenza is a viral infection that naturally occurs in wild birds with few damaging effects. However, avian influenza is highly contagious and can quickly kill domesticated birds. Some human influenza viruses are similar to the avian influenza. People infected with avian influenza develop typical flu symptoms (fever, cough, muscle aches). However, symptoms may become more severe and life-threatening. If avian influenza evolves into a form that is easily transmissible from person to person, a global pandemic of widespread human death might occur.Humans that are infected with avian influenza are likely to have elevated levels of ______.
A chemist has a 250 mL volumetric flask containing 0.010 M calcium chloride.  She uses a 50-mL pipet to transfer the solution to a 100-mL volumetric flask and fills it to the water line with water.  What is the mass (in g) of the calcium chloride transferred?  Round your answer to 2 significant figures. (Chapter 4)

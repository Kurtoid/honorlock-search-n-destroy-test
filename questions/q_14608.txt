In an experiment, 50.0 ml of 1.0 M HCl and 50.0 ml of 1.0 M NaOH (both initially at 25.0 C) were mixed in a coffee cup calorimeter. The final temperature of the mixture was measured to be 34.6 C. Calculate Enthalpy of neutralization (DHreaction) per mole of the HCl reacted. Assume that  The heat capacity of the calorimeter Ccal = 0 J/C The specific heat of the solution is 4.184 J/g C. The density of the solution is 1.0 g/ml  (include proper units and the proper sign for Enthalpy of reaction DHreaction)

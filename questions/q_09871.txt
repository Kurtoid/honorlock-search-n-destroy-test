You've reached the last question of the exam. Please DO show the front and back of your scrap paper, if you have one, and tear it up a few times on camera. Now that you're done, if you feel your room scan at the start of the exam was not thorough, revealing your desk, chair, drawers, walls (including the one right in front of you), take a moment to do a final room scan now.

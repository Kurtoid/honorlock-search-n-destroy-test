In this image, you can see that there is a difference in the size of the soma for each motor neuron.  The soma of the motor neuron innervating the type 1 fibers is smallest and the soma of the type 2b fibers is the largest.  Smaller neuronal soma can reach threshold faster because there is less distance for graded potentials to travel to reach the axon hillock--thus, less of the initial potential is lost in decremental flow.  What does this help explain?

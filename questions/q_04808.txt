Karl served a Notice of Termination for Purchaser's Own use (the purchasers are thrilled to move into their first home in this neighbourhood).  The tenant's rent is $1200 per month.  The N12 has a termination date of May 30, 2021.  The closing date of the sale/purchase is June 22, 2021.   The tenant freaked out on receiving the N12.  The tenant's children are still in school until the end of June and they are both in specialized programs that require them to be resident in this particular catchment area.  Also, the school has a specialized daycare that has the ability to administer medication that the tenant's child needs.  This daycare is one of very few that offers this service.  The tenant works within a 5 minute walk of the school so the set up is perfect.  She plans to stay in the rental unit for at least another 3 years until the kids outgrow their middle school.  The tenant flat out told Karl that she isn't moving.  Karl realized that he would need to apply to the LTB for an eviction Order.  He applied in April 2021 but didn't get a hearing date until June 8, 2021.  Karl knows that in these circumstances the tenant has a good argument to stay in the unit.  Karl didn't realize that compensation was payable for a Purchaser's Own use but figured it out before the hearing and e-transferred the tenant the money on June 4, 2021.  She accepted the money so perhaps she is planning to move.  What is the likely outcome at the hearing?

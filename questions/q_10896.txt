PART TWO (25 points)   Levett v. Opal Plasma, Inc. District Court of Capital County, West Carolina               In this case, plaintiff Emma Levett, who suffers from the psychiatric disorder of borderline schizophrenia, has sued defendant Opal Plasma, Inc., a   blood plasma donation center in Capital City, West Carolina.  Levett alleges that Opal has violated the West Carolina Disabilities Act (WCDA), 34 W.C. Rev. Stat. SS 180 et seq., by barring Levett from donating her plasma for money at Opal.   Opal has moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, arguing that its plasma center does not qualify as one of the types of facility that are subject to the requirements of the WCDA.  Levett disagrees and opposes the defendant's motion.                 Levett donated plasma regularly at Opal for several years in order to supplement her income.  However, in 2019, Levett had a moderately severe schizophrenic episode at Opal while donating plasma.  A clinic employee reported that he became concerned that Levett would remove the plasma "draw" needle from her arm and potentially harm herself, or an employee or another donor, with it.  After the report, Opal notified Levett that she was no longer permitted to donate plasma there. The WCDA forbids covered facilities from discriminating against persons with physical or psychological disabilities.  Section 181 of the WCDA contains subsections listing the various kinds of facilities covered by the requirements of the WCDA, which include such facilities as "bakeries," "grocery stores," and "convenience stores."   The parties agree that the only subsection of the statute that potentially covers a plasma donation center is SS 181(B), which provides that "a laundromat, barber shop, beauty shop, office of an accountant or lawyer, pharmacy, hospital, or other service establishment" may not discriminate against disabled persons.  34 W.C. Rev. Stat. SS 181(B).   Levett maintains that Opal's center qualifies as a "service establishment" within the meaning of SS 181(B) because it is an establishment that provides a service to the public - namely, collecting blood plasma donations and paying money for them.   Opal disagrees and argues that a review of the provision as a whole shows that it is only meant to cover facilities where customers pay money to the establishment in return for a service.  But since Opal does not receive payments from customers for a service - rather, it pays visitors for their donated plasma - it is not a "service establishment" within the meaning of 181(B) and thus is not subject to the WCDA's requirements.   The parties' research turned up several other pieces of information that may be relevant:    A passage in the state House Committee Report summarizing the bill that became the WCDA in 1989, stating that "a person alleging discrimination should not have to prove that the service establishment being charged with discrimination is similar to the examples listed in the definition."     A prominent dictionary that defines an "establishment" as "a place of business; a public or private institution such as a school or hospital."     Section 181(B) of the WCDA has been amended once since its passage.  In 1995, the legislature added the words "beauty shop" and "office of an accountant or lawyer" to the list reproduced above.      Instructions:   Please identify and explain three statutory interpretation arguments that the opposing parties could make in this case.  There is no length requirement for this question, but you may find it convenient to devote a paragraph to each argument.  Citing cases (and/or other sources we have read) is always a good addition.   For each argument you discuss, you should (1) identify what the argument is, (2) explain why and how it could apply in this case; and (3) what result in this case the argument would support.     Your answer must also meet the following two requirements:    Make at least one argument on behalf of each party.  (Thus, you can make either two arguments favoring Levett and one favoring Opal, or vice-versa.)     One of your three arguments must directly respond to and try to rebut an argument made by the other party.    Finally, briefly indicate which party you think should prevail in this dispute (should Opal's motion to dismiss be granted or denied?).

Write a JavaFX GUI program with file name LastnameFirstnameExam5.java that meets the following requirements and adheres to the layout included sketch.  Must set the title of the window to be "1331 Exam 5 - YOURNAME", where YOURNAME is replaced with your first and last name. Must include some non-editable text at the top to the window (not the title) with a short phrase of your choosing. Change the text font to either Georgia, Papyrus, Courier New, or Comic Sans MS; it cannot be the default font. Font size should be 12. Must include a plain Button.  The button must toggle the color of the short phrase between Color.BLACK and your favorite color.  Make sure this color is still visible in the UI (i.e. the color should be dark enough to be seen).   Must use the provided image below. We recommend that you use an ImageView to display the image.     WARNING: We will be compiling this from the command line with the image file in the same directory as the source code. If you choose to use an IDE during development, make sure that you place the image in whatever directory will allow it to load by only specifying the filename without any path information. (i.e. you should open the file as "filename.png", not "..filename.png", "/Users/Pictures/filename.png", etc.)   Must include a select one-of-many toggle group to control the alignment of the image displayed. There should be 3 alignment options for Left, Center, and Right.  Hint: StackPane has a setAlignment method. You may place this group beside or below the image.  In order to actually see the alignment change you will need to ensure that your window/stage is large enough. So, you need to set the size of your stage to be large enough to see the change proportional to the the size of your image. A good ratio is to make the window 3 time the width and height of the Image. To do this you can use the following methods: stage.setMinWidth(X); and stage.setMinHeight(Y);   Must use a Spinner UI control that will control the scale of the image.  The Spinner should have a minimum value of 0.1, maximum value of 2.0, initial value of 1.0, and a step amount (i.e. amount to step by) of 0.1 Hint: Make sure to set the scale of both the X and Y dimensions using setScaleX and setScaleY Another Hint: Look closely at Spinner's constructors to find one that allows for configuration of the min/max/init/step values on creation of the Spinner to make your life easier. Yet Another Hint: There are several ways to implement the event handling, we recommend using the setOnMouseClick method that is available to any Node   You must use at least one of the following children of Pane to control the layout of the Nodes: BorderPane, GridPane, HBox, or VBox. You must implement your event handling at least two of the three ways we taught: named inner class, anonymous inner class, and lambda expression.  For example, at least one handler as an anonymous inner class and at least one handler as a lambda expression. Failure to implement handlers in two different ways will result in the loss of points.   Points may be deducted if your layout deviates greatly from the one shown below. However, you do not need to have a border around the pane containing your image nor around the image itself. You may place the one-of-many button group below or beside the Image.  YOUR SHOULD ONLY SUBMIT A SINGLE JAVA FILE. ENSURE THAT ANY OTHER CLASSES YOU INCLUDE EXIST WITHIN THE SAME FILE. IF YOUR SUBMITTED CODE DOES NOT COMPILE, YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO. SAVE, BACKUP, AND TEST OFTEN! The following is an example layout for your UI, but as long as you meet the requirements stated above the layout is flexible:

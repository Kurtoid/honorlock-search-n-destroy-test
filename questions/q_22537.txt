Shelly owns a small company and currently provides customer service in house.  A company offered to handle customer service calls for her.  The company would charge $1,250 per month.

She is only using 12 of the 15 unique numbers that come with her telephone service.  If she outsources customer service and quits using the internal customer service number her telephone bill will not decrease.  What would be the annual effect of outsourcing customer service?

The refracted ray in water makes an angle ph = 72deg angle with the normal, as shown in the figure. The index of refraction of water is 1.33. The angle of incidence is now changed to th = 37deg. What is the new angle of refraction ph in the water? (hint: requires two steps)

He confessed that he had chosen that form by chance. "I might just as well have worked to form sheep into llamas and llamas into sheep. I suppose there is something in the human form that appeals to the artistic turn of mind more powerfully than any animal shape can. But I've not confined myself to man-making.  *** "    "But," said I, "I still do not understand. Where is your justification for inflicting all this pain? The only thing that could excuse vivisection to me would be some application--"    "Precisely," said he. "But, you see, I am differently constituted. We are on different platforms. You are a materialist."    "I am not a materialist," I began hotly.    "In my view--in my view. For it is just this question of pain that parts us. So long as visible or audible pain turns you sick; so long as your own pains drive you; so long as pain underlies your propositions about sin,--so long, I tell you, you are an animal, thinking a little less obscurely what an animal feels. This pain--"    I gave an impatient shrug at such sophistry.    "Oh, but it is such a little thing! A mind truly opened to what science has to teach must see that it is a little thing. It may be that save in this little planet, this speck of cosmic dust, invisible long before the nearest star could be attained--it may be, I say, that nowhere else does this thing called pain occur. But the laws we feel our way towards--Why, even on this earth, even among living things, what pain is there?"    As he spoke he drew a little penknife from his pocket, opened the smaller blade, and moved his chair so that I could see his thigh. Then, choosing the place deliberately, he drove the blade into his leg and withdrew it.

The patient has been prescribed losartan 50mg PO daily.  This medication promotes vasodilation by: Correct Answer: Blocking the action of angiotensin II.     Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB's) block access of angiotensin II to its receptors in blood vessels, the adrenals, and all other tissues.  By blocking the action of angiotensin II, losartan relaxes muscles cells and dilates blood vessels thereby reduces blood pressure.  ARB's decrease release of aldosterone which increases renal excretion of sodium and water.  Sodium and water excretion is further increased through dilation of renal blood vessels.

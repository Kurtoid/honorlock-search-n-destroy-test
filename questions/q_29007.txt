Normally, oxygen crosses the alveoli into the capillaries, tiny blood vessels that lie beside the air sacs; the oxygen is then carried to the rest of the body. But as the immune system wars with the invader, the battle itself disrupts this healthy oxygen transfer. Front-line white blood cells release inflammatory molecules called chemokines, which in turn summon more immune cells that target and kill virus-infected cells, leaving a stew of fluid and dead cells--pus--behind. This is the underlying pathology of pneumonia, with its corresponding symptoms: coughing; fever; and rapid, shallow respiration.  During your innate immunity lecture, we have learned about those first line of white blood cells. Mention the name of those cells here
Which of the following is true of glacial sediments?
Case Study: Darwin's Finches In 1977 the Galapagos had abnormally low rainfall, and the seed plants on which the medium ground finch, Geospiza fortis, depend produced small crops. Only 15% of the population survived the drought, and the survivors were the mostly large birds with strong beaks, because they were able to crack large seeds. The population as a whole was shifted toward larger body size. The level of selection measured in the drought and the drastic population crash was the highest yet recorded in a vertebrate population. However, a few years later there was a particularly wet year, and enormous quantities of seeds were produced. The finches had multiple broods that year, and smaller individuals, having great numbers of small seeds available, and reaching maturity faster, raised more offspring. The effect of the wet year was to shift the average body size back toward smaller size. Similar major fluctuations in climate and food supply occur on approximately a 20-year spacing in the Galapagos as El Nino and La Nina perturbs the local climate, producing dry and wet years. Peter and Rosemary Grant observed the beak size of the Galapagos Finches over a few years. They noted that the average beak size in some years increased and in other years decreased significantly as the availability of large and small seeds changed overtime. What could explain these changes in beak size?

By week two of a 3-day-per-week pulmonary rehabilitation program, a patient with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary dysfunction is performing 15 minutes of cycling exercise with a 1-minute rest period at the 7-minute time-point. The patient's perceived dyspnea rating during cycling exercise was 2. What is the BEST way to progress this patient's exercise program for week three?

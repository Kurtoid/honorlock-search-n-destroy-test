(25 points) In May of 1995, Leona Gray conveys Greenacre by general warranty deed "To Maggie and Ian Webster, a married couple, as tenants by the entirety." The next day, the Websters record the deed. Greenacre is a large, rural property of approximately ten acres with wooded areas and streams. On the far southwest corner, there is a cabin. The Websters do not live there, although they live only about fifteen minutes away. They used to spend weekends at the cabin and enjoy walking in the woods, but they rarely visit now. Because they only occasionally use the property, Ian decides that he should sell Greenacre. Through a friend, he meets Nadia, a conservationist interested in owning a cabin in the woods. She agrees to buy the property. On January 10, 2000, Ian conveys Greenacre by general warranty deed: "I, Ian Webster, grant Nadia Ivanova and her heirs a fee simple absolute in Greenacre." Nadia records the deed that day. On February 1, 2000, Nadia visits the cabin and begins renovating it. Because of her work responsibilities, she can only visit the cabin on the weekends and spend a couple of weeks at the cabin in the summer. She has little time to walk in the woods during these visits. Instead, she spends her time working on the cabin, which occupies about a quarter acre of the ten-acre property. She also lets her friends use the cabin for weekend getaways when she is not there. On March 23, 2001, Ian passes away. Maggie hopes that her daughter, Bonnie, will visit. Knowing that Bonnie enjoys hiking on Greenacre, she grants to Bonnie "the right to fish and walk in the woods on Greenacre." A year later, on March 15, 2002, Maggie passes away, leaving Bonnie as her sole heir. Bonnie assumes that she is now the owner of Greenacre. Several years pass, and Bonnie does not visit Greenacre. Nadia continues to live in the cabin. She also pays the property taxes on Greenacre each year. In September 2013, Bonnie decides that she would like to move home. She decides to visit Greenacre and take a hike in the woods. While on her hike, she encounters Nadia, who is startled to see her. Nadia demands that she leave the property. Bonnie insists that she has a right to be there. Unfortunately, Nadia and Bonnie are unable to resolve the dispute. Bonnie returns home to seek the advice of a lawyer. The statute of limitations for bringing an action to recover an interest in real property is ten years. What property rights, if any, do Bonnie and Nadia have in Greenacre? Identify the possible property interests and explain how each property interest was potentially acquired. Will Nadia have a legal remedy if a court determines that she does not own Greenacre in fee simple?

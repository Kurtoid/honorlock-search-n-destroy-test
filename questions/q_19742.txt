A battery is connected to the capacitor circuit shown below providing a potential difference of 215 V. The capacitor values are all in microfarads.    a) Find the equivalent capacitance for the capacitor circuit. b) How much energy is provided by the battery for the capacitors in this circuit? c) Calculate the charge on the 222 mF capacitor. d) What is the potential difference across the 57 mF cap? e) Calculate the energy stored by the 107 mF capacitor. part a) What is the equivalent capacitance for       7. The figure above shows the circuit simplified with the equivalent values for the original circuit. Simplify the circuit one stage further and enter the values for each letter shown  in the figure below. Round each capacitance to 3 decimal places and do not include units. Be sure to use the values given above.    E = ?

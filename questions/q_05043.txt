The evolutionary track of a Sun-like star is shown below. It contains a dot to indicate the location of the star at a particular point in this evolution. Below this panel are four possible cut-away core diagrams that illustrate the source of fusion energy at different stages of a star's evolution. For the evolutionary points indicated by the dot, indicate with a letter (A, B, C, or D) of the core diagram that correctly illustrates its source of fusion energy.

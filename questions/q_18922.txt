A rock sample from the moon includes a mineral that contains small amounts of the radioactive isotope Potassium-40 and its daughter element Argon-40 (half-life of 1.3 billion years). This mineral would not form with any Argon-40. Consider a crystal with 7 atoms of Argon-40 for every 1 atom of Potassium-40. How many atoms of Potassium-40 were present when the crystal formed for each atom of Potassium-40 that exists today?

You are interested in understanding the gene regulation of LKP1, a protein that is normally produced only in the liver and kidney cells in mice. Interestingly, you find that the lkp1 gene is not expressed in heart cells. You isolate the DNA upstream of the lkp1 gene, place it upstream of the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP), and insert this entire piece of recombinant DNA into mice. You find GFP expressed in liver and kidney cells but not in heart cells, an expression pattern similar to the normal expression of the lkp1 gene. Further experiments demonstrate that there are three regions in the promoter, labeled A, B, and C in the below Figure that contribute to this expression pattern. Assume that a single and unique transcription factor binds each site such that protein X binds site A, protein Y binds site B, and protein Z binds site C. You want to determine which region is responsible for tissue-specific expression, and create mutations in the promoter to determine the function of each of these regions. In the below figure, if the site is missing, it is mutated such that it cannot bind its corresponding transcription factor.  B. In which tissue(s) is factor Z present and bound to the DNA? (select all that apply)

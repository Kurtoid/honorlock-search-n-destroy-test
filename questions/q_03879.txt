QUESTION 8             The flow of the blood around the body is mostly laminar. The speed of the blood in the body is greatest on leaving the heart and at this point turbulent flow can occur.                    8.1   Copy and complete the diagrams to show laminar flow and turbulent flow.   Right click on the button to open the diagram in a new window.      (5)                       A student wishes to estimate the power output P of the heart. He argues that the heart has to pump out blood at a speed v and raise it to a height h above the heart. He proposes the following equation for P.       where Q is the volume of blood passing a point per second and r is the density of the blood.                       8.2   Derive this equation for P using the principle of conservation of energy.   (4)                   8.3   Calculate the power output P of the heart when pumping blood to a height of 0.40 m above the heart. Assume that the speed of the blood has not changed since leaving the heart. r = 1100 kg.m-3   Q = 95 cm3.s-1 v = 0.45 m.s-1   (3)                   8.4   Suggest why, in practice, P will have to be greater than the value calculated in 8.3.   (1)                   8.5   Using the graph state the value for frequency at a wavelength of 2.5 Hz.    (1)                   8.6   Use the value obtained in 8.5 to determine the velocity of that wave.    (2)

A researcher has observed that children who eat more sugar tend to show a higher level of activity than children who eat less sugar.  However, the researcher suspects that the apparent relationship may be explained by the fact that some children have a higher rate of metabolism, which causes them to eat more and to be more active compared to children with a lower rate of metabolism who eat less and are less active.  This is an example of the ____.
Which is an example of negative feedback

Please answer all three parts of this question.  Number the parts in your response.  1.) List ONE RATIONAL cause of the bullwhip effect besides those contributing to inaccurate demand forecasts (i.e. no communication, long lead times, multiple forecasts, etc.).  (Make sure it is a RATIONAL cause, and not an IRRATIONAL cause!) (Note: No credit will be received if stating a cause already listed in this question! Only list ONE cause - if multiple causes are listed, only the first one will be scored.) 2) What is ONE method, or practice, a firm could use to reduce (or "remedy") the bullwhip effect due to the cause you gave in part 1 of this question. Note: Increasing communication or sharing information is NOT a correct answer!  Also, your answer must relate to the cause you mention in part 1 to receive credit. 3) Explain HOW the remedy (i.e. the method or practice that will minimize or reduce the bullwhip effect) you gave in the part 2 will reduce or minimize the bullwhip effect due to the cause you provided in part 1.  It will be helpful to describe the two characteristics of the bullwhip to explain your answers.

Use the table below to answer the following question(s).The Riviera Transport Company (RTC) produces car accessories at two plants: Dallas and Atlanta. They ship them to major distribution centers in Houston, San Jose, Jacksonville, and Memphis. The accounting, production, and marketing departments have provided the information in the table below, which shows the unit cost of shipping between any plant and distribution center, plant capacities over the next planning period, and distribution center demands. RTC's supply chain manager faces the problem of determining how much to ship between each plant and distribution center to minimize the total transportation cost, not exceed available capacity, and meet customer demand.Assume Xij = amount shipped from plant i to distribution center j, where i = 1 represents Dallas, i = 2 represents Atlanta, j = 1 represents Houston, and so on.

Provide a diagnosis (be specific). List symptoms presented that support your diagnosis. Provide recommendations for best treatment(s) and then explain your treatment plan in detail. What should be done to try and prevent relapse?   Bob is a 24 year-old accounting major at a small college. Over the past few weeks his family and friends have noticed increasingly bizarre behaviors. On many occasions they've overheard him whispering in an agitated voice, even though there is no one nearby. Lately, he has refused to answer or make calls on his cell phone, claiming that if he does it will activate a deadly chip that was implanted in his brain by evil aliens. His parents have tried to get him to go with them to a psychiatrist for an evaluation, but he refuses. He has accused them on several occasions of conspiring with the aliens to have him killed so they can remove his brain and put it inside one of their own. He has stopped attended classes altogether. He is now so far behind in his coursework that he will fail if something doesn't change very soon. Although Bob occasionally has a few beers with his friends, he's never been known to abuse alcohol or use drugs. He does, however, have an estranged aunt who has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals over the years due to erratic and bizarre behavior.

In 2007, he swam across the North Pole in water that was so cold his fingers were frozen. Why did Pugh do this? Well, he wants people to pay attention to global warming and the problems it is causing. He decided to swim in water near the North Pole to bring attention to the melting glaciers. Lewis said that the swim was so scary and painful that it was his last time swimming in freezing water. But when he heard about Lake Imja, near Mount Everest, high in the Himalayas, he decided to swim in cold water again.Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world and swimming there is very difficult. It's so high that it's hard to breathe. You feel sick and your head hurts. The first time Lewis tried to swim across Lake Imja, he failed. He usually swims quickly because he wants to get out of the cold water. The first time at Lake Imja, he swam too fast and couldn't breathe. He tried one more time and swam more slowly.

You sample the soil using an open-ended metal cylinder (volume of 196.35 cm3 ). The soil occupies the cylinder from end to end. You return the cylinder to the lab and record the following soil data: moist soil mass + cylinder=  580.43 g oven-dry soil mass + cylinder= 504.34 g cylinder mass (without soil)= 200.00 g   Use the information provided to calculate the following (report results to two decimal places and include units when relevant): a.  the bulk density of the soil.         b.  the gravimetric water content of the moist soil. c.  the volumetric water content of the moist soil. d.  Suppose that the oven-dry soil is retained in the metal cylinder (at the same bulk density as above) and you seal the bottom and set it vertically on your desk. Calculate the maximum amount (ml) of water you can pour slowly into the cylinder before it overflows.

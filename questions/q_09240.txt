Which of the following forms of mechanical ventilation is the most efficacious method for acquired bronchopleural fistulas?
It could be argued that participants in Sherif's (1936) autokinetic effect study converged in their estimates of the amount of movement of a point of light because they were avoiding public embarrassment or social censure from other participants.  Sherif demonstrated that this was unlikely when he found similar results:

A locus in mice is involved in pigment production: when parents heterozygous at this locus are mated, 3/4 of the progeny are colored and 1/4 are albino.  Another locus controls the actual coat color: When two yellow mice are mated 2/3 of the progeny are yellow and 1/3 are agouti (gray). The most complete description for the Mode of Inheritance the action of these 2 loci to yield Albino, Yellow, and Agouti mice is _______________________

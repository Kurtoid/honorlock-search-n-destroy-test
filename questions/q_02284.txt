READ ALL OF THE INSTRUCTIONS: The following exam must be taken through Honorlock (using google chrome). You must show a 360 degree view of your workspace including your ears (to verify you do not have any headphones in).  You may use scratchpaper.  Please tear up paper towards the camera at the end of the exam. You may not have any assistance from any other source/person - doing so would be a violation of the academic integrity code.

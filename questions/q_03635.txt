Fact Narrative: City council's meeting chamber had 63 attendees present and 47 spoke during the public comment period.  People against the subsidy think city government should not use tax dollars to help just one business.  The park will feature 13 new waterslides and will be the largest water park in the state.  In a 5-3 vote, Wichita City Council has voted to subsidize Waterland's water bill by 20%.  The subsidy will be paid from the city's annual budget, which is made up of tax payer dollars.  Waterland is a new water park opening next month in Wichita.   People who support the subsidy say it will help the water park operate and draw thousands of visitors from all over Kansas, which will actually bring even more money to the local economy.  Wichita City Council will save the water park about $1 million per year by lowering its bill 20% each month.  Two members of the public spoke in favor of the water park's water bill subsidy and 45 spoke against it.  The water park will use five million gallons of water each day.    Soundbites:  Patrick Pippin, Wichita Resident and supports the subsidy  "This is about drawing in local businesses that can transform our local economy. Sometimes we have to sweeten the pot to bring business to Kansas." 10 secs "If we give a little up front, we stand to gain a lot more. The water park will bring millions of dollars to our local economy so it is a wise investment." 9 secs "I can't wait to bring my family to Waterland. Finally, we do not have to drive to Denver or Kansas City.  We can stay right here at home." 9 secs  Amanda Gonzalez, Wichita Resident against the subsidy  "The city does not subsidize my water bill. Why would they do this for a big company? Our own citizens are struggling and they are cutting slack to big business."  10 secs "This decision is really a slap in the face to all the hard working people in our community. This is our money that council is now wasting." 10 secs "This is just another example of favoring the big guy over the little guy. It is just a sad thing to see. We are better than this." 7 secs

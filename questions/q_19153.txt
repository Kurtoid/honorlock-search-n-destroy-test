VRAAG 4    'n D&D het dikwels 'n stut in die vorm van 'n rooster. Op elke vierkant kan jy 'n nie-speler karakter (NPC) plaas. Die NPC word gespeel (beheer) deur die Dungeon Master. As die speler se karakter op dieselfde vierkant kom, gebeur daar iets. Maak die DungeonGrid_p in die Question4-leergids oop. Op die vorm is 'n 5x4 rooster wat 'n redelik klein kerker voorstel.      A D&D will often have a prop in the form of a grid. On each square you can place a non-player character (NPC). The NPC is played (controlled) by the Dungeon Master.  When the player's character arrives on the same square something happens.   Open the DungeonGrid_p in the Question4 Folder. On the form is a 5x4 grid representing a rather small dungeon.      Die spel kan in 'n teksleer gestoor word, en elke vierkant word deur 'n karakter voorgestel en deur 'n # geskei. X - is 'n lee vierkant M - is 'n Minotaur NPC U - is 'n Unicorn P1 - is die speler se karakter en die nommer wat volg is die speler se ID. Die teksleer sal so lyk: P2#X#X#X#X# X#M#X#X#X# X#X#X#U#P1# X#X#X#X#X#  In die vorm is twee globale skikkings verklaar. Die een is 'n verskeidenheid dinamiese panele, die ander is 'n 2D-reeks stringe. Die btnLoad is reeds vir jou gekodeer. Dit vul die 2D-skikking met die karakters soos in die teksleer (hoewel nie uit die teksleer nie).      The game could be saved in a text file, each square being represented by a character and separated by a #. X - is an empty square M - is a Minotaur NPC U  - is a Unicorn P1 - is the Player's Character and the number that follows is the player's ID.  The text file would look like this: P2#X#X#X#X# X#M#X#X#X# X#X#X#U#P1# X#X#X#X#X#   In the form, 2 global arrays have been declared. One is an array of dynamic panels the other is a 2D array of strings. The btnLoad has already been coded for you. This fills the 2D array with the characters as in the text file (although not from the text file).     4.1) Die btnDisplayGridClick-prosedure is gedeeltelik gekodeer. Maar die gedeelte wat die paneel se boonste linkerhoek stel, is nie gekodeer nie. Jy moet die kode voltooi. (15)    The btnDisplayGridClick procedure has been partially coded. But the part that sets the panels top left corner has not been coded. You need to complete that code.    4.2) Jy moet die kode vir die bntDisplay skryf, wat die paneelopskrif sal bywerk om die stringe in die 2D-skema te vertoon. Jou kode moet doeltreffend wees en maklik aanpas by enige grootte rooster. Regsklik op die knoppie hieronder om te sien hoe dit moet lyk nadat daar op al drie knoppies gekliek is.  (5)     You need to write the code for the bntDisplay which will update the panels caption to display the strings in the 2D array. Your code should be efficient and easily adapted to any size grid. Right-click on the button below to see what it should look like after all 3 buttons have been clicked.                TOTAAL VIR VRAAG 4 [20]

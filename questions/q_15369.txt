Fact Pattern 1   Jack (he often goes by "Jackie") and Diane meet as seniors in high school in Bloomington, Indiana.  Jackie is captain of the football team, and Diane quickly becomes his main squeeze.   They ride around on Jack's motorcycle and eat chili dogs, particularly from their favorite place, the Tastee Freeze, on the outskirts of town.  After one of their trysts by the river, Diane tells Jack she's pregnant.  Jack and Diane move in together to prepare for their new arrival. Sadly, young love doesn't pan out.  Four years later, Jackie still waxes nostalgic about his football glory days and drinking beer with his buddies until late at the night.  Diane is upset that she spends her days taking care of their young son but that Jack still refuses to marry her.  Diane often reminds him that simply because Jack's name is on their son's birth certificate, that doesn't end his responsibility as a parent. One night after too many Natty Lights (his favorite beer), Jack comes home to their little shared pink house off the interstate to an angry Diane.  They get into another heated argument--and Diane yells louder at Jack not to wake up their son, asleep in his room upstairs.   In his rage, Jack throws a football across the kitchen, barely missing Diane but breaking several dishes as he hurtles several vile expletives in Diane's direction.  Jackie storms out of the house to sleep off his Natty Light. A few days later, after talking it over with her mom and her very close cousin, Diane files a Petition for Domestic Violence Civil Protection Order against Jack, naming herself, their son, Diane's mom and Diane's cousin as protected parties.  After being served with the ex parte Domestic Violence Civil Protection Order, Jack comes to your office for advice.  Jack asks you whether the protected persons under the ex parte DVCPO are appropriate.  Is each protected party correctly included in the DVCPO? Why or why not?(4 points; 200 word limit)   Answer for Diane; the parties' son; Diane's mom; Diane's cousin.

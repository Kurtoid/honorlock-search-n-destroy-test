A new graduate nurse is in the fifth week of working on a busy surgical unit. The nurse  observes some patient care that was "appalling." What should the nurse do?
For fill-in-the-blank questions, each answer is used only once.  Only the best answer will count as the correct answer.   The "contact comfort" observed by Harlow in rhesus monkeys may be especially important for members of the order ______. In other mammalian orders, well-developed locomotor abilities enable infants to maintain proximity with their mother soon after birth (cf. elephants and dolphins) or the infants may be placed in a protected area while the mothers forages (e.g. wolf pups in a den).  However ______are different.  This order has a long evolutionary history of clinging infants who are continuously transported by their mothers as she goes about her everyday activities.  Contact comfort seems to function as a signal to infants that they are safe.  As described by Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, distributed caretaking of infants and young children (by mothers, fathers, grandmothers, siblings, and others) may be a normative feature of rearing immature humans to adulthood. This contrasts with the more exclusive use of ________evident in chimpanzees and other great apes (as well as in the majority of monkey species although there are a few exceptions).    Sarah Blaffer Hrdy concludes that alloparenting transformed reproduction in humans since it allowed prolonged food dependence and _______ maturation in human children. This _______ maturation provides more time for social and cultural learning in humans.      [Note that the same term is used in both blanks]. _______found that the impoverished mothers of Alto do Cruzeiro (in Pernumbuco, Brazil) dealt with high rates of infant mortality by failing to bond with (and showing little maternal care toward) sickly infants. Such infants were perceived to have no desire to live.  The strong bonds that these same women developed with older children demonstrated that they were capable of "mother love" with children who showed that they were survivors.     The Matsigenka of southeastern Peru are a small-scale society (dependent on horticulture and foraging) which emphasizes egalitarian relationships.  The inhabitants of the isolated Samoan islands emphasize respect for family and tribal leaders (they have a more hierarchical social organization).  Despite these differences, as Ochs and Izquierdo noted in their Ethos article, both of these traditional societies expect and get_______ behavior from their children (who carry out utilitarian tasks that benefit others). In their 2009 Ethos article, Ochs & Izquierdo describe the middle-class, dual-income families in their Los Angeles study as ________and suggest that these parents engage in "interventions" that promote dependence in their children. However Ochs & Izquierdo fail to note that Los Angeles working parents are only in contact with their children for a small portion of each weekday.  In contrast, children growing up among the Matsigenka or in Samoa are in constant (24/7) close contact with family members (and have been since birth).  Such children may be more responsive to adult expectations because early continuous contact with familiar caretakers has primed them to pay attention to these individuals.

Your patient is a 45 year old male reporting to the clinic with low back pain.  He states the pain was insidious, with gradual onset and has progressively gotten worse.

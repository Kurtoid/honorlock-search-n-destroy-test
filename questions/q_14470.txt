7)  Fill in blanks with True or False (T or F) for each the following questions relating to vibrational spectroscopy:       [1]  Infrared transmittance is directly proportional to the molar extinction coefficient.       [2]  Raman requires a change in polarizability of the bond to produce an active vibrational mode       [3]  The selection rules for Infrared require a change in bond length to produce an active vibrational mode       [4]  In Raman, the change in energy (or frequency) that is measured is due to elastic scattering of the incident radiation.       [5]  The enhanced signal in Resonance Raman yields high intensity peaks only for functional groups that have a UV-Vis chromophore.      [6]  Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) works best on a nanoparticulate or roughened gold surface due to interaction of the molecules with the surface plasmon.

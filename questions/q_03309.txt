Bonus: Barring the fact that we had to switch the class to (mostly) online due to the pandemic, which I know you didn't sign up for (neither did I :) ), what is at least one thing you liked about the class and at least one thing I could improve about the class.  Keep in mind, I'll be reading these, so keep your answers diplomatic but honest.  I really take these to heart and try to improve the class each semester.  I've enjoyed having each and every one of you.  Thank you for your hard work this semester, especially for hanging in there, given these unusual circumstances!

Compresion de lectura     a   e   i   o   u   n   ?     A   E   I   O   U   N   !     Este es Manolo, lee su descripcion y contesta la pregunta con una oracion completa.      Hola, soy Manolo Reyes. Soy mexicano; naci en Malinalco. Mis padres vinieron aqui de Italia en 1960 y construyeron (built) una casa pequena en el pueblo. Mi padre abrio un restaurante italiano pero luego decidio especializarse en comida Mexicana. Despues de muchos anos, mis padres construyeron una casa mucho mas grande y elegante en el campo. Es alli donde yo vivo con mi esposa, Elena, y mis dos hijos, Samuel y Carmelita. Mi trabajo en el estaurante es muy duro; las horas son larguisimas, pero somos felices aqui. Cuando cocino, me gusta cantar, especialmente opera. Mi especialidad es la cocina mexicana: arroz, frijoles, carne...pero a veces cocino algo diferente, como la tortilla espanola. No uso receta porque la tortilla no es muy complicada: huevos, aceite, cebollas, papas y un poco de sal. Mi amigo Tono cena aqui mucho porque la comida es buena y barata, y a Tono no le gusta cocinar. Ayer le cocine arroz con pollo y se lo servi con una ensalada. A ver (let's see) que pide hoy... En tu opinion, ?que Tono va a pedir hoy?

HISTORY: The patient is an 85-year-old female who lives independently with her husband in their own home. She has been treated for hypothyroidism, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in the past. Medications for these conditions were continued during her hospital stay. Early this morning she awoke with acute onset of right flank pain. Her husband called 9-1-1, and she was brought to the hospital's emergency department. On examination she was found to be in acute pain with a palpable mass in her abdominal area. Radiologic examination found dilated loops of small bowel trapped between the abdominal wall and the ascending colon and cecum. She was admitted and taken emergently to the operating room for a suspected small bowel obstruction. The patient was found to have elevated blood pressure, which was proven to be due to her acute stress reaction about her condition and impending surgery. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The procedure performed was an exploratory laparotomy and release of acute closed loop small bowel obstruction due to adhesions, by lysis of adhesions. Fortunately, the bowel was viable and did not have to be resected.  DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After routine preparation, the patient was taken to the operating room. A midline incision was made through the scar of previous surgery, which was a hysterectomy. Supraumbilical extension of the scar was performed. Once these minor non-obstructing adhesions were taken down the abdominal cavity was entered. One loop of small bowel was almost completely obstructed by den e adhesions. These adhesions were carefully lysed, releasing the small bowel from obstruction. The entire small bowel was mobilized and explored from the ligament of Treitz all the way to the ileocecal valve. The-wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was obtained after lysis of adhesions that released the acute small bowel obstruction. Lap count and instrument count were correct. Seprafilm adhesion barrier substance was placed in the peritoneal cavity prior to closure. The fascia was closed with PDS loop. The skin was closed with a skin stapler. A dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well under general anesthesia and was taken to the post-anesthesia recovery area in good condition.

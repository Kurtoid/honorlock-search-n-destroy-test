BONUS (5 points)Does treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function following a heart attack?  The table below provides summary statistics for an experiment to test ESCs in sheep that had a heart attack.  Each of these sheep was randomly assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts' pumping capacity was measured in the study.  A positive value corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which generally suggests a stronger recovery.     n x - bar s   ESCs 9 3.50 5.17   control 9 -4.33 2.76    The point estimate for the difference is 7.83 and standard error is computed at 1.95. Find and interpret the p-value for a one-sided test for evidence that ESC improves heart function.  Show your work to receive full extra credit.

Submarine Hulls (Canvas Q16~21, Handwritten Q16/19) The outside hulls of submarines are constructed with special alloys (homogeneous mixtures) of metals that are especially pressure-resistant. The depth rating of a submarine depends on the specific alloy used to construct its hull. One example of such an alloy is HY-80, a special type of steel that contains nickel, chromium, molybdenum, and manganese. This alloy is specially designed to resist permanent bending caused by high pressure differences (such as The Great Crunchening of the soda can from our demo before Lab 7).  A materials engineer is testing a new form of HY-80 for the pressure it collapses at, and finds that deformation occurs at 8[p1].[p2] kpsi (kilo-psi). What is this pressure expressed in megapascals?

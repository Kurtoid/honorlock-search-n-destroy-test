The Task Company is to begin operations in April. It has budgeted April sales of $30,000, May sales of $34,000, June sales of $40,000, July sales of $42,000, and August sales of $38,000. Note that 10% of each month's sales will represent cash sales (i.e., collected immediately); 75% of the balance (i.e. 75 % of credit sales) will be collected in the month following the sale, 17% the second month, 6% the third month, and the balance is bad debts. What is the amount of cash to be collected in the month of August?
"Remember the speeches we have spoken so often over our mead, when we raised boast on the bench, heroes in the hall, about hard fighting. Now may the man that is bold prove that he is. . . . To me that is greatest of griefs: he was both my kinsman and my lord."

Using the following lines of code, build a function called product_sum() which accepts two vectors of int values (named 'x' and 'y') as arguments, multiplies each element of 'x' with every element of 'y', sums the products, and collects the sums into a new vector, which is finally returned by the function. For example, if the two vectors were ... vector x = {1, 2, 3};vector y = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; ... then the resulting vector from product_sum() would contain the following elements: {15, 30, 45} Complete the function by selecting the appropriate lines of code: [x3] product_sum(vector& x, vector& y) {     vector results;     int product;    int total;    for (int i = 0; i < [x6]; ++i) {        [x2]        for (int j = 0; j < [x8]; ++j) {            [x1]            [x5]        }        [x4]    }    return [x7];} (NOTE: Not all of the lines of code provided in the drop-down lists will be used in this function!)

Which of the following correctly map the subdivision of the cerebellum to the output nuclei? Select all that apply.
The image below shows the initial volume (mL) of a titrant just prior to the start of a titration. The identiy of the tirant is NaOH (aq) at a concentration of 1.0910 M. Assume that the analyte of the titration is 10.256 mL of acetic acid.  Report your answer to each question or problem below. Make sure you reference your answers by numbering them according to the question or problem. You do not need to show calculations. 1. A student incorrectly records the initial volume as 20.9 mL. Explain why this measurement is incorrect. (1 pt) 2. Using the maximum precision available, report the value of the initial volume of titrant along with its correct unit(s) of measure. (2 pts) 3. What is the name of the device that is most likely shown in the image? (1 pt) 4. Choose a final volume for the titration that is somewhere between 31.2 mL and 30.5 mL and record this number to the same precision available as the initial volume in Question 1. Use this value to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid sample prior to titration. Show all calculations. (6 pt)
When delivering a speech, Tom forgot to cite his research source aloud. Which is true?
This is a two-part question. Assume that a country produces an output Q of 50 every year and that r* = 10%. Consumption C is 50 every year, and I = G = 0. Suppose there is a temporary drop in output in year 0, so output falls to 28. Q returns to 50 in every future year. If the country desires to smooth consumption, how much should it borrow in period 0? What will the new level of C from then on? (Hint: calculate the new present value of Q and then estimate the new constant level of C.

The solutions in the arms of a U-tube are separated at the bottom of the tube by a selectively permeable membrane. The membrane is permeable to sodium chloride but not to glucose. Side A is filled with a solution of 0.4 M glucose and 0.5 M sodium chloride (NaCl), and side B is filled with a solution containing 0.8 M glucose and 0.4 M sodium chloride.  Initially, the volume in both arms is the same.  After 48 hours, you will find that side A

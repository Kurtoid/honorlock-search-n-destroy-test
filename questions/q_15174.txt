Use the scenario below to answer the following two questions.   The BCA assay is commonly used to determine the total protein concentration in a sample when compared to a protein reference standard. Assay samples containing protein change color from a pale green (little or no protein present) to purple (protein present) upon incubation. The purple coloration, which is directly proportional to the amount of protein present, has a maximum absorbance at 562 nm, so it can be measured on a spectrophotometer.  Your supervisor would like you to use the data provided below to plot the concentration vs. absorbance and generate a standard curve for the protein reference standard Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), to be included in the BCA assay your supervisor has asked you to perform.     BSA Conc. mg/mL Absorbance (at 562 nm)   0.0 0.0   1.0 3.3   2.5 4.9   5.0 10.2   7.5 15.1   10.0 20.3

A friend is asking you for advice on how they should manage their household waste. They live in a house that generates 20 tons per year and it is made of 50% mixed recyclables and 50% mixed MSW. If they were to recycle the 10 tons per year instead of landfill it, what is their net MTCO2E savings per year (if any)? Use WARM table.  Note, there is a similar problem with different scenario but same assumptions. A net savings should be entered as a negative number.  A net production should be entered as a positive number.

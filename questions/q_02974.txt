A 7.5 mH{"version":"1.1","math":"7.5 mH"} inductor, a 52 mF{"version":"1.1","math":"52 mF"} capacitor and a 1.5 O{"version":"1.1","math":"1.5 O"} resistor are connected in series across an AC source with a fixed rms voltage of 2.4 V and a variable frequency.  As the frequency varies, the rms current Irms{"version":"1.1","math":"Irms"} varies.  What is the largest value of the rms current,  Irms{"version":"1.1","math":"Irms"}?
Use the following vignette to answer 34 - 35. Linda, a 52 y.o. woman, visits your office for follow-up. She was diagnosed with diabetes about 10 years ago. Until now, she has been treated with metformin 1000 mg/day. Her vitals are 137/85 mmHg BP, 76 BPM HR, and 14 breath/min RR. BMI is 29.

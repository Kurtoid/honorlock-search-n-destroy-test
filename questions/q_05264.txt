It is known that there are two routes from origin to destination. Route 1 has a 60 mi/h speed limit and is 5 miles in length; route 2 is 3.5 miles in length with a 30 mi/h speed limit. Studies show that the total travel time on route 1 increases three minutes for every additional 1,000 vehicles added. Minutes of travel time on route 2 increase one minute for every additional 1,000 vehicles added. Total origin-destination demand is 7000 vehicles in the peak hour. a. What are user equilibrium route flows [v1] veh/hr, [v2] veh/hr, and Total Travel Times=[v3] veh-min . b. What are system optimal route flows [v4] veh/hr, [v5] veh/hr, and Total Travel Times=[v6] veh-min .

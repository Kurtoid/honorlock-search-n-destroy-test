If mortgage rates decline significantly, borrowers may decide to prepay the principal on their loan even if they face prepayment penalties. One way that lenders protect themselves from prepayments in such circumstances is by requiring the borrower who prepays to purchase for the lender a set of U.S. Treasury securities whose coupon payments replicate the cash flows the lender will lose as a result of the early retirement of the mortgage. This process is referred to as:

For your final examination, you should write a cohesive, well-developed essay that fully addresses the essay prompt. Please closely read the following CQ Researcher articles (published September 24, 2010 (volume 20, issue 33)) and then the prompt below.     "Impact of the Internet-Is the Internet Making Students Smarter: Pro"by Cathleen Norris, Professor of Learning Technologies at the University of North Texas   "Impact of the Internet-Is the Internet Making Students Smarter: Con"by Elias Aboujaoude, Psychiatrist and Researcher at Stanford University     par. 1The Internet is just a roadway. But with mobile devices in the palms of their hands, all children, rich or poor, can hop onto that roadway to explore their ideas, collaborate with friends and establish new contacts. For a youth living below the poverty line in Detroit, an Internet-connected smartphone is arguably the most empowering opportunity in that child's life. par. 2Of course, we adults must provide instruction and guidance to help children make the best use of this truly unique opportunity. Although the temptations to squander the opportunity are but a finger-tap away, we are seeing that with proper adult support children can and do make effective use of their Internet-connected smartphones. As a young African-American girl commented to a CNN interviewer in describing her fifth-grade lesson on the Revolutionary War, "Now I can do something interesting with my phone, not just text." par. 3The Internet naysayers say the Web encourages shallowness in thinking. But, in the context of the level of engagement that an Internet-connected smartphone affords and engenders, the naysayers' comments are mere quibbles. Paper, pencils, textbooks, blackboards--the stuff of America's classrooms--simply do not engage today's "mobile generation." For better or worse, this generation needs the interactivity and feedback provided by Internet-connected mobile devices. par. 4In classrooms from Singapore to the U.K. to Toms River, N.J., where students use such devices as essential tools for learning for 40 to 70 percent of the school day--plus time on the school bus or in the bleachers at their brother's soccer match--understanding is improving, and so are test scores. "All 150 students in the project did every lick of homework--on time," says Mike Citta, principal of Hooper Avenue Elementary School in Toms River. par. 5There is no magic in these devices; test scores improve because the students are spending more time on task because they are more engaged in their studies when using curriculum that is based on Internet-connected mobile devices. par. 6There is no going back. Within five years every child in every grade in every school in America will be using mobile learning devices 24/7. And watch the test scores skyrocket!   par. 1Much has been said about how digital media are changing the way we write. Not surprisingly, reading is also changing. Eye-tracking experiments suggest that online reading does not progress in a "logical" way but unfolds like a giant-font letter "F" superimposed on the page. Users read in a horizontal movement across the upper part; move toward the bottom and read across in a second horizontal movement; then scan the left side in a quick vertical glance. Online reading seems just as foreign as online writing. par. 2We scan and forage, rather than read, in part because of significant competition from other Web pages. Much of learning starts with a teacher imploring students to "pay attention." Yet many kids seem unable to focus for longer than it takes to write a status update. par. 3Studies of students suggest a link between attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Internet use. For example, in a study involving 216 college students, 32 percent of Internet "addicts" had ADHD, compared to only 8 percent of normal users. While this does not prove causality, it suggests that our virtual lifestyle may be making us crave Ritalin, the drug used to control ADHD. par. 4Another cornerstone of cognition is memory: What good are reading, writing and attentiveness without retention? But more students are asking: Why bother to remember when all information is at our fingertips and when a Gmail account arrives with 7 gigabytes of storage? Memorizing has become a lost art as we have moved from cramming our brains to cramming our hard drives. par. 5Where does this leave us? Because information is power, we feel empowered, but this is deceptive if we are gradually becoming less smart. Our ability to focus is compromised, which is one reason we love Twitter. But Twitter, in turn, further compromises our mental processing power, making us crave even speedier, less complex tools. par. 6This cycle, and this dumbing-down, may prove counter-democratic. While the great equalizing effect of the Internet wipes out differences, instead of enhancing democracy, it may be moving us toward demagoguery. Demagogues' half-truths and propaganda require probing, dissection and debate, but one is too distracted. One just got tweeted.     _____________________________________________________________________________________ Topic: Using the above-noted articles, "Impact of the Internet-Is the Internet Making Students Smarter: Pro" and "Impact of the Internet-Is the Internet Making Students Smarter: Con," as reference sources, write an essay in which you analyze each author's use of one rhetorical tool or rhetorical appeal to achieve his or her specific purpose.  To start, determine what you believe is each author's specific purpose.

Imagine you had accidentally hit your head and you are having a short-term memory loss. You forgot everything you know and every experience you had, except for your knowledge of the scientific method. You choose to re-discover things:   A) You step outside, and you see that it is windy, and a leaf falls next to you. You pick it up, and let it go, the wind blows and the leaf falls to the ground, again. Your curiosity kicks in, and you wonder if other things would fall down too. You pick up a pebble, and let it go. You try with other objects too, and notice the outcome. At this point, you are confident about your observations, and ready to write a statement about it.  B) Then, you wonder about the reason why things behave the way you observed when you let them go from a height. You remember that it was a windy day. Your mind naturally makes a connection, and you make an educated guess.  C) You now have the responsibility to confirm your hypothesis, and you think about a way to test it. You carry out your plan, and note what happens during your experiment. D) The results of your experiment may or may not confirm your hypothesis.  Based on that, you conclude what you can do next.    Your assignment now is to write a description of your day, based on everything you experienced and did. This is your day, so write about it the way you want to write about it. There are some keywords that must be used to explain your actions: A) law B) hypothesis C) experiment D) theory Be as descriptive as possible, but do not exceed 300 words. Someone reading your "report" should understand your motivation, and be able to repeat your experiment exactly and obtain the same results.

11. Describe the principle of operation of pyroelectric meter.                                         12. Draw the Fresnel reflections produced by a positive lens. From which surface (1st, 2nd) the reflections present an eye hazard and why?                                         13. An atom, making a downward transition from the 4th to the 2nd energy level, releases a photon. Determine the (a) energy (J), (b) frequency, (c) wavelength, and (d) wavenumber for this photon.                                         14. Determine the values of the amplitude reflection/transmission coefficients for light incident at 300 on an air-glass interface (ng=1.50).                                       15. What percentage of the incoming irradiance is reflected/transmitted at normal incidence on an air-flint glass (1.66) interface?                                       16. The output power of an argon laser operating at a wavelength of 700 nm is measured by a photoelectric power meter with a detector 150 mm in diameter. Figure 1 illustrates the meter calibration curve. The calculated irradiance is 577 mW/cm2. Determine the power of the laser.

1.  Solve the following arithmetic problems.  Remember to show ALL work for this problem and and EVERY problem on this exam. a)  Determine the unsigned hexadecimal, octal, binary, and BCD representations of the number 43710.  (I strongly recommend that you check your work before moving on to the next problem.)  Use scratch paper for this and ALL problems on this exam.  Remember to show ALL work for this problem and EVERY problem on this exam. Label each problem with the problem number, e.g., for this problem use  1. a) Do not put ANYTHING in the box at the bottom of this problem (and similar boxes at the bottom of each of the problems).  b)  Determine the 10-bit signed magnitude, 1's complement, and 2's complement representations of the decimal number -43710.  (I strongly recommend that you check your work before moving on to the next problem.)   c)  What is 48010 - 43710 in 10-bit 2's complement? You must use binary numbers to derive and determine the solution (not decimal).  Hint: 480 = 28+27+26+25 You must show all work.   d)  What is 38410 - 43710 in10-bit 2's complement?

Let's say you wanted to understand the role of habitat loss versus fragmentation on the Florida scrub lizard in central Florida. To do so, you acquire a categorical map of scrub patches in the central Florida region. With this map, you randomly select scrub patches to survey (using pitfall traps) for the presence or absence of scrub lizards before and after some urban development occurs that causes a reduction in scrub habitat. You will need to interpret how variation landscape structure may influence the presence or absence of scrub lizards in the patches that you sampled. Let's say you also measured some aspects of scrub vegetation, such as scrub height, to better understand variation in presence / absence of lizards. You are interested in using these data to make a predictive map of the distribution of lizards in this region, based on a statistical model of your presence/absence data and potential associations with habitat loss and fragmentation.  Such a model would be described as a [options] model.

Aerospace Manufacturing (Canvas Q16~22, Handwritten Pages Q16/19/20) Titanium is a very versatile metal, finding many uses in various forms in mechanical engineering. Building safe and long-lasting aircraft and spacecraft requires specialized materials that are strong and resistant to corrosion, yet relatively lightweight. Titanium alloys fit these requirements nicely, and are very widely used in the aerospace industry as a result; one type of titanium alloy, Ti-6Al-4V, makes up about 50% of all metal alloys used in airplanes! In order to make pure titanium metal, it must first be extracted from titanium-containing ores. The most important titanium ore, ilmenite (FeTiO3), is processed via reaction with chlorine gas as shown below. 2 FeTiO3 (s) + 7 Cl2 (g) + 6 C (s,graphite) - 2 TiCl4 (l) + 2 FeCl3 (s) + 6 CO (g)                    DHdeg = ? The standard enthalpy of formation of solid ilmenite is estimated to be DHdegf(FeTiO3) = -295.[a] kcal/mol. Calculate the standard enthalpy of reaction for the above reaction as written, in units of kilojoules.

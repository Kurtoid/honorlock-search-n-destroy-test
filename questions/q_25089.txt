Vraag 7 [6 Punte] Scenario: Die DBV gaan in April 'n hondeskou aanbied om fondse in te samel. Die plaaslike kwekery stel hulle gronde en koffiewinkel beskikbaar om te gebruik om die hondeskou by te hou. Jou ma wat op die komitee is, vra jou om te help. Hulle wil 'n klein inligtingsentrum inrig by die kwekery se koffiewinkel. Daar moet 'n klein netwerk wees wat met 'n drukker gekoppel is en Internettoegang sal ook verskaf word. Die beoordelaars sal tablette gebruik en daar sal 1 tafelrekenaar en een drukker wees.         7.1   Watter apparatuurtoestel kan gebruik kan word om data teen kragonderbrekings te beskerm indien Eskom beurtkrag sou instel?   (1)     7.2   Jy stel voor dat die beoordelaars gebruik maak van aanlyn-stoor     7.2.1   Gee EEN voordeel van 'n aanlyn-stoor   (1)     7.2.2   As aanlyn-stoor gebruik word, moet gebruikers hulle leers sinkroniseer (sync). Verduidelik kortliks wat met die term sinkronisasie (syncing) bedoel word.   (1)         Een van die beoordelaars gaan 'n ultrabook gebruik. 'n Ultrabook gebruik 'n SSD en nie 'n gewone hardeskyf as stoormedium.     7.3   Gee TWEE voordele van SSD's in vergelyking met gewone hardeskywe.

While studying a particular chemical reaction observed in a cell, a scientist notes that four substances are involved (Substance A, Substance B, Substance C, Substance D) and suspects that one is an enzyme, one a substrate, one the product of the reaction, and one an inhibitor. Under normal conditions as the reaction occurs the concentration of Substance A decreases and the concentration of Substance C increases. The scientist tests the reaction by artificially increasing the initial concentration of each substance in separate trials. The results show that when Substance A is added that Substance C has a higher final concentration than normal. When Substance B is added the reaction proceeds at a higher rate. When Substance C is added, all other substances are react like normal. When Substance D is added, the final concentration of Substance A is higher than normal and the final concentration of Substance C is lower than normal. Check all responses below that are true in this scenario.

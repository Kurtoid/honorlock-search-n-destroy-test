Real world question: Tourists often hear about the wonderful, warm Florida weather; they live in blissful ignorance of the freezes experienced in the northern parts of the state. A tourism organization wants to open up the entire state to tourists. They know that not everyone is drawn to hot, sunny beaches, so they want to advertise the advantages of visiting other parts of the state. One of the first things they need to do is educate potential tourists about the weather. And part of that involves informing them about the average rainfall across the state. Your task is to help the tourism organization figure out what the average Florida rainfall is like. Rainfall data is provided below. The table below gives the typical yearly rainfall in some parts of Florida.

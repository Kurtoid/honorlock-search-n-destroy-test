ESSAY OPTION #1: Over the past year, COVID has had a far reaching impact around the world, and here at home. First and foremost in managing/mitigating/leading through the public health crisis. Secondly, COVID served to disrupt economies around the world. Finally, we have all been asked to minimize the spread via physical distancing and dramatically changing our way of living for several months. In thinking through these challenges, I'd be interested in gaining your perspective on how EQ could have been used to help us navigate through this crisis. Using the scenario below, provide the following with depth, clarity and vivid storytelling. Scenario:  Imagine you are 3 years into your Post-UF career in the summer of 2020. Your company started a round of layoffs last month, but thankfully you were not part of this 1st wave. While you feel fortunate to still have your job, your team is smaller, the challenges are greater, and everyone is feeling the increased stress and anxiety of the uncertainty of the future. This includes your peer group and even your boss. You are undoubtedly feeling it too, both at work and at home. How might you utilize EQ given these circumstances to best support your boss, your team, your clients, your career aspirations and yourself. Is there a pathway to allow EQ to enable you to stand out and thrive during this difficult time?             To get full credit, be creative/detailed with your scenario. MAKE IT REAL/APPLIED   Define the company and your role Define (2) specific challenges this situation has presented  One challenge should be related to how you are handling this (self) One challenge should be related to how you are handling this with other key stakeholders (others - ex: boss, peers, clients, etc.)   Identify (3) specific competencies you can use to help you manage both of the challenging situations you have defined (should be unique for each challenge).  Outline, in detail, how these competencies will create a powerful solution to address the challenges you have outlined   "Connect the dots" to other MAN 4930 content where relevant to create a complete answer. Please underline or bold the concept when you 1st refer to it.    =========================================================================  ESSAY OPTION #2: You are ten years into your career, and you have been asked to take over a struggling division in your company, where you have worked for the past six years. This is a huge opportunity to establish yourself as a Transformational Leader in the eyes of the CEO.  In doing your research about this division, you have identified the following challenges:  The team has been neglected by an Impoverished Leader for the past two years. Prior to that, the team was managed by a 9,2 Authoritarian Leader. There are both internal and external environmental influences at play that have, in part, have led to a 20% drop in sales over the past 12 months. The SVP of the company (your boss) is new to the company, and has a strong reputation within the industry. You've seen her impressive results, and heard things from others who have worked with her, but you have no direct knowledge of how to best partner with her to achieve results. The Board is putting tremendous pressure on the CEO to turn around this division within the next two quarters. Results are expected to come quickly.  You're a High EQ Leader, and you've used EQ to build strong expert/referent power in the past. You also aspire to be a Transformational Leader, incorporating the 4 I's into your day to day leading of others. You elect to rely on Transformational Leadership as the backbone of your turnaround plan. To get full credit, be creative/detailed w/ the scenario. MAKE IT REAL/APPLIED:  Outline the company, your title and the division you are taking over.   Identify (2) specific Transformational Leadership strategies (using the 4 I's and the specific competencies within the 4 I's) you will deploy to deliver premier results for EACH of the following stakeholders:  Strategy #1 - Your Team Strategy #2 - Customers (current and new)     Your strategies must "connect the dots" - with each strategy incorporating at least (2-3) Transformational Leadership competencies - to drive a specific KPI or outcome. For each strategy, I'd expect to see multiple competencies at play and defined specifically, not simply referencing a TL competency and moving on.     Each strategy is a mini story:   What is the issue/challenge, what is the Transformational Leadership strategy you will use, why will this strategy effectively address the issue/challenge, what is the result (KPI/outcome)     Incorporate at least (2) other MAN 4930 concepts into your analysis/answer (a quick reference to them is fine as it relates to your TL solution). Please underline or bold the concept when you 1st refer to it.

Assume that the pKa of the a-COOH for both amino acids is 1.8, and that the pKa of the a-NH3+ group for both amino acids is 9.0. For each amino acid, list the charges in order from pH 3 (left) to pH 13 (right), separated by commas (for example: +2, 0, -1).  Blank #1: Glu charges at each pH value listed in the table below Blank #2: Tyr charges at each pH value listed in the table below  Blank #3: Is Glu an effective buffer at pH 4? (yes/no) Blank #4: Is Tyr an effective buffer at pH 4? (yes/no)

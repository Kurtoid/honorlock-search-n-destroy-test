Interior Products, Inc. is evaluating the purchase of a new machine to use in its manufacturing process. The new machine would cost $37,000 and have a useful life of 5 years. At the end of the machine's life, it would have a residual value of $2600. Annual cost savings from the new machine would be $12,200 per year for each of the five years of its life. Interior Products, Inc. has a minimum required rate of return of 16% on all new projects. The net present value of the new machine would be closest to: (Round any intermediary calculations and your final answer to the nearest dollar.)Present Value of $1    Periods 14% 16% 18%   5 0.519 0.476 0.437   6 0.456 0.410 0.370   7 0.400 0.354 0.314    Present Value of Annuity of $1    Periods 14% 16% 18%   5 3.433 3.274 3.127   6 3.889 3.685 3.498   7 4.288 4.039 3.812

Given the following diagram of a heap using block headers with both p-bits and a-bits and requiring double-word alignment: If p9 was last allocation and best-fit placement policy with splitting and immediate coalescing is used, what is the value of the payload pointer (address) returned to p11 after the execution of: free(p4);free(p1);p11 = malloc(3*sizeof(int)); Use the same format for your answer as shown in the diagram above "size/bits" without any spaces and no quotes.

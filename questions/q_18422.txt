Your client, the financial firm Dynamic LLC, is an Oklahoma corporation headquartered in Oklahoma City. Last year Dynamic entered into a contract with Pete, a Texas citizen, to rebuild and expand the building where Dynamic keeps its computer servers. Pete spent several weeks on site at Dynamic's Oklahoma headquarters working on the building. However, Dynamic subsequently concluded that the work was not performed to the contract's specifications, and refused to pay Pete the contractual price of $150,000 for his work. Pete has just filed a $150,000 state law claim for breach of contract against Dynamic in federal district court. When Pete was visiting the Dynamic headquarters in Oklahoma, he inadvertently backed his work truck into a security guard booth near the entrance, seriously damaging the booth. Thus, Dynamic is considering filing a state law negligence claim against Pete for the damage to its booth. Dynamic would seek $50,000 in damages on this claim.Dynamic has two questions for you: (a) If Dynamic wishes, would it be allowed to file this negligence claim in Pete's federal court action? Consider both the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and jurisdictional issues. (b) Alternatively, what would happen if Dynamic waits until this lawsuit is over and (assuming the statute of limitations has not expired) files its claim against Pete as a separate lawsuit in a state court in Oklahoma?

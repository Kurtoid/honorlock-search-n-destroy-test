Which of the following statements is true of the McNary-Haugen bill?
2. Cross Validation (12 points) Imagine that we want to train a neural network using back-propagation. In order to determine the amount of training, a simple validation technique is employed. Specifically, we randomly split the available samples into two equal-sized parts, one for training and one for validation. (a) Describe the qualitative behavior of the network on the training and validation sets. If the x-axis the number of training iterations and the y-axis the error, this single graph should have two curves, one for the error on the validation set and one on the training set. Describe the features of the curves. Now imagine that you suddenly have ten times as much data as you had before but you are using the same network structure and learning algorithm: (b) Would you expect the training curve to be different? If so, describe the difference between the old and the new curves, and explain your reasoning. (c) Would you expect the validation curve to be different? If so, describe the difference between the old and the new curves, and explain your reasoning. Clearly mark your answers with (a), (b) or (c).
You have files Parent.java, Child.java, and a driver class named Driver.java. Fill in the correct visibility modifiers so that the comments in the class Child and Driver's main method are upheld.  public class Parent {    1  void method1() { /*compiles*/ }    2  void method2() { /*compiles*/ }    3  void method3() { /*compiles*/ } }  ----- in a separate file in a different package/directory ----- public class Child extends Parent {   public void foo() { method2(); // compiles method3(); // doesn't compile }}  ----- in a separate file in a different package/directory ----- public class Driver { public static void main(String[] args) { Child c = new Child(); c.method1(); // compiles c.method2(); // doesn't compile c.method3(); // doesn't compile }}    1   : [1]  2   : [2]  3   : [3]

Jake used to work as a high school teacher for $40,000 per year but quit in order to start his own painting business. To invest in his painting business, he withdrew $20,000 from his savings, which paid 3 percent interest, and borrowed $30,000 from his uncle, whom he pays 3 percent interest per year. Last year Jake paid $25,000 for supplies and had revenue of $60,000. Walter asked Tyler the accountant and Greg the economist to calculate his painting business's profit

The empirical formula of the reduced form of lactobionic acid, a sugar used in some medicinal agents, is CH2O.  The molar mass of this compound is 360 g/mol. What is its molecular formula?
A type of research that examines relationships between two variables is known as __________________.
True or False:  Consider the time series Yt=2t+St+Zt, where St is the weekly seasonal component with m=7, and Zt is the white noise. We don't need to do both trend and seasonal differencing (1-B)(1-B^7)Yt to reach stationary, just the seasonal differencing( 1-B^7)Yt would reach stationary. (Hint: assume St=St-m, apply the differencing on the equation of Yt then expand it. )

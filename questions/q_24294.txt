Use the following map to answer the questions that follow. Canvas will randomly select three of the five numbered station models.

Each station model is worth 4 points. Note: You only need to answer this for the ONE station model per question listed below the map in BLUE. You will get three questions in a row that ask you for information for three different randomly-selected station numbers. If this is the first one you have seen, you will see two more stations in the next two questions. If this is the second one you have seen, you will see one more station in the next question. If this is the third one you have seen, this will be the last one; you do not have to answer this for every station labeled with a number.    Indicate the following observations for Location / Station Model 2: Temperature, Dew Point, Pressure, Wind Direction and Speed, and Cloud Cover Be sure to indicate which answer is which variable in your answer and don't forget to label units!

The seismic break with the Catholic Church in England occurred in the 1530s, when Henry VIII established a new, Protestant state religion. A devout Catholic, Henry had initially stood in opposition to the Reformation. Pope Leo X even awarded him the title "Defender of the Faith." The tides turned, however, when Henry desired a male heir to the Tudor monarchy.

His third wife, Jane Seymour, at long last delivered a son, Edward, who ruled for only a short time before dying in 1553 at the age of fifteen. Mary, the daughter of Henry VIII and his discarded first wife Catherine, then came to the throne, committed to restoring Catholicism.

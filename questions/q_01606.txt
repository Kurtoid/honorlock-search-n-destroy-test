Points from this section will be added when I hand grade this section and the essay questions. Michael was a pleasant, happy infant who seemed to be developing normally until about six months of age. Able to roll over and sit for a few seconds, suddenly he seemed to lose those abilities. Soon, he no longer turned and smiled at his mother's voice, as he had before, and he did not seem as interested in his mobile as he once was. Concerned about Michael's reversals in development, his anxious parents took him to the doctor. It took exams by several specialists to diagnose Michael's Tay-Sachs disease, because, thanks to screening programs in the population groups known to have this inherited illness, fewer than ten new cases appear each year. Michael's parents were not among those ethnic groups and previously had no idea that they both were carriers of the gene that causes this very rare illness. A neurologist clinched her suspicion of Tay-Sachs by looking into Michael's eyes, where she saw the telltale cherry red spot indicating the illness. A look at his cells provided further clues as _____________________________   (type of organelle that is a membranous sac with hydrolytic enzymes) were swollen to huge proportions. Michael's ______________________________ (same organelle) lacked one of the forty types of enzymes, resulting in one of the many diseases that are characterized by a defect in this structure. Due to the abnormality in the organelle in question he continued to have a lot of fatty deposits that eventually caused his nervous system to fail.  Michael was paralyzed and unable to see or hear by the time he died at age 4.   Read the statement below and write in the answer in the space provided (text field Achondrogenesis type 1A is caused by a defect in the microtubules of the ____________________________ (organelle as described on the disease at the organelle level handout).

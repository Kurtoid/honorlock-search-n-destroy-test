The following question is related to code compression using the following encoding formats and sample program of 8 8-bit binaries (I1 is the first instruction and I8 is the last instruction of the program). Please note that we consider either one bit change or change in two consecutive bits in a binary (from left, 3 bits required to indicate the location). Two-entry dictionary is allowed (i.e., index can be 0 or 1). The most frequent pattern should be stored in the first location (index 0) of the dictionary.  I1:  0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0I2:  0   0   1   1   0   0   0   0            I3:  1   1   0   0   1   1   0   0 I4:  0   0   1   1   0   0   0   0I5:  1   1   0   0   1   1   1   0            I6:  0   0   1   1   0   0   0   0 I7:  1   1   0   0   1   1   0   0    I8:  1   1   1   1   1   1   0   0             Format for the Uncompressed Code:    '00' +  original 8-bit code   e.g., 00  00000000 Format for the Compressed Code with dictionary only (repetition):     '01' +  the dictionary index.  e.g., 01  0 Format for the Compressed Code with one mismatched location:     '10' + mismatched location (3 bits) + dictionary index. e.g., 10  000  0 Format for the Compressed Code with two consecutive mismatches:     '11' + leftmost bit location of the two-bit mismatch (3 bits) + dictionary index. e.g., 11  000  0 Perform frequency-based dictionary selection and code compression for program shown above. Show the dictionary entries, compressed code, and compression ratio.

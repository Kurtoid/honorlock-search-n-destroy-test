Gallilee St. Peter's fish is a mouth-brooding fish, in which one parent holds the eggs/fry in its mouth during the course of their development; thus, an individual can only care for one clutch of eggs at a time. This behavior comes at a cost to growth (they can't eat while they're mouth-brooding!), and female fecundity is strongly related to body size. When female:male sex ratios are low, mouth-brooding is done by the male. However, when females greatly outnumber males in the population, females are more likely to mouth-brood. A) What is the benefit of providing parental care? (Regardless of which sex does it.) B) It takes the same amount of time and energy for males or females to provide parental care.  What are the consequences/costs of engaging in mouth-brooding behavior for females?  For males? C) Use your answer to B to explain why males provide parental care when there is a low female:male sex ratio, and why females provide care when there is a high female:male sex ratio. (HINT: be careful to avoid group selection explanations!)

Fans of The Great British Baking Show will know that isomalt is used for making edible structures that look like glass.  Isomalt is a sugar alcohol that is produced industrially from sucrose and a major component consists of D-glucose linked alpha-1,6 with D-sorbitol.  Recall from lecture that D-sorbitol is a sugar alcohol obtained by reducing the aldehyde of D-glucose.  Choose the correct structure of isomalt from the choices shown below.  Note the carbon numbering stays the same between glucose and sorbitol, i.e., C1 stays C1, C2 stays C2, etc. By the way, if you're not (yet) a fan of The Great British Baking Show, you should be.  ;-)  The contestants are amazingly talented bakers.

This is a long answer/essay style question that requires a student to type in their words to answer.  Students may not copy/paste from other sources; they must complete the answer in their own words.  Students are encouraged to practice writing out objectives and explanations throughout the unit so they don't struggle to "find the words" at exam time.   If a written question is worth 3 points, a student must provide at least three sentences and pieces of content in their answer.  Look to utilize vocabulary, concepts, descriptions and detail in your answer.  To practice for these, look to your objectives (explain, describe, evaluate).  Don't worry about sounding "perfect" or like the "textbook" - I want you to explain to me how and what you understand. Responses that are copied from the textbook, lab manual, or Internet (quizlet, wikipedia, etc.) will earn 0 points and violate the Academic Integrity Policy.  Show me what you know and what you can explain and understand. You can come back to this and all question types within your exam attempt to add, delete or edit your answer. Question:   Are you a good test taker?  If yes, explain why.  If no, what will you do to improve your test taking ability?  What tools and behaviors can you utilize during the unit to better prepare yourself for taking and completing exams?  Do you have any questions for me, your instructor, about completing exams online?

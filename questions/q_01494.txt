31-32) Use the text below to answer questions 31-32 Howard is an instructor in the theatre program at a research university. He's interested in what individual differences predict how well students learn lines for a play.  He gives all 100 students in his class a famous speech from a play to learn by the next class period.  He asks the students in the class to keep track of how many times they read through the speech and how many times they attempt to recite the speech from memory.  During the next class period, all 100 students are asked to give the speech from memory and Howard records how many errors they each make.  Howard sees two big effects.  The first is that the more total times the students report having read/recited the speech from memory overall, the fewer errors they seemed to make.  He also finds that a certain ratio of reading-to-reciting seems to be associated with the fewest errors.   31) What type of research methods has Howard used in the scenario above?

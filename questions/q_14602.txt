VRAAG 7     'n Laboratoriumtegnikus word van drie ongemerkte bottels voorsien wat onderskeidelik 'n alkohol, 'n aldehied en 'n alkaan met vergelykbare molekulere massas bevat. Sy neem 'n monster uit elke bottel en merk hulle P, Q en R. Om elke monster te kan identifiseer, bepaal sy die kookpunt van elk onder dieselfde toestande. Die resultate word in die tabel hieronder aangetoon.   Regterklik op die onderstaande blou blokkie om die diagram in 'n nuwe venster oop te maak.       7.1   Vir hierdie ondersoek, skryf neer die:   7.1.1 Onafhanklike veranderlike 7.1.2 Afhanklike veranderlike   (1) (1)     7.2   Watter monster (P, Q of R) is die:   7.2.1 Alkaan 7.2.2 Alkohol 7.2.3 Verwys na kookpunt en die tipe intermolekulere kragte wat tussen alkoholmolekule teenwoordig is om 'n rede vir die antwoord op VRAAG 7.2.2 te gee.       (1) (1)   (2)     7.3   Die alkaan word as pentaan geidentifiseer. Sal die kookpunt van heksaan HOER AS of LAER AS die van pentaan wees? Verwys na MOLEKULERE STRUKTUUR, INTERMOLEKULERE KRAGTE en ENERGIE benodig om die antwoord te verduidelik.   (4)             [10]

The following fact pattern applies in Questions 5 and 6. Norris lived alone in a one-bedroom apartment, leased in his name. Equipped with an arrest warrant, three police officers arrived at Norris's apartment one morning at 8:30. The warrant was based on information from wiretaps and police informants and recited that there was probable cause to believe Norris was engaged in a conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. The officers knocked at the door, and when Norris, who was naked, opened the door, the officers stepped across the threshold and secured Norris against the wall. As two of the officers were effecting the arrest of Norris, a third officer, Casali, did a security sweep of the premises. While in the bedroom, Casali noticed a nightstand drawer standing slightly open with some papers protruding out. He walked to the table and, pulling the drawer slightly open, was able to see betting slips and other betting paraphernalia inside. He removed the items and returned to the living room where the other officers and Norris were now standing. Once all of officers determined that there was no one else in the apartment, they seemed to relax. The lead officer, Cobb, officially informed Norris that he was under arrest, and told him that several other agents were about to arrive with a search warrant to look for narcotics on the premises. Norris was allowed, under surveillance, to go to his bedroom and dress. He returned to the living room where Officer Cobb informed him of his Miranda rights.  Norris said he wanted a lawyer. As Norris and all three officers were leaving the apartment, Officer Cobb turned to Norris and said, "Since a few other officers will be coming here in a few minutes to conduct a search, is there anything in the apartment that would pose a threat to them, like a loaded weapon they might stumble across?" Norris replied that there was a gun in the bedroom closet, and he led the officers to it. The gun was located amidst Norris"s sweaters in a clothes closet in his bedroom. The search warrant team arrived one hour later, but found no additional evidence in the apartment. Ultimately Norris was indicted for illegal possession of gambling paraphernalia and illegal possession of a firearm.

In this question and the remaining questions, consider the kinetic theory of the ideal gas in three dimensions that we have considered previously. The distribution of particle velocities and positions is translationally and rotationally symmetric. We may think of this system as being described by certain microscopic variables (particle masses, particle number, particle velocities as well as the volume of the box) that have implications for purely thermodynamic variables such as pressure and temperature. In the remaining questions, you will be asked how rescaling certain microscopic quantities (plus volume) while keeping all of the others the same affects pressure or temperature. Recall that the macroscopic equations of state for an ideal gas are PV=nRT, E=C_V T.   When particle mass is doubled, pressure is rescaled by a factor of:

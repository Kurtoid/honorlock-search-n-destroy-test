Question 36 and 37 refer to the following passage: Manifesto of the Society for German Colonization, April 1884 "In the partition of the earth, as it has proceeded from the beginning of the fifteenth century up to our times, the German nation received nothing. All the remaining European culture-bearing peoples possess areas outside our continent where their languages and customs can take firm root and flourish. The moment that the German emigrant leaves the borders of the Reich behind him, he is a stranger sojourning on foreign soil. The German Reich, great in size and strength through its bloodily achieved unity, stands in the leading position among the continental European powers: her sons abroad must adapt themselves to nations which look upon us with either indifference or even hostility. For centuries the great stream of German emigration has been plunging down into foreign races where it is lost sight of. Germandom outside Europe has been undergoing a perpetual national decline. . . .   The Society for German Colonization aims to undertake on its own, in a resolute and sweeping manner, carefully chosen colonization projects and thereby supplement the ranks of organizations with similar tendencies. Its particular tasks will be:  to provide necessary sums of capital for colonization; to seek out and lay claim to suitable districts for colonization; to direct German emigrants to these regions."  --Carl Peters (German Author), Die Grundung von Deutsch-Ostafrika (The Foundation of German East Africa), 1906 The passages is an extension of an idea that had previously resulted in __________.

Your work for this question will be written on the same page as the work done for the next (and last) problem on this quiz. AS IF you were going to numerically solve the entire problem, answer the question below based on the given figure and the complete FBD drawn for you.    A vertical force of 50 lb acts on the crankshaft.  IF you were going to solve for the horizontal force P required at the handle and the components at the bearings at A and B, you would begin by stating the two vector equations you would solve.

Given: Catalog and Widget types as shown, select the memory diagram that best represents the memory used by w in the printWidget function. To avoid a limitation in Canvas, array code below has an extra space before the index. typedef struct { char code[ 5]; int pages; } Catalog ; typedef struct { char item[ 15]; Catalog *cat; float price; } Widget ;  void printWidget(Widget w) { printf( " item: %sn", [CODE1] ); printf( " cat: %s (%i pages)n", [CODE2] ); printf( "price: $%fn", [CODE3] ); }... Memory Symbol Key:  (a) is a contiguous block of memory that is named a  (b) is a pointer named b that contains the address to another memory location; the end of the arrow indicates the memory that is pointed to. (c) shows a larger contiguous block of memory where all items in the box are stored in a contiguous block of memory; it may have address (c) associated with its start address or be pointed to (d) shows a larger contiguous block of memory that includes a smaller block of contiguous memory that is located within the larger block; it may have address (d) associated with its start address or be pointed to

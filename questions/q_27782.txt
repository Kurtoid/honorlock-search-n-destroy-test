Vaccine Delivery  The problem of delivering biomolecules into the cell as discussed in the class is that cell transport of large molecules happens via endocytosis.  Endocytic vesicles containing the extracellular material will fuse with lysozomes, which as you remember will hydrolyze the biomolecules rendering them functionally useless. Two dramatically different approaches to circumvent this problem were utilized.  Tips: One, found in nature was described in the course, albeit in a different context.  The mechanism for the second was also described in the course, but that one was not directly discussed in class as the means of transmembrane transport.    What are the two delivery mechanisms and how they circumvent delivery problem identified above?    Be very specific about the second part of question.

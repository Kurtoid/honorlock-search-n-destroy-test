The fifteen questions in this exam are based on the following information (repeated in each question for your convenience):Kimbeth Manufacturing uses process costing to control costs in the manufacture of Dust Sensors for the mining industry. The following information pertains to operations for November.   The beginning inventory was 40% complete as to materials and 30% complete as to conversion costs. The ending inventory was 20% complete as to materials and 70% complete as to conversion costs.Costs pertaining to November are as follows:Beginning inventory: direct materials, $20,930; conversion costs, $ 13,750. Costs incurred during the month: direct materials, $182,000; conversion costs, $ 222,040.(For your convenience: Total costs to be accounted for=20,930+13,750+182,000+222,040=$ 438,720)Q4. What is the total equivalent units for CONVERSION COSTS in November, assuming Kimbeth uses first-in, first-out (FIFO) process costing?

An [Operon] is a cluster of related genes controlling sequences that turn the genes on or off.  When lactose is present it interferes with the [Repression] which would bind to the [operator] and physically blocks the attachment of [RNApolymerase1] if lactose wasn't present.  The [operator1] is a DNA segment that acts as a switch that is turned on or off.  [RNApolymerase2] will bind the the [promoter] which is a control sequence where the transcription enzyme initiates transcription.  Genes are transcribed and translation will produce all three lactose enzymes.

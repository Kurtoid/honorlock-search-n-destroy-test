Procter & Gamble's introduction of All-Temperature Cheer laundry detergent in Japan was a flop at first. The problem was that Japanese women wash clothes in cold water-either tap water or leftover bath water-so they don't care about all-temperature washing (which is a big selling point in the United States). Also, Cheer was first introduced in Japan at a time when the market for fabric softeners in Japan was rapidly expanding. However, when Japanese housewives added lots of fabric softener to the water, Cheer didn't produce many suds (Americans don't use as much fabric softener). P&G reformulated the product so it wouldn't be affected by fabric softeners, and ads for Cheer in Japan pledged superior cleaning in cold water, not all temperatures. Which of the following might have helped P&G avoid the initial problems with Cheer?

Quealy dialed 911 to report a family dispute with potential for violence. Police officers arrived at the scene and knocked on the door. They heard a loud disturbance inside. Quealy called 911 again to say that the dispute was over and that the officers could leave. The dispatcher informed the officers at the scene about this call, but the officer shouted through the door that they would need to enter the apartment before they could leave. Quealy placed two more calls to 911, again asking the officers to go away. When she finally cracked open the door, the officers pushed it open and came into the apartment. Quealy began screaming and flailing, several feet away from the officers. The officers saw nobody else in the apartment, but decided to detain Quealy long enough to check out the rest of the apartment. When they tried to restrain her, she began to resist, fell to the floor, and began to kick at one of the officers. After a struggle, two officers managed to handcuff her, seat her on a stairway outside the apartment. After securing the handcuffs to the stairway railing, and calling for a backup unit, one of the officers asked her, "Why did you keep calling 911?" She answered, "I should have stopped." Quealy is charged with misuse of 911 and interfering with an officer. Can the government introduce Quealy's statement at trial?

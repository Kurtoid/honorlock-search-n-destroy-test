A group of researchers developed a new test method for detection of synthetic marijuana (i.e., K2) in human saliva. A series of validation studies were conducted to measure performance of the test method. The results of the study are reported below.    KNOWN Predictions by Analyst SUM   Positive for K2 Negative for K2   Positive for K2 488 12 500   Negative for K2 119 381 500   SUM 607 393 1000      The researchers measured the performance of their method by calculating its accuracy using the equation shown below:  where TP is true positive, TN is true negative, P is known positive and N is known negative. Calculate the accuracy.
In an experimental procedure called FRAP, membrane proteins across an entire cell are labeled with a fluorescent tag and then a portion of them in a small area of the membrane are bleached with a laser beam. The bleach will cause those particular membrane proteins to no longer fluoresce.  Based on your understanding of the fluid mosaic model of the membrane, what do you predict will happen to the bleached portion of the membrane after a few minutes?

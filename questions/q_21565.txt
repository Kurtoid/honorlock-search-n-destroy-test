Write a C++ function that takes as an input a singly linked list pointed to by head and returns a pointer to a  new singly linked list: Node* dual_linked_list(Node *head); In this function you should create a new singly linked list that consists of nodes containing the values of every other node of the input list. Also, the new list uses a special link, called cross, to point to the input node with the same value, see the illustration:   Here is the definition of Node: struct Node {   int elem;   Node *next;   Node *cross;   Node(int e) : elem(e), next(nullptr), cross(nullptr) {}}; Provide the cost of building the above dual linked list in the terms of Big-O asymptotic notation.  Which operation/s will benefit by the above dual linked list and why?

The species of bird in the world with the longest wingspan is the wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans).  The wingspans are normally distributed with a mean of 122 inches and a standard deviation of 10.5 inches. a) What is the probability that a member of this specie has a wingspan over 131 inches? b) What is the probability that one has a wingspan between 118 and 125 inches? c) What is the probability that a wandering albatross has a wingspan of exactly 132 inches? d) How wide must the wingspan be to be in the top 15%? e) If 6 members of this species are rounded up and their wingspans measured, what is the probability that the average wingspan is less than 124 inches? f) Why can the Central Limit Theorem be used in this problem when the sample size is only 6?

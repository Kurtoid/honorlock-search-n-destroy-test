A new kitchen tool or appliance will be introduced during the first three sessions.  Recipes will increase in difficulty over the course of the group to incorporate skills learned in previous sessions.  The final session will provide members an opportunity to attempt to independently follow a recipe.  Observations made during the final session will allow you assess each member's level of independence in completing a simple meal prep task.  This information will be used to make discharge recommendations for each member. Write one short-term SMART goal that will support your long-term goal.

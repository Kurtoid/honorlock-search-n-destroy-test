A state statute forbids employers from discriminating on the basis of religion; however, an exception provides that established religions that employ persons to engage in charitable activities may be exempted from this rule. A new church was formed in the state. The church espoused a number of nontraditional views. When the church gained enough members to open a new meeting center, it advertised for janitorial and maintenance workers. A woman applied for a position and was told that she would be hired if she converted to the church's religion. The woman refused to do so and complained to the state human relations board. After investigating, the board concluded that the church was not an established religion and its beliefs were not plausible. It ruled that the religious exemption would not be applicable and ordered the church to hire the woman. Church officials filed an action in federal district court challenging the board's refusal to apply the exemption. How is the court likely to rule?

"Since 1930, the Brazilian government has been undertaking a social policy whose main goal is to protect the working classes through the betterment of their working conditions, elevating their standard of life and extending the social security system. Indeed, the 1937 constitution proclaims that work is a social duty and establishes that it is the government's responsibility to guarantee the fulfillment of this duty by securing favorable conditions for workers and protecting them. In this way, the constitution guarantees the right of organization, recognizes the current unions as representatives of the workers, and authorizes the signing of collective-bargaining agreements. Salaries are protected and must provide a minimum standard of life. The workday is eight hours long, and there is one mandatory day of rest. Paid vacations are mandatory. Workers are protected against unjustified dismissal. Minors under 14 years old are not allowed to work, and women and men under 18 years old cannot work in unhealthy sites. The constitution establishes that the state must provide medical assistance to workers, and it must protect maternity and create insurance against old age and disability. The constitution also compels professional associations to assist its members. In order to enforce these principles, the constitution anticipates the creation of a Work Tribunal whose goal will be to arbitrate in all work-related litigation."

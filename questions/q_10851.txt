Colleges have a serious problem with alcohol abuse among students, and it's not getting any better.... Binge drinking--defined as the heavy, episodic use of alcohol--has persisted on campuses despite both a general decrease in alcohol consumption among Americans and an increase in the number of abstainers. Some people (including the author of a recent front-page article in the New York Times) have assumed that the latter two trends have translated into more moderate drinking on the campuses. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our recent research, which received support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was the only large-scale study to date of the extent and consequences of binge drinking at a representative sample of American colleges and universities. Our detailed findings from surveys of 17,592 students at 140 randomly selected four-year colleges were published in the December 7, 1994,issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.... Our study found that 44 percent of all students in the sample were binge drinkers--50 percent of the men and 39 percent of the women. (Title of the article: "Too Many Colleges Are Still in Denial about Alcohol Abuse," Authors: Henry Wechsler, Charles Deutsch, and George Dowdall; Name of Periodical: Chronicle of Higher Education, Volume 41, Issue 31; Date of Publication: April 14, 1995; Page numbers: B1-B2; Database: Academic Search Complete; Access Date: August 17, 2018) In the above passage, the authors establish the credibility of their findings by providing

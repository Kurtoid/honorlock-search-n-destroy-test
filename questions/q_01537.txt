Your project scope requires that you construct a compacted fill embankment that contains 380,000 CCY  of fill. The fill consists of common earth. There is no suitable fill material on site so you are required to import (haul in) material from a borrow pit that is 15 miles away. Your trucking sub's dumps all have an average capacity of 30 LCY.  Travel speed while loaded is 45 mph and 50 mph. In addition, the trucks have to drive over a 1 mile dirt haul road  at an average speed of 20 mph. The borrow material is a clay. Assume a 50 minute work productivity for each 60 minute hour. With this information, answer the following 5 questions. (1). How many CY of material are you required to excavate at the borrow pit? (2) How many loose cubic yards of material will you be hauling? (3) You have 2 hydraulic excavators, each with a bucket capacity of 2.5 LCY. Assuming a fill factor of 1.0 and cycle time of  0.35 min/cycle what  is the combined production rate quantity per each 50 minute hour.  (4) How many trucks will your trucking sub need to make available to assure max efficiency? (5) How many days will it take to complete the excavation?

Orryn sets up a mass and pulley system, as shown in the figure. A string is wrapped around a non-uniform pulley of radius 10 cm, which can rotate freely about its axis. The loose end of the string is attached to a block. The block and pulley each have mass 4.5 kg. If Orryn observes the block accelerate downwards at a rate of 5.2 m/s2, what is the moment of inertia of the pulley?

Question 4  (Total 20 points)  START THIS QUESTION ON A NEW PAGE. SEPARATE EACH PART NICELY!BOX THE FINAL ANSWERS part a)  (17 points) If you apply a horizontal force F to a box of mass (m1+m2) its acceleration a will be F/(m1+m2) , i.e the TF from F to a  is F/(m1+m2). But, if you split the mass as shown below - with some mass (m2) being suspended inside the box (of mass m1) via two springs (k)  - what now will be the TF from the applied force F to the box's acceleration a ? All surfaces are frictionless. Choice of absolute or relative coordinates is up to youYou must show the FBD.      part b)  (3 points) Continuing the previous part. Draw a rough plot of box's acceleration when a constant force F=2 N  is applied. Assume: k = m1 = m2 = 1. Clearly calculate and mark the particular solution in your plot.

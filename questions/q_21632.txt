By a contractual agreement, Jerry had agreed to the upkeep and maintenance of the fence for a period of 5 years. Within that 5 year period, a gaping hole in the fence comes to Herb's attention. Herb notifies Jerry of the hole in the fence, but Jerry does absolutely nothing for over three months, even after Jerry visually sees the gap in the fence. After three months, the cattle roam freely across both pastures and it is nearly impossible for both owners to figure out who owns which Herefords.

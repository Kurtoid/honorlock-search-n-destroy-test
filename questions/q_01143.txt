Suppose you have identified a new pathogen that causes a different kind of leaf rust on peanut. In growing a sample of the peanut PI (plant introduction) collection, you identified one out of 100 PIs that seem to have near immunity to this disease. In a preliminary cross of this PI with your best cultivar, the F 1 was nearly immune. However, this PI has very poor agronomic characteristics.

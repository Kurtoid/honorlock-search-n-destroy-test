In a species of salamander, there are two different forms: red striped and yellow striped. Both are quite tasty.  In one area, the yellow form was quite common, and the red form was rare.  Because of this, predators ate more yellow salamanders and were thus more likely to identify the yellow salamanders (over the red) as tasty food.  This continued until the yellow salamanders were eaten so heavily that the red striped form began to outnumber them.  As the red salamanders become more common, and yellows rare, the predators were more likely to eat the red ones...and the yellow form was less likely to be eaten (and more likely to survive and reproduce).

Answer the following question based on the following scenarioDuring a kitchen inspection you observe the following. A dietary worker eating food off the line which hasn't started yet. The dietary aide states they are taste testing the food. You review the temperature logs, all the temps are acceptable, but there are none recorded for the pureed or ground foods. The staff states they took the temps but there is no place to put the results on the form. As you observe the line, you notice they are using appropriate sized scoops, but are putting heaping amounts on each plate of the macaroni and cheese. Per the written menu the regular diet should receive apple pie and the cardiac diet should receive cinnamon apple slices. You notice everyone is receiving the apple pie.

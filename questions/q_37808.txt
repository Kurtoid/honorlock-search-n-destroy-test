Individuals of a particular species of ground beetle are either light tan or dark brown. Light-tan beetles are predominant in habitats with light-colored sandy soils, and dark brown beetles are predominant in habitats with dark-colored loam soils. In an experiment designed to determine the survival rates of light-tan beetles and dark brown beetles in different habitats, 500 light-tan beetles and 500 dark-brown beetles were released in each of four habitats. Each beetle had been marked with a small spot of red paint on the underside of its abdomen before it was released. One week after the beetles had been released, any marked beetles that could be found were recaptured. The results are presented in the table below. It is assumed that differences in the numbers of beetles recaptured are directly related to differences in survival rates. Which of the following processes best explains why fewer light-tan beetles than dark-brown beetles were recaptured in habitat 4?

The Paris Accord is the first global agreement to address climate change.  It calls for highly developed countries to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions and less developed countries to stop increasing carbon dioxide emissions.  It has been signed by almost all United Nations countries. It will resolve this issue because the US has rejoined the agreement and all countries now have a legal binding agreement for the necessary carbon dioxide reductions.

The nurse is aware that which of the following is not a risk factor for the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)?
Four small bags are filled with a 10% starch solution. The bag's membrane contains microscopic pores large enough to let smaller water molecules cross but not the larger starch molecules. Bag 1 is placed in a beaker of distilled water (0% starch). Bag 2 is placed in a beaker containing a 5% starch solution. Bag 3 is placed in a beaker of 10% starch solution and bag 4 is placed in a 50% starch solution beaker.Bag 1: 10% starch / Beaker 1: 0% starchBag 2: 10% starch / Beaker 2: 5% starchBag 3: 10% starch / Beaker 3: 10% starchBag 4: 10% starch / Beaker 4: 50% starchThe bags are weighed initially and at regular intervals for a specific period of time. Some bags saw a change in weight, some did not. Answer the following questions based on the expected outcomes of this experiment.Which bag is expected to be the heaviest at the end of the experiment?

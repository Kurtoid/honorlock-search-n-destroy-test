Read the following passage by Thoreau:   He is discussing his feelings about the government's support of slavery.   All men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right to refuse allegiance to, and to resist, the government, when its tyranny or its inefficiency are great and unendurable. But almost all [people] say that such is not the case now [about slavery]. But such was the case, they think, in the Revolution of '75. ...   All machines have their friction; and possibly this does enough good to counterbalance the evil [within the machine]. ... But when the friction comes to [overtake the] machine, and oppression and robbery [become] organized, I say, let us not have such a machine any longer.    In other words, when a sixth of the population of a [free] nation ... are slaves, and ...  [when that nations is] subjected to military law, I think that it is not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize.

Bill, a 30 year old patient, presents to the office for routine dental hygiene therapy.  Bill has always reported that he has had seizures.  This visit he indicates that he has been having a seizure about once a week.  Since his seizures have been happening more frequently, his doctor has put him on phenytoin.  The dental hygienist asks Bill about his seizures and he states that he usually notices very strong smells before his seizures.  His seizures usually hast about 10 seconds, he loses consciousness, and usually his eyelids twitch.  He comes out of it quickly and usually does not remember what has happened.  During the intraoral exam the dental hygienist notes that the gingiva in the upper anterior interdental area is enlarged and is somewhat fibrotic.  Bill says he has noticed it but it is not painful. What type of seizures does Bill describe?
Which of the following is a reason for patients who have been discharged following an acute MI to undergo a symptom-limited maximal exercise test?
Graph the linear inequality in two variables.x - y > -5

III- Problems: 70 Points  The total resistance of a parallel circuit is 25 Ohms. What is the current through a 220 Ohms resistor that makes up part of the parallel circuit if the total current is 100 mA.   (10 Points)  From the circuit below, determine the resistance R2, R3 and R4.  (10 Points)      Determine all of the resistor values in the following figure. The RT = 773 W.  (10 Points)     Find the values of unspecified quantities (show in red) from the figure below such as IT, I2, I3, R1 & R2                                                                                                                                (10 Points)       Determine the total resistance RT between the terminals A and B of the following circuit. Also calculate the current in each branch (IT, I1, I2, I3, I4 & I5  ) with 10 V between A and B                                                                                            (15 Points)       Using the superposition theorem, solve for the current through R3 in the following figure                                                 (15 Points)

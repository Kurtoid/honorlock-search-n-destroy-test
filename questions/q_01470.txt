INSTRUCTIONS & RULES You have 3 hours to work on this exam. You will be graded on how well you apply the rules, cases, law, and materials we have covered in the course. Each multiple choice question is worth 1 point (total 30 points) and each essay question is worth 30 points for a total of 90 points. You must exercise judgment about how much time to devote to each question. Section 1 is the multiple choice section. All questions have FIVE answers to choose from so read each answer and should choose the "MOST" right answer from the options according to the facts presented in the question and the current state of the law. Each question is worth one point. The essay questions are typical race horse questions so identify and address all issues you see in the problem. You are to take on the role of an attorney before the Supreme Court or a justice of the Supreme Court. If you are in the role of an attorney you can be either the prosecutor or the defense attorney. You must identify at the beginning of your answer which side you are on. As an advocate you should argue your position on the issue(s) but you cannot ignore your opponent's arguments, the law, facts, or issues just because you do not agree with them. Addressing opposing viewpoints is expected. Remember to "show your math." If you are a justice you must write as the author of the majority opinion. You are to express your own thoughts and analysis of the issues involved rather than taking the role of a specific, actual justice. You can agree with a particular justice's philosophy but you must analyze and decide the issue for yourself. You are not free to overrule current precedent because you will not get four votes to support that position, however, you are free to argue there should be a re-thinking of the current law and where, and why, you would go if allowed. There will be a four-vote dissenting opinion that you must acknowledge and address. Although you are making legal arguments, you do not need to write your answer in the format of a formal brief or opinion. Write your answers as an essay. In each question you must address not only the arguments in support of your position but also the points raised by either your adversary or the dissent. Regardless of your specific answer you must analyze alternate solutions, i.e. if you decide something is not a Fourth Amendment search you must continue your analysis in light of what the other side will say are further arguments or issues. You will not be graded on the position you take on any specific issue. The fact that you advocate for a particular side is irrelevant to your score, it is your ability to analyze the issues and advocate your position that matters. Do not answer the question from the philosophical, legal, moral or other position that you believe I support just because you believe that is my opinion (you might be surprised by what I think about some things). Rather, write your answer based on your opinion, philosophy, and understanding of the law. You will be graded on your arguments, logic, thought process, and analytical skills.

This is a piece of the Pinal Schist collected near Silly Mountain (east of Apache Junction, AZ).  The parent rock of this schist was a siltstone with interbedded thin layers of sandstone.  It was then metamorphosed to become the schist.  (The blue color is due to chrysocolla, a copper silicate.)  The focus of this question deals with the grayish bands that are quartz.  (The siltstone became mica.)  One of the obvious one is indicated by the red arrow.  Follow that quartz band and you will see it drops down and then back up again with a few more little wrinkles in it. The problem is that quartz is as brittle as glass.  How can such a thin band (about 1 mm thick) of quartz be contorted in such an extreme way without breaking?

Calculate for the following electrochemical cell: Pt | Fe2+(aq), Fe3+(aq) || Zn2+(aq) | Zn given the following reduction half-reactions. Fe3+(aq) + e- - Fe2+(aq), Edeg = +0.771 V Zn2+(aq) + 2 e- - Zn(s), Edeg = -0.763 V
Snapdragons show incomplete dominance in flower color.  If a heterozygous pink flower plant is crossed with a pure-breeding white flower plant, what ratio appears in the offspring?
Keys Corporation's 5-year bonds yield 8.8%, and 5-year T-bonds yield 6.8%.   The real risk-free rate is r* =  2%, the inflation premium  for 5 years bonds is    IP = 4.4%, the default risk premium for Keys' bonds is DRP = 0.56% versus    zero for T-bonds, and the maturity risk premium for all bonds is found with    the formula  MRP =  (t - 1)*0.1%, where t = number of years to maturity.  What    is the liquidity premium (LP) on Keys' bonds?

Your firm has been asked to design the third-stage plug-flow, nitrification-denitrification reactor for one of your long-term municipal clients. Pertinent design data are as follows:  Design flow: 6.25 MGD Temperature 20 degC MLVSS/MLSS: 0.75 2nd stage nitrate (NO3--N) concentration: 30 mg/L Effluent nitrate (NO3--N) concentration: 1.0 mg/L Effluent TSS concentration: 3 mg/L Denitrification cell yield coefficient (Y): 0.85 mg MLVSS/ mg NO3--N removed Endogenous decay constant (ke): 0.04 day-1 Peak nitrate removal rate (): 0.27 mg NO3--N removed/mg MLVSSday Half-saturation constant for denitrification (KD): 0.15 mg NO3--N/L MLSS concentration: 2,800 mg/L Methanol requirement: 3.0 lb methanol/lb nitrate removed Methanol specific weight: 6.60 lb/ft3  Determine the following:  (5 pts) "Design" MCRT for denitrification (Days) (5 pts) If the design MCRT for denitrification is calculated to be 5.39 days, determine nitrate removal rate (q)(unit: mg NO3--N removed/ mg MLVSS

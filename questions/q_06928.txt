Pow Chemical Industries, a publicly owned Delaware corporation, has established a wholly owned subsidiary in Ruritania.  Under Ruritanian foreign investment law, foreign invested companies are eligible to receive one of three designations: Level 1 for state-of-the-art technology; Level 2 for advanced technology; Level 3 for high technology; and Level 4 for mature technology.  Each designation carries a number of benefits.  A Level 1 designation exempts the company from the onerous Ruritanian environmental laws for a period of fifteen years.  Under Ruritanian law, any foreign invested company can apply to the government for an L1 review/designation by paying a fee of $500,000.  Most of the companies that pay for this kind of review obtain the L1 designation they seek.  In 2005, Pow Chemical donated $5 million to Ruritania's environmental protection bureau in order to allow the bureau to purchase and install a new computer system.  In July 2006, Pow Chemical applied for a review, paid the fee, and received the L1 designation.  Later that year, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Pow Chemical with a violation of the FCPA.  What would be Pow Chemical's best defense?

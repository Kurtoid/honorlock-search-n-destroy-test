Consider a simple analytics pipeline which includes two tasks, T1 and T2. The pipeline can be implemented with MapReduce or with Spark. The execution times for T1 and T2 for each of the frameworks are given below. MR: T1=5units, T2=5units Spark: T1=4units, T2=2units 1. Estimate the execution time for the MR and Sprk implementations of the analytics pipeline, under a scenario when there is failure that occurs just before T2 completes: A. MR execution takes: [mr-endfailure] units B. Spark execution takes: [spark-endfailure] units 2. Estimate the execution time for the MR and Sprk implementations of the analytics pipeline, under a scenario when there is failure that occurs one time unit into the execution of T2: A. MR execution takes: [mr-startfailure] units B. Spark execution takes: [spark-startfailure] units

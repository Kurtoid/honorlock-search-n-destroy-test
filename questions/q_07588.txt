The authors of the student cited in Question 2 carried out an analogous study to that described in Question 3, except that the two types of E. coli cells (with and without an intact H. pylori putP gene) were each incubated with 50 mM NaCl supplemented with 20 micromolar radioactive 22Na+ (added as NaCl).  The accumulation of radioactive 22Na+ inside the E. coli cells was measured as a function of time and the data are shown below (closed circles = intact H. pylori putP gene and 200 micromolar L-Pro; open circles = intact H. pylori putP gene and no L-Pro; closed squares = no intact H. pylori putP gene and 200 micromolar L-Pro; open squares = no intact H. pylori putP gene and no L-Pro).  Note that the open circle, closed square and open square symbols lie on top of one another.  Choose the correct conclusion from these data.

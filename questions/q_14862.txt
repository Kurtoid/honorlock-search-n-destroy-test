We fade up on a Porsche. In the passenger seat is Brad (Johnny Depp). The driver, a primly dressed woman. He says, "Shall we do it?" She agrees, starts up the car and drives into a huge, gated estate. Inside, we find the library and the girl's old father behind a tank of a desk. He asks his daughter to step outside; he wants to have a private word with Brad. Once she leaves, he says, "you're not going to marry my daughter." Brad argues, "I've asked her to marry me, she loves me." The old man takes 20,000 dollars out of the desk and spreads it out in front of Brad, "you're not going to marry my daughter." Brad's totally insulted, "she's old enough, we don't need your permission." Another 20,000 is added to the pile. Brad is more righteous, "How dare you sir! You can't buy love!" The old man shoves another heap of bills onto the pile, "you're not going to marry my daughter." Brad looks at the mountain of bills, glances out to the cobblestone drive, thinks a moment and says, "Throw in the Porsche." Cut to the autumn leaves flying as Brad pulls out of town in the Porsche.(1) What structural part of the story does (1) indicate?

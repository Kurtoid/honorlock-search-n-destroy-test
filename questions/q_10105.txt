(This is a thinking question. Read it twice, think about it for a few seconds, and then look at the answer choices!) Death cap mushrooms produce a substance called alpha-amanitin. Alpha-amanitin efficiently blocks synthesis of mRNA, but not of tRNA or rRNA, in eukaryotic organisms. This is possible because alpha-amanitin efficiently interferes with ________.

You are sitting next to a friend that has the exact same virus you had last week (you know for sure it is the same one and you are feeling better now). Your friend coughs and you inhale some of that virus. That virus will be caught first most likely by a [48] (48: cell type). The cell type in #48 is then going to show the virus or a piece of the virus to a [49] (49: cell type). The cell type in #49 is going to then release [50] (50: a chemical) which will eventually activate the cells that create the humoral response called: [51] (51: general cell type) as well as the cells that create the cellular response called: [52] (52: general cell type). Since this is not the first time this virus has been in your body the response you have to the virus this time will be stronger and this is primarily due to the fact that you have [53](53: 2 specific cell types: put in 2 letters with no spaces, periods, or commas) already formed from the initial exposure. The main cellular weapon in the cellular side of adaptive immunity is called: [54] (54: specific cell type). When the cells that create the humoral response are activated to start releasing their weapons they become (or are now called): [55] (55: specific cell type) which means they are in the blood releasing the main weapons of the humoral side of the adaptive immune system which are called: [56] (56). These main weapons of the humoral side of the adaptive immune system have many different ways of acting on their targets. One of the ways this works is called: [57](57) and this occurs by activating the complement protein system which leads to an infected cell being destroyed. Another way these weapons work is to cause the virus or cells infected by that virus to clump together which is called: [58] (58). Finally, another very important mechanism is by these weapons "marking" an infected cell for phagocytosis which leads to a macrophage engulfing and destroying the infected cell, this is called:[59](59).

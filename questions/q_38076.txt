Bone consists of four types of cells, each cell type has a unique function and is found in different locations in bones. These bone cells are the primary cell of mature bone and the most common type of bone cell. Each one is located in a space (lacuna) surrounded by bone tissue. They maintain the mineral concentration of the matrix. They are able to communicate with each other and receive nutrients via long cytoplasmic processes that extend through channels within the bone matrix.

You are performing marketing research for the AT&T wish to predict whether or not a consumer will not renew, i.e., churn (1=Yes,0=No).

Waves of smooth muscle contraction that propels (moves) digestive contents through the alimentary canal is:
In corn kernels, dark purple color (D) is dominant over yellow color (d) and smooth texture (T) is dominant over rough texture (t).  The gene for color is unlinked to the gene for texture, so inheritance of these traits follows Mendel's Principle of Independent Assortment.  If two doubly heterozygous plants are crossed, what proportion of the offspring would be expected to have dark purple, smooth kernels?

Carbon Dioxide transport hybrid. Input a letter only using the answer bank below. Answers can be used more than once. The primary method of carrying CO2 is [14] (14). This primary method can occur in both the red blood cell (RBC) and the plasma, but it happens much more rapidly in the RBC due to the presence of[15](15). At the tissues the CO2 moves [16] (16: J or K) the RBC and combines with [17] (17) to form carbonic acid which dissociates into [18](18) and [19](19), The [20](20) immediately binds to hemoglobin and the [21](21) trades places with Cl-and moves [22](22: J or K) the RBC. Now this same RBC makes it's way back to the lungs. While at the lungs [23](23) comes into the RBC and is loaded onto the heme (iron) group of hemoglobin which pushes [24](24) off of hemoglobin so that it ("it" is #24) can combine with [25](25) to again form carbonic acid which will dissociate into water and[26](26) which is then breathed out of the lungs (this chemical #26 is also the strongest driver of ventilation).     A. Dissolved in plasma   E. Hemoanhydrase   I. Deoxyanhydrase   M. H2O   Q. HCO3-     B. On the heme group of hemoglobin   F. Carbonic anhydrase   J. Into   N. H2CO3   R. OH     C.

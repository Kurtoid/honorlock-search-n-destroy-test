The following data concerns a randomized controlled trial. Two groups of 100 men with systolic blood pressure in the 120 to 130 range and diastolic blood pressure in the 80 to 90 range are treated to reduce the "pre-hypertensive" state. The men are in the age range 30 to 40 years. The control group 1 is given placebo and the experimental group 2 is given a treatment .to reduce blood pressure. The standard deviation of the blood pressure is s = 27. The results are as follows:   NOTE: bar X is the sample mean               bar X1=131, bar X 2=120, n1=100, n2=100, s1=27 and s2=27   Analyze this data to determine if the treatment has a significant effect. That is the treatment given to group 2 is associated with a significant reduction in blood pressure. Find a null hypothesis and find an alternative hypothesis (Ho, Ha) to conduct this test.

Consider the design of two logic circuits that both have four inputs: A, B, C and D; and one output: X.  Each circuit is implemented using 4-input AND gates (with negated inputs) and an OR gate to generate the output.  For circuit 1, X is defined to be 1 if and only if the unsigned binary representation of A, B, C and D is less than 7.Note A is the most significant bit, then B, then C, and D is the least significant. For circuit 2, X is defined to be 1 if and only if the total number of 1's among A, B, C and D is exactly 2.  Which of the following 4-input gates would be used in the implementation of both circuits?
On the Excel spreadsheet, there are two matrices (Matrix A and Matrix B) highlighted in yellow on the "Exam2-Q51" tab). Complete the following matrix operations: (1) Calculate [C]=[A]*[B] using "MMULT" function in the designated blue area; (2) Calculate the Determinant of Matrix A using "MDETERM" function in the designated blue area; (3) Get the transpose of Matrix A using a VBA program; (4) On the "Exam2-Q52" tab, calculate [C]=[A]*[B] using a VBA program.   You will need to use "option base 1" in matrix or array VBA programs. The algorithm for the transpose of a matrix [A] is: Transpose matrix AT (j,i) = A (i,j)   The algorithm for matrix multiplication is: For i = 1 to (number)             For j = 1 to (number)                         For k = 1 to (number)                                  C (i,j) = C (i,j) + A (i,k)* B (k,j)                         Next k             Next j Next i Note: The first two sub-questions, (1) and (2), are Excel spreadsheet problems, and no programming is required. The code/formulas should be written such that values in blue change correctly if the values in yellow change and the code is re-executed. Once complete, please type a one-word essay (e.g., "ok") for this question and then upload your combined Excel file at the very end of this exam.

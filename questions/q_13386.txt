The other trooper remained in the patrol car and ran a computer check of the license number of the driv's car. The computer check indicated that there was an outstanding warrant for the driv's arrest for unpaid traffic tickets. The troopers then arrested the driver. After handcuffing her, the troopers searched her person and placed her into the back seat of the patrol car. Then they searched the driv's car and discovered 10 glassine bags of heroin in a paper bag on the back seat. Later it was learned that the driver had paid the outstanding traffic tickets 10 days earlier and the warrant had been quashed, but the clerk of the court had failed to update the computer, which continued to list the warrant as outstanding.

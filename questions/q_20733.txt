Question 45 (35 Points) Ann and her husband, Bob, aren't getting along, and Bob has moved out of their home and is living with his mother in her rural home. Ann wants to kill Bob and collect on the large life insurance policy that they have on him. Ann asks her friend Katya to help her kill Bob. Ann's proposed plan is simple. On a night when Bob's mother would be away playing cards with her friends, Ann would lure Bob into the front yard by asking him to come out "to talk," and then Katya would shoot Bob with a gun provided by Ann. Katya agrees, and Ann gives her a revolver. (Both women are hunters and are adept with guns.)   Katya later feels terrible, however, and decides that she could not possibly help kill Bob. She has known him for a long time, and he is a decent guy. Besides, if Ann doesn't appreciate him, maybe Bob would eventually take an interest in her? Katya decides to warn Bob and to only pretend to go through with Ann's plan. On the agreed day, Katya goes to Bob's workplace and leaves a letter on the front seat of his truck describing Ann's entire plot and Katya's proposed role. Katya notes that she is leaving it up to Bob whether to simply confront Ann, report Ann to the police, or whether he wants to "set up" Ann that night, i.e., the police could secretly observe the whole encounter and then arrest Ann. Katya assures Bob that she will only use blanks and that she has no desire to hurt him.   Unfortunately, although Bob notices the envelope on the front seat of his truck after work, he puts it in his coat pocket, intending to read it later, but then doesn't. When Katya doesn't hear from Bob, she assumes that he wants to go ahead with the plan of setting up Ann. When Katya and Ann arrive that night, Bob's mother is gone. Katya gets situated in her assigned spot near some bushes in a side yard, nervous about not hearing directly from Bob and not seeing any sign of police. When Bob agrees to come outside to talk with Ann, Katya decides to go ahead with her revised plan, which can't hurt Bob anyway, since she is only using blanks. When Katya fires the blank round from the side yard, however, Bob reacts instinctively. He pulls out his own gun, which he nearly always has with him, and shoots Katya. Katya collapses in the yard and dies a few minutes later. Bob later reads the letter from Katya and turns it over to police. Ann is then arrested and charged.   Consider the following crimes: Solicitation, Conspiracy to Commit Murder, Attempted Murder, and Murder.   "Murder" is defined in this jurisdiction as "causing the death of another person purposely, knowingly, or through extreme recklessness, and without justification or excuse."   Consider each of these four possible crimes as they would be understood under the traditional common law approach. State whether each of these crimes could or could not be established against Ann and explain why.   Then do the same thing using the Model Penal Code approach.   Conclude by stating which crime(s) Ann would most likely be actually convicted of under both the common law approach and the MPC approach.

These snakes eat birds, lizards, and small mammals in their native range of Australia. Since no species on Guam eats the snakes, their population has grown rapidly.  Researchers estimate that two million tree snakes now inhabit the island. So far, 10 species of birds and 5 species of lizards have disappeared from Guam; small mammals have also decreased in abundance.

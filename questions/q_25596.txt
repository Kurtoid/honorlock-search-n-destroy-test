CASE. Please indicate the best DSM-V diagnosis(es). for the attached clinical vignette, from the information given and (briefly describe why you decided on that diagnosis (4 points).    The patient is a 42-year old man who admits himself to a mental hospital in 1982, after attempting suicide by taking sleeping pills. He says that nothing in particular prompted this attempt, but that he has been very depressed, with only minor fluctuations, ever since he returned from Vietnam ten years earlier. He describes a reasonably normal childhood and adolescence. He had friends throughout high school, always got at least average grades, and never was in trouble with the law or other authorities. He has had many girlfriends but has never married. After high school, he went to technical school, was trained as an electrician, and was working in this occupation when he was drafted for military service in Vietnam. He loathed the violence there. Serving in the military seems to him totally out of keeping with his character. He was honorably discharged from the army, and has never worked since, except for three weeks when an uncle hired him. He has been living on various forms of government assistance. In the army the patient began to drink heavily and to use whatever drugs he could get his hands on, abusing most of them; but in the last few years, he has turned to alcohol and cocaine. He has been drinking and using coke very heavily and nearly continually for the past 10 years, with blackouts, frequent arrests for public intoxication, and injuries in barroom brawls. He has acquaintances, but no friends. Whenever he "dries out," he feels terribly depressed (as he also does when he drinks.; he has made four suicide attempts in the last seven years. For the month before his latest suicide attempt, he had been living in an alcohol-treatment residence, the longest dry period he can remember, all previous attempts at cutting down on his drinking having failed.  The patient presents as a very sad, thoughtful, introspective man with a dignified bearing, and in informal conversation appears to be of at least normal intelligence. He is not interested in anything and confides that when he sees others enjoying themselves, he is so jealous he wants to hit them; this urge is never evident from his unfailingly courteous behavior. There is no evidence of delusions, and no history of hallucinations except during several bouts of Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium in the past. His appetite is normal, as is his sex drive, "but I don't enjoy it." He has trouble falling asleep or staying asleep without medication. He complains of "absentmindedness." After two weeks, the patient still had trouble finding his way around the ward. He seemed very well motivated to cooperate with neuropsychological testing and was extremely distressed by his disabilities. Testing revealed impaired immediate and long-term memory, apraxias, agnosias, peripheral neuropathy, and constructional difficulties; his IQ measured 66. The patient has not responded to antidepressant medication. He is sorry that his suicide attempt did not succeed, and he says that if things aren't going to get any better, he definitely wants to die.    Please list his diagnoses and reasons you have chosen them.

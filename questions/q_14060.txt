They asked participants, on a Likert scale of 1-7, to indicate how much they agreed with many statements regarding health care, education, politics, and the statement of interest: "I think recycling is a useful strategy for saving the Earth." During the session, participants were given a small plastic cup filled with water. After completing the survey, participants excited the room, outside of which there was a recycling bin and a garbage bin. The researchers noted which bin the participant discarded the cup into.

The the disposal of the cup was a(n) [answer2] type of dependent variable.

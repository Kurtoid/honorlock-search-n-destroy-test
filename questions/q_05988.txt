Short Answer Set 1:  SA 1. Ion channels are typically gated. Define 'gating' in this context and identify the three different stimuli that function to gate ion channels. SA 2. There are many regulatory steps involved in converting the information stored in genomic DNA to an active protein. Identify one post-transcriptional and one post-translational regulatory mechanism present in eukaryotic cells. SA 3. Identify the three transport mechanisms used for the intracellular trafficking of proteins that contain a sorting signal. Provide an example of an organelle that acquires its protein through each of these mechanisms. SA 4. A ribosome is described as having an A-, a P-, and an E-site. Identify the specific tRNA that occupies each of these sites during translation. SA 5. Identify two roles for SNARE proteins in vesicular trafficking. SA 6. Identify the direction of potassium ion movement by the potassium leak channels.  Is this an active or a passive process? What is the driving force for this movement? In which membrane is this channel found?

Scenario: Read the following information about Kimo.  Think about development, developmental responsiveness, and appropriate responses to this situation based on middle school philosophy.  Kimo enters the room and recognizes a couple kids from his first period class, but he doesn't know their names. The teacher tells the class to take out some paper and put their names on it.  She wants names in the upper left corner of the paper--or is it bottom left? Kimo panics when he realizes that this teacher wants all work in ink, and he already lost all twenty pens that his mother bought at Costco! The class is studying political elections. The teacher tells the class to read the next chapter in the textbook and answer the review questions at the end. When the teacher sees Kimo writing in pencil she says, "Son, where is your pen?!" She tells him to come after school for detention. Kimo gets back to work, gritting his teeth. The bell rings just as Kimo's eyes are starting to glaze over while staring at "media bias" in the text. As Kimo makes his way back across campus, some kids bump him and knock his books out of his hands. Dozens of kids pass by, but no one knows Kimo so nobody stops to help him.  Considering the middle school philosophy - what is one change to the school that could help Kimo have a better day at school? Explain how that structure would help.

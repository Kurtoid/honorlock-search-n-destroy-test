(6 pts)        What are three major differences between residential and commercial mortgage underwriting?        c.   (2 pts.)        Sources of funding for commercial real estate can be broadly classified into four categories: public debt, private debt, public equity, and private equity.  Which two categories provide the most commercial real estate funding?      a.  (5 pts.)         List 5 charges usually paid by the borrower to the lender that are properly categorized as financing charges.        b.   (5 pts.)        List the 5 items taken into account by most credit scoring systems.      (6 pts. - 3 pts. each)  Define the following mortgage pool characteristics and explain how each affects the required rate of return demanded by investors in the mortgage pool. a.  Geographic distribution of mortgages b.  Number of seasoned mortgages      a.  (5 pts.)         Describe the process of securitization.  A picture might be helpful.        b.   (2 pts.)        What is the main difference between a planned amortization class (PAC) tranche and a targeted amortization class (TAC) tranche?      (9 pts.)         Discuss three ways that lenders can reduce the risks they face in construction lending.      (8 pts.)  Compute the return to owning versus renting if you sell after only one year in the following scenario: you financed your purchase using an 80% LTV, fully amortizing fixed rate mortgage on a $322,000 house at 2.5% for 30 years.  Assume that you are in the 25% federal tax bracket, that you expect $50 per month in maintenance expenses, that mandatory membership in the homeowner's association costs $60 per month, that your yearly hazard insurance premiums are $1,485, and that homes in your neighborhood are appreciating at about 3.25% per year.  Further, assume that the tax assessor just set the assessed value of your home at $82,000 and that property taxes in the amount of $22 per $1,000 of assessed value will be due at the end of the first year.  Renting a comparable property would cost $1,950 per month, and selling expenses in your area average about 5% of sale price.      (5 pts)  Suppose that you have a salaried position paying $171,000 per year and that you have no other source of income.  Assume you have monthly payments totaling $1,600 for your car, student loans, and credit cards.  Based on your credit score, the best rate you can get on an 80% LTV loan is 2.75% over 30 years with monthly payments.  Using the traditional conventional mortgage underwriting guidelines discussed in class (i.e. Housing Ratio of 28% and Total Debt Ratio of 36%), what is the largest mortgage loan for which you could qualify?      You are analyzing a mortgage pool that consists of the following groups of mortgages. Mortgages within each group are identical.      Group   Balance   Contract Rate   Remaining Term     Group A   $75 million   2.85%   20 years     Group B   $150 million   3.00%   25 years     Group C   $225 million   3.15%   30 years     Group D   $130 million   3.50%   30 years       a.   (6 pts.)       Compute the WAM and WAC for this mortgage pool. b.   (2 pts.)       How much money should we expect to be paid into the pool each month? c.   (4 pts.)        If we believe that this pool will prepay at 150% of PSA, how much will the prepayment be in month 14?  For simplicity, use the beginning pool balance in this calculation - do not try to compute the pool balance at month 14.        (15 pts.)  Assume I purchase $750,000,000 of 20-year, fixed-rate residential mortgages with an average interest rate of 5.75%.  I intend to issue 3 sequential pay tranches backed by these mortgages.  Tranche A is $275,000,000 and promises a 4.25% return.  Tranche B is $200,000,000 and promises a 5.00% return.  Tranche Z is $225,000,000 and promises a 5.75% return.  Compute the amortization sheet and the Tranche A cash flows for the first 3 years of the pool.  For simplicity, assume these mortgages and the pool have annual payments.      (5 pts.)  Suppose that I take out a 90% LTV construction loan at 7.5% over three years with monthly payments.  The initial draw is 20% of the loan amount.  The remaining draws occur monthly over the remaining 35 months and are for equal amounts.  The project cost $27,000,000, and payments are interest-only.  What is the payment in month 17?       Here are some formulas that might come in handy.

Please use the following case scenario to answer questions #75 and 76.  Is the winter of 2020 and you are called to a purebred Hereford farm in south GA to evaluate one of their replacement heifers (4 month-old) that is not doing well. At physical examination, her body condition score is 2/9, she is severely depressed, has rough hair, white mucous membranes, and diarrhea. You quickly take a blood sample for PCV/TP and a fecal sample for a fecal float exam. PCV is 25% and TP is 3.0 g/dL. Fecal float is full of what appears to be Strongyle type eggs. You suspect heavy GI parasitism and likely ostertagiasis. Question 75: What is the best treatment for this heifer?

Assume that we have built a velocity filter followed by a region of uniform magnetic field. In the following figure I show 6 sample paths for particles after they leave the velocity filter and are now in the region of the magnetic field. Match these six particles to the most likely path taken: protons (m=mp, q=+e{"version":"1.1","math":"m=mp, q=+e"}), neutrons (m=mp, q=0{"version":"1.1","math":"m=mp, q=0"}), electrons (m=me, q=-e{"version":"1.1","math":"m=me, q=-e"}), positrons (m=me, q=+e{"version":"1.1","math":"m=me, q=+e"}),He2+{"version":"1.1","math":"He2+"} (m=4mp, q=+2e{"version":"1.1","math":"m=4mp, q=+2e"}) andHe1+{"version":"1.1","math":"He1+"} (m=4mp, q=+e{"version":"1.1","math":"m=4mp, q=+e"}). (Note that each path should match to exactly one particle and each correct match is 3 points)

Water is heated using a parabolic solar trough from [Ti]oC to [Te]oC as it flows through a [L] m long tube with a inner diameter of [d] cm. Assume that the solar trough provides uniform heating throughout the surface of the tube. If the hot water is provided at [vol] m3/min, find  the heat transfer rate the surface heat flux to the tube estimate the inner surface temperature of the tube at the exit.

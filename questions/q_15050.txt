Assume a closed economy, with no government, is characterized by the following production function:     Y = 4(K1/3)(L2/3) The savings rate in this economy is s = .40, the rate at which capital depreciates is  = .04, and the growth rate of the population n = .06 (there's no technological growth so g = 0). a) Calculate the steady-state level of capital per actual worker (k*), output per actual worker (y*), consumption per actual worker (c*), and investment per worker (i*). If the current population is equal to L = 20, calculate aggregate output (Y) and the capital stock (K) assuming that we are at the steady-state. b)  What is the golden savings rate (s'golden) and k*golden? If the savings rate were to increase from s=.40 to s=.50, how would this affect y, c, and i initially and would those variables be higher or lower at the new steady-state compared to the steady-state in (a)?

Balance the equation below by placing the correct coefficients in the blanks. Your response should list the coefficients in order from left to right, separated only by commas; no spaces. If no coefficient belongs in a blank, represent it with a "1". For example the equation 2 H2O -  2 H2+O2 would be represented as 2,2,1.    ____H2(SO4) +____Cr   -    ____H2  +  ____Cr2(SO4)3

Read these questions, then take mental note of which one you prefer to answer: Option A: Suppose that a new disease has swept across Washington state. Those who are infected with this disease develop lesions on the skin. Many scientists suspect that the new disease is caused by a pathogen called Bobo Virus. Scientists have found that this virus is relatively easy to grow in the laboratory using cell culture. There is also a murine (mouse) model for studying the pathogenic effects of this virus. Through their work, scientists have found that Bobo Virus causes respiratory illness (instead of skin lesions) in 3% of the mice infected. (a) In correct order, list all of Koch's postulates. (b) Based on the information provided above, do you see any problems with identifying Bobo Virus as the cause of the new Washington State disease? Why or why not?

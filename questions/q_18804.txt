ESSAY and SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS(Approx. Time: 2 Hours, 30 Minutes)   Jim and Dave Wang have been married for five years.  They live in Clayton, New Mexico, a town in the northern part of the state just across the border from Texas.  Jim works in Clayton as a rock climbing instructor and guide.  Dave is a certified cheese specialist and affineur (someone who is expert at aging cheese).  Dave works for Mountmar Cheese as its Vice President of Research and Development.  Mountmar Cheese has its state-of-the-art facility in Dumas, Texas, located just thirty miles over the border from Clayton, New Mexico.  Dave spends about three days a week in Dumas in an apartment that he rents near the Mountmar Cheese compound.  When he is not in Dumas he works remotely from the house he shares with Jim.  Dave has a New Mexico driver's license and votes in New Mexico.  He also has two cars, one that he owns jointly with Jim that is registered in New Mexico and one that he owns--in only his name--that is registered in Texas.   Before moving to Clayton with Jim, Dave lived in Miami, Florida for over thirty years.  Dave loved the southwest and was happy to move there with his husband, but the cold desert nights were hard for him.  Growing up and living in such a warm climate like Florida's made the cold weather a bit of a struggle.  The Wangs were avid campers and mountain climbers.  They often took overnight trips to get to remote climbing locations.  The downside of some of these trips for Dave was how cold the tent would get at nighttime.  Jim decided to look into purchasing a portable propane heater to use on their camping trips.  He went to his local Clayton, New Mexico, Lo Depot to inquire about buying a heater. (Lo Depot is a national home improvement supply store.) Jim met with a sales specialist who took him through all of the portable propane heaters carried by the store.  After hearing how Jim intended to use the heater, the sales specialist recommended the Mr. Remington Portable Buddy Heater, a 4,000-9,000 BTU liquid propane heater that connected directly to a small, one-pound cylinder propane tank.  This seemed perfect for the Wangs, so Jim purchased the heater and gave it to Dave for his birthday.   Two weeks later, the Wangs went on their first camping trip with the new heater.  They went to a remote part of New Mexico.  The first night, it worked great.  The Wangs were able to heat up their tent before going to sleep, and the heat captured in the tent kept Dave from getting too cold.  The second night, Dave happily went to turn on the heater, but something went wrong.  The tent caught fire and Dave was trapped inside.  Jim was able to put out the fire and pull Dave out, but Dave suffered severe burns.  Dave survived, but he is no longer able to work.  He has also undergone multiple skin graft surgeries and is scheduled for several more.  The Wangs have suffered financially and emotionally, so they decided to look into litigation in order to recover some of their losses.    After visiting with an attorney, Dave learned that he might have some valid state and federal negligence claims against Lo Depot and Mr. Remington.  New Mexico state law provides that all state product liability claims are covered by the New Mexico Products Liability Act.  Under federal law, there is also the National Retailer Tort Claims Act.  The NRTCA allows a plaintiff to sue a national retail chain for negligence in any state or federal court located in the state where the plaintiff allegedly sustained injury from a product purchased from that national chain.  According to the Wangs' attorney, Lo Depot qualifies as a national retailer under the Act.  Lo Depot is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois.  The Wangs' attorney also advised that Dave could bring state product liability claims against Mr. Remington.  Mr. Remington is a Texas corporation with its principal place of business in Austin, Texas.

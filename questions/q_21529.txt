Photosynthesis is the process by which organisms such as green plants, algae, and cyanobacteria convert light energy from the sun to chemical energy stored in the bonds of carbohydrates. Chlorophyll is a pigment employed by many autotrophic organisms to absorb the various wavelengths of visible light from the sun for use in photosynthesis. A variety of photosynthetic pigments exist; they are specifically adapted for absorbing different ranges of the visible light spectrum and reflecting others. The absorption spectrum of chlorophyll and accessory pigments can be obtained through spectrophotometry and later used to gain insight into plant growth, determine the abundance of photosynthetic organisms in fresh- or saltwater, and evaluate water quality. The data in Figure 11.1 and Table 11.2 were collected by students measuring the absorption spectra of three commonly encountered photosynthetic pigments.   Based on the information in Figure 11.1 and Table 11.2, which pigment has the highest relative absorbance in the red portion of the spectrum?

The above graphs show the effect of physical activity on bone mass throughout life for both male and female humans. For each graph, the red curve represents a continuous exercise effect. The yellow curve represents a sedentary person engaging in normal activities (such as walking, but not regular continuous exercise). Note for each group that exercise is introduced at different points in life (ages).   Based on the provided graphs, when does peak bone mass occur for boys/men?

PROBLEM: Computing the BMI (Body Mass Index) is a common way to screen weight categories that may lead to health problems. Your task is to write a program to compute the BMI for patients at a clinic. Specifically, your program should do the following:  Ask the user to enter how many patients will will have BMI computed. Validate the number of patients so only a value in the range [1..10] is accepted. For each patient:  Ask the user to enter the weight (lbs) and height (inches). Assume inputs are valid. Compute the BMI using the formula: 703*weight / height^2 If the BMI is in the range [18.5..25], output the message "Normal". If it is below that range, output "Underweight". If it is above the range, output "Overweight".   Using the conventions discussed in class, use draw.io to create the flowchart for the solution to this problem. Use draw.io website to create your flowchart. Export it as a PDF file and upload that file.

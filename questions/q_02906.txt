When placed on an agar plate and incubated at 30degC for 2 days, a single yeast cell undergoes cell division and proliferates into a colony with a diameter of 2 mm containing 108 yeast cells.  If the cell has a functional Ade2 gene (Ade2 +), the colony will be white if Ade2 is non-functional (Ade2 -), the colony will be black.  You take a strain with Ade2 - at the regular chromosomal position (black colonies), and insert a second, functional Ade2 + gene near the centromere. You find that the resulting colonies are a mixture of black and white patches or sectors. The figure below shows some resulting colonies from this experiment.  You measure acetylation of the N-termini of histones H3 and H4 that are located near the centromeric Ade2 + in WHITE colonies. In these cells, do you expect to find:

The picture below shows a hypothetical trophic cascade for top-down regulation of a coral reef community (don't worry about the numbers in the picture).    The researchers who constructed this put forth two hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: That the removal of sharks due to targeted fishing could result in predator release, resulting in increased abundance of mesopredators and reduced abundance of their prey, herbivorous (algae-eating) fish. This could then lead to increases in algae and a decrease in coral cover. Hypotheses 2: That the removal of certain "targeted" mesopredator fish due to fishing could cause an increase in territorial damselfishes, which graze on coral. This could also lead to declines on coral and increases in algae They then tested these hypotheses by comparing shark/fish abundance, algae biomass, and coral cover in both "fished" and "unfished" sites on the outer Great Barrier Reef in Australia ("unfished" sites are sites that do not permit fishing).  They obtained a large dataset, which is shown in the graphs below. These graphs basically just show the relationship between 2 variables. For example, the top left graph shows the density of sharks in unprotected (fished) versus protected (unfished) reefs.  As another example, the graph that is 3 rows down on the right shows the relationship between how many territorial grazers are present (y-axis) based on how many mesopredators are present (x-axis).  The line in the graph shows the "trendline" of the relationship, whereas the gray shaded area shows the confidence intervals around the trendlines (the confidence interval is sort of like the range around the estimates). Use these data to evaluate their two hypotheses (separately). To do this, you should use the data describe the "real-world" relationships between the different levels of the food web and make a conclusion about whether you think the data support these hypotheses or not and why. *Don't get scared about these graphs! While it is true that there are a bunch of them, they are fairly straightforward.

An issue that students are concerned with is rising tuition costs. As such, it makes sense for the University to understand this issue better. Let's say that the University has contracted you to do a study of tuition perceptions on campus.

For each of the following sentences, fill in the blanks with the best word or phrase selected from the list below. Not all words or phrases will be used; each word or phrase should be used only once.For an uncharged molecule, the direction of passive transport across a membrane is determined solely by its 1__________________ gradient. On the other hand, for a charged molecule, the 2__________________ must also be considered. The net driving force for a charged molecule across a membrane therefore has two components and is referred to as the 3__________________ gradient. Active transport allows the movement of solutes against this gradient. The transporter proteins called __4________________ transporters use the movement of one solute down its gradient to provide the energy to drive the uphill transport of a second gradient. When this transporter moves both ions in the same direction across the membrane, it is considered a(n) _5_________________; if the ions move in opposite directions, the transporter is considered a(n) 6__________________. anti-port    coupled            membrane potentialATP hydrolysis    electrochemical    symportconcentration    light-driven    uniport Please write down best word or phrase selected from the list above in the order as listed.

Which blood vessel is the most common location for venipuncture?
The manager of a mobile phone accessory store e-mailed a wholesaler of mobile phone cases to place an order for 100 mobile phone cases in various colors sized to match the most popular brand of mobile phones. In the e-mail, the manager asked the wholesaler if the cases would fit the newest model of that phone. The wholesaler's reply said, "That phone's brand name is listed on the packaging of the cases." Both parties were unaware that the mobile phone manufacturer had just released a new generation of phones that were slightly larger in size. Upon receiving the shipment, the manager discovered that the cases will not fit the newest phone model. The manager is uncertain whether she can resell all of the cases since they only fit older phones. Which of the following is the most appropriate remedy for the manager?

11. Describe the principle of operation of pyroelectric meter.                                         12. Draw the Fresnel reflections produced by a positive lens. From which surface (1st, 2nd) the reflections present an eye hazard and why?                                         13. An atom, making a downward transition from the 4th to the 2nd energy level, releases a photon. Determine the (a) energy (J), (b) frequency, (c) wavelength, and (d) wavenumber for this photon.                                         14. Determine the values of the amplitude reflection/transmission coefficients for light incident at 300 on an air-glass interface (ng=1.50).                                       15. What percentage of the incoming irradiance is reflected/transmitted at normal incidence on an air-flint glass (1.66) interface?                                       16. The output power of an argon laser operating at a wavelength of 700 nm is measured by a photoelectric power meter with a detector 150 mm in diameter. Figure 1 illustrates the meter calibration curve. The calculated irradiance is 577 mW/cm2. Determine the power of the laser.

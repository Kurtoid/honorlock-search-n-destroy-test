Because of these renovations, a new parking policy will be in effect between the months of February and December this year. Please circulate the memo to all your division employees and make an announcement at your next Division meeting. Between February and July, Administration and Finance employees can continue to use the first-level of the south side garage. Textile and Packaging employees can continue to use the second-level of the south side garage between Feb. and July. Service and Manufacturing employees can use either the second level of the south side garage or park in the south side lot at this time.

YOU MUST SHOW YOUR WORK FOR ALL COMPUTATIONS. Suppose it takes 10 milliseconds for a processor to add two matrices and it takes 1 millisecond for a processor to receive a matrix over the network/bus. (a) Assuming the processor already has the data in its local storage, how long would it take a single processor to add 7 matrices? Explain your answer. (b) How long would it take 4 processors to add 7 matrices? Provide a schedule/timeline below indicating what each processor is during each time unit (millisecond). Assume processors initially do not have any of the matrices in local memory. (c) What is the achieved speedup in the parallel operation from step (b)? (d) What is the associated efficiency (to the nearest percent) in the parallel operation from step (b)? (e) Does it make sense in this case to use parallel processing? Explain your answer.

Standard disclaimer: use the algorithms from class, such as DFS, Explore, BFS, Dijkstra's (using min-heaps), SCC, etc., as a blackbox subroutine for your algorithm. If you attempt to modify one of these algorithms you will not receive full credit, even if it is correct. Make sure to explain your algorithm in words (no pseudocode!), explain the correctness of your design, and state and analyze its running time. Faster - and correct - solutions worth more credit.   The state of Georgia is trying to improve their system of highways. The governor approved the construction of one new road to connect two existing cities, and a list of propositions were presented. They hire you to decide the best choice whose addition to the existing roads results in the maximum decrease in the driving distance between Atlanta and Savannah. Design an efficient algorithm to help Georgians!  Your input is a map of cities along with the roads connecting them. For every such road  , you are giving the driving distance   . You are also given a set of candidates for the new road:   along with their driving distances  . The candidates are new roads, so they do not exist in the current network of cities and roads. Your output is the new road that results in the greatest decrease in the minimum driving distance between Atlanta and Savannah.

E.  Inferences Read the passage below, taken from the autobiographical book Move On by the television journalist Linda Ellerbee.  Then, in the spaces provided, choose the letter of the most logical answer to each question, based on the information given in the passage.                 Television changed my family forever.  We stopped eating dinner at the diving-room table after my mother found out about TV trays.  We kept the TV trays behind the kitchen door and served ourselves from pots on the stove.  Setting and clearing the dining-room table used to be my job; now, setting and clearing meant unfolding and wiping our TV trays, then, when we'd finished, wiping and folding our TV trays.  Dinner was served in time for one program and finished in time for another.  During dinner we used to talk to one another.  Now television talked to us.  If you had something you absolutely had to say, you waited until the commercial, which is, I suspect, where I learned to speak in thirty-second bursts.  As a future writer, it was good practice in editing my thoughts.  As a little girl, it was lonely.  Once in a while, I'd pass our dining-room table and stop, thinking I heard our ghosts sitting and around talking to one another, saying stuff.  _________28.  We can infer that as a child, Ellerbee

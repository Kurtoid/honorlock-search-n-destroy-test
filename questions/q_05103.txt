In this circuit, a Zener diode BZX55C15 with the Zener voltage of 15 V is used. This Zener diode requires a minimum current of 1 mA to operate in the breakdown region and its maximum power dissipation rating is 500 mW. What are the minimum and maximum values of the load resistance RL in order to properly operate this circuit as a voltage regulator?    Question#2 - [10 points]: The parameters of NPN transistor in the common-emitter amplifier circuit shown below are: VT = 25.8 mV and |VA| = 200 V. If VBE = 0.7 V and bF = 100, determine:  the DC-biasing parameters: IB, IC, and VCE [5 points] the small-signal model parameters: gm, rp and ro [1.5 points] the small-signal amplifier parameters: Ri, Ro and Avo [1.5 points] the output voltage VL [2 points]     Question#3 - [10 points]: The parameters of n-channel enhancement MOSFET in the common-source amplifier circuit shown below are:          Threshold voltage: Vt = 1 V MOS constant: Kn = 0.25 mA/V2 Channel modulation voltage: |Vm| = 200 V           Find DC-biasing parameters: drain current iD, gate-to-source voltage VGS, and drain-to-source voltage VDS [5 points] Calculate small-signal AC parameters: gm, ro and mg [1.5 points] Determine the small-signal amplifier parameters: Ri, Ro and Avo [1.5 points] Determine the output voltage VL across the load RL if VS = 1 mVpp [2 points]  VDD = 15 V, RD= 2.2kO, R1=150 kO, R2 = 150 kO, RS1 = 1 kO, Rs= 10 O, RL= 100kO, C1=C2=CS=very large     Upload your pdf file below:

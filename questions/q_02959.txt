Silver ions can be precipitated from aqueous solutions by the addition of aqueous carbonate:             2  AgNO3 (aq) + Na2CO3 (aq)  -  Ag2CO3(s) + 2 NaNO3 (aq)   Silver carbonate is virtually insoluble in water so that the reaction appears to go to completion. How many grams of Na2CO3 must be added to 25.0 mL of 0.366 M AgNO3 solution to completely precipitate the silver?    (If you wish, show your work for possible partial credit.)

Researchers investigated the orientation or direction-finding abilities of sea turtle hatchlings under varying magnetic conditions. Hatchlings were placed in a tank of water in a laboratory either in the natural magnetic field of the earth OR in a reversed magnetic field in which north and south were flipped. The researchers then measured the direction that the hatchlings swam. The experiments were carried out in the dark and at night since that is when most newly hatched turtles migrate from their sandy nests into the ocean.

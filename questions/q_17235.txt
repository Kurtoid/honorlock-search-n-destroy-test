INSTRUKSIES         1.   Jy word met  'n saamgeperste leer (zip file) voorsien. Regskliek op die knoppie hieronder om in 'n nuwe oortjie te open.   Laai die leer af en 'unzip' die leer; herbenoem die leergids met jou naam en van. Maak die toetsprojek in Delphi  oop. Jy sal die hele toets in hierdie projekvouer afle.         2.   Lees die vrae deeglik deur en moenie meer doen as wat gevra word nie.         3.   Probeer jou program saamstel (compile) en uitvoer (run). Dit beteken soms dat daar kommentaar op kodering sal wees. Jou kommentaar sal steeds gemerk word.         4.   Indien daar kodering is wat met kommenaar uitgehaal word, en ander wat nie is nie, sal die kodering sonder kommentaar gemerk word.      5.   Lees eers die hele vraag deur voordat jy met die kodering begin.         6.   Stoor u Delphi-leers as u klaar is. Klik op die stuurknoppie. (OF as hierdie vasvra outomaties ingedien word omdat u tyd opraak, STOP kodering en stoor.). 'n Tweede vasvra sal beskikbaar wees, maak dit oop. (Dit moet binne vyf minute na die indiening van hierdie vasvra gedoen word). Dan het u 10 minute tyd om u VOUER van u projek te zip en die leer in die nuwe vasvra op te laai. Daardie vasvra sal die punte kry as u toets nagesien is.

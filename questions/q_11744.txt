You are investigating the genetics of a species of violets.  In this species, flower petal color displays incomplete dominance:  flower petals are either white, dark purple, or light purple. In one field of violets, you count a sample of 100 flowers, and get the following results: 40 white flowers                    30 light purple flowers                      30 dark purple flowers A) Calculate the allele frequencies in this field.   B) Based on these allele frequencies, what genotype frequencies would you expect to find out of a population of 100 lilacs?   C) You observe this field every day, to try to determine why your observed genotype frequencies don't match what you expect. You notice that bees (which pollinate these violets) seem to visit white flowers and dark purple flowers twice as frequently as they visit light purple flowers. Based on this information, calculate the allele frequencies you would expect to see in the next generation.  Show all work.

Questions 6 - 11 refer the following information. Collectively, this questions are worth 30 points. Consider the regressions in the table below. These regressions were estimated using the data from the March 1999 CPS on hourly earnings in 1998.  Standard errors are given in parentheses under coefficients, and p-values (for the regression) are given in parentheses under F-statistics.  Individual coefficients are statistically significant at the *5% or **1% significance level. (The Northeast is the omitted region).  Regression Models of Hourly Earnings Dependent variable: log hourly earnings; 37,810 observations.     Regressor   (1)   (2)   (3)     Years of education (

Scenario 9.4 Consider the following data for an independent-demand item maintained by Vicki Crittenden, the proprietor of a local auto repair shop:   Weekly demand = 50 units Ordering cost = $8/order Holding cost = $4/unit/year Weeks in a year = 50     Use the information in Scenario 9.4. Due to new ordering procedures initiated by Crittenden, the ordering cost is dropping to $4 per order. At the same time, the weekly demand increases to 64 units per week due to an increase in business. What effect do these changes have on the EOQ quantity for this item?

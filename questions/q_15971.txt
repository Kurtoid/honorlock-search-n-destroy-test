BONUS: Suppose scientists find a population of animals in the forest that have never been described before.  When a group of these animals were brought into the lab for detailed study, they found that the animals had all the characteristics of a mammal, such as fur, milk production and giving birth to live young.  However, surprisingly, the scientists report that these animals exhibit Alternation of Generations similar to plants! How might this work?  Describe how this animal might produce gametes-by mitosis or meiosis?  Would the diploid or haploid generation be dominant?  Would there be spores? Would there be seeds?

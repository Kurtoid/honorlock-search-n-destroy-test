A patient has a chest-tube inserted because of  a pneumothorax. One hour after the client's chest-tube is inserted, repeat arterial blood gases (ABGs) are done and the results are: pH:                           7.35 PaCO2                       51 mmHg HCO3                         29 mEq/L PaO2                           85 mmHg These results are compared to the ABG drawn earlier: pH:                             7.33 PaCO2                        55 mmHg HCO3                          22mEq/L PaO2                            78 mmHg What would a comparison of the two ABGs indicate to the nurse about the client's condition?

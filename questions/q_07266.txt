Women tend to have more frequent urinary tract infections compared to men.  Which of the following is not a reason why?
Parasitism B. Suppose the researchers conducted an experiment to investigate whether other species of defensive symbionts can protect fruit flies from the nematode parasite (Howardula). In the first experiment, they screened for beneficial symbiotic bacteria by searching for species similar to Spiroplasma bacteria.  They established a large population of fruit flies and exposed them to a nematode parasite. Then they separated the fruit fly individuals into two treatment groups: those without parasite (Howardula) and those with parasite (Howardula). They screened (looked) one of seven species of symbionts (A-G). The results are shown in Table 1 below.  Table 1. Percentage of Fruit Fly Individuals with Different Species of Symbionts         Bacterial Species       Treatment   A   B   C   D   E   F   G     Howardula absent   50   40   80   30   50   95   30     Howardula present   50   90   10   30   75   95   96     B. How many bacterial species appear to be a defensive symbiont species? Explain (what evidence do you have). (3pts)

Validity Multi-Part: J. Crew collaborated with a marketing research consulting firm to design a new store layout that groups products differently than the current store layouts. In January 2020, they launched the new layouts in 40 randomly selected stores and choose 40 randomly selected stores to serve as the control with the plan to compare sale prior to the website launch to sales after the website launch in both the treatment and control group.  In February 2020, a pandemic swept the globe shifting how people naturally shopped and in the middle of the experimental period.

Qiao and colleagues (2011) explored the relationship of stress, coping, and psychological well-being in new graduate nurses. They ran a regression to identify which independent variables were predictors of psychological well-being in new graduate nurses. They reported: "Denial as coping strategies (r = -.37, p < .05) and death and dying as workplace stressor (r = -.23, p < .05) were the best negative predictors of psychological well-being"  What do the reported statistics for denial (r = -.37, p < .05) tell you?

DIRECTIONS:  You will have 90 min from the start of this exam to complete it. Note that with this exam software I can only randomize answers for ALL questions (not individual questions), so for questions that have ABCD types of responses, the answers are still randomized, so make sure to find the correct one.  I tried to label as clearly as possible.  Don't talk about or post about the exam until Prof. Losego says it is ok to do so (honor code violation).  Piazza should be shut down for the 24 hr period of the exam to reduce inadvertent posting. For this exam, you are allowed a pencil/pen and a blank sheet of paper to work out problems.  You are NOT allowed a calculator nor any other notes, books, or other reference materials (written nor web-based).   You are only allowed to use the electronic device on which you are taking this exam.  Do NOT use headphones; I can't tell what you are listening to. You only get 1 submission! So make sure you are finished when you submit.  Choose the BEST answer!

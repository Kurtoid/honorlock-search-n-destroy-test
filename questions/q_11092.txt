These questions are from the discretionary and mandatory access control module.  All students in a class belong to a group G and are able to access class resources because G is granted the necessary permissions. Assume Alice has tested out of a topic and does not need to take the quiz on this topic. The professor does not want Alice to have access to this quiz but wants Alice to remain in group G so she can access other resources. Also, the professor wants to grant access to the quiz to all other students by granting the desired access to G. The mechanisms provided by various operating systems can be used to meet this access control requirement. Explain how this can be achieved most efficiently and correctly in Linux with extended access control lists (EACLs) and in Windows.  (5+5  pts.)

Is this policy correctly implemented by this scheme? Provide a brief justification for your answer. (5 pts.)

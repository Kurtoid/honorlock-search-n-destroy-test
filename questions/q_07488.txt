A special-purpose fluid flows at 4 x 10-2 kg/s inside a 1 cm diameter tube that is heated electrically at a constant rate of 50 W/m.  At a specific location where the flow and heat transfer are fully developed, the wall temperature is 400 K.  At this location, calculate the mean temperature of the fluid.  The fluid has the following properties: thermal conductivity = 0.125 W/m*K, density = 875 kg/m3, kinematic viscosity = 40x10-6 m2/s, and specific heat = 2120 J/kg*K.

CASE ONE: Your third patient this morning, Bruce Springs, is a 52-year-old male. He was seen last week for an initial examination. He has not received dental or dental hygiene care in approximately seven years. At his visit last week it was determined that he has class III periodontitis and moderate to heavy calculus deposits and requires four quadrants of periodontal debridement with anesthesia. The patient reluctantly agreed to this treatment plan and today is five minutes late for his 10:00 a.m. appointment. You greet Bruce in the reception area and accompany him to the operatory. You review his medical history and perform an intra/extra oral examination and find no significant findings or contraindications to treatment.His vital signs are within normal limits although slightly elevated, which you attribute to his anxiety (pulse 88, respirations 16, blood pressure 138/88). Reviewing his personal oral hygiene seems to place him at ease. You prepared the anesthetic syringe prior to his arrival and approach him with the topical anesthetic on a cotton tipped applicator.You notice that he has become quite pale and the hairs on his arms are standing up. He is beginning to sweat profusely and frequently yawns. You ask him if he is feeling well and he states that he is fine, just a little nervous and a bit dizzy. You pick up the syringe and notice that he has lost consciousness. From what emergency do you suspect Bruce is suffering?
Which disease or syndrome is associated with signs that develop slowly?

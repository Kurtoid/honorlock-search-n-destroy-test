Homozygous females phenotypically a, c were crossed with homozygous males phenotypically b. The F1 females were all wild-type in appearance and the F1 males were all a, c double mutants. The F1 females and males were crossed to give the following F2 phenotypes and numbers:           Number of         Males   Females     a+c   272   310     +b+   268   0     ab+   157   0     ++c   163   190     abc   59   0     +++   61   295     a++   8   205     +bc   12   0     Total   1000   1000        Draw a genetic map showing the order of the genes and the distances between them.

evaluate the expression used to calculate the desired nozzle pressure of a fire hose: p + g - f for each given values p, g, and f. Round each answer to the nearest hundredth. p = [p]g = [g]f = [f]
Injury to the reticular formation can result in which of the following?
Larry presented an informative speech on earthquakes in his science class. He described the structural causes of earthquakes, how they develop, which areas of the earth are prone to quakes, how quakes are measured, the damage they do, and what to do when one hits. The speech became dry, the audience's attention declined, and Larry's speech exceeded the time limit by three minutes. From this description, what was Larry's mistake?

To answer this question, you will need the Table that follows this question on the next slide. For the following nucleotide sequence of DNA:                                                               TACGATCAGATT     1.  Give the complementary sequence of DNA for the opposite strand of the double helix:   [sequence1]     2.  Give the sequence of mRNA that would be transcribed from the strand I gave you at the top.    [sequence2]      3.  List the first codon of the mRNA sequence.  [sequence3]      4.  Translate the entire mRNA sequence (from question 2) into the amino acid sequence of the protein using the genetic code table found on the following slide.  [sequence4]  Read your mRNA strand left-to-right. 5.  For the same sequence of DNA at the top that I gave you, mutate the DNA at the 4th position (the 1st  G from the left) by carrying out any point mutation. Write the mutated DNA sequence in the box provided.   [sequence5] 6.  Give the sequence of mRNA that would be transcribed from the mutated strand of DNA that you just made:  [sequence6] 7.  Translate your mutated mRNA sequence listed above into the amino acid sequence of your protein, by using the genetic code table found on the following slide. Read your mRNA strand left-to-right. [sequence7] Be sure to read your mRNA strand left-to-right when answering all of the questions.

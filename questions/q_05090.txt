QUESTION 3          Open the project characterOOPs_p in the Question3 Folder.    3.1) Create TDnDChar class. Save it in the clsDnDChar unit within the project. Below is the UML diagram and some more details are given in the instructions which follow.     TDnDCharacter    - sName : String    - iExperiencePoints : Integer    - iStrength : Integer       + constructor create( sName,  iStrength)    + setExperiencePoints(iNum:Integer)    + getExperiencePoints : Integer    + getStrength : Integer    + toString : String     (5)   3.1.a) The constructor accepts 2 parameters to set the sName and iStrength instance variables. It must set the iExperiencePoints to 0.  (4)              3.1.b) setExperiencePoints is a mutator method. (2)           3.1.c) getExperiencePoints and getStrength are accessor methods. (4)           3.1.d) toString must return a string in the following format:sName EX - iExperiencePoints S - iStrength (3)            3.2.a) Add your classes unit to the uses class on the form frmChar. (1)           3.2.b) Declare a global variable of your class type. (1)           3.2.c) Create the button Create (btnCreate) click procedure:It must instantiate your global variable using the values from the edits on the form. (4)           3.2.d) Create the button Round (btnRound) click procedure: It must increase the ExperiencePoints by 2.  (3)           3.2.e) Create the button fight (btnFight) click procedure: It must get a random number between 1 and 6 and if the iStrength of the global variable object is greater than the random number, display the word WIN in the label lblOutCome otherwise display the word LOST.  (8)      TOTAL FOR QUESTION 3   [35]

(6+2+2) Points Submit a response below and write it on your paper as well. Population-growth dynamics are important in a variety of planning studies for areas such as transportation and water-resource engineering. One of the simplest models of such growth incorporates the assumption that the rate of change of the population p is proportional to the existing population at any time t:     where K is a constant (growth rate per year). This model makes intuitive sense because the greater the population, the greater the number of potential parents. At time t = 0, an island has a population of 5000 people.   If K = 0.055 per year, employ Euler's method to predict the population at t = 3 years, using a step size of 0.5 year. Also, solve the differential equation analytically by integrating. Plot p versus t approximately using both numerical and analytical methods.

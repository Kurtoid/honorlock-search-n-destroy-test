Firm 1 produces q1 units of output and firm 2 produces q2 unit of output. Thus, total output in the market is Q = q1 + q2. Market demand is given by the function P(Q)=360-0.2Q, and firms have constant marginal (and average) cost of $60 for firm 1 and $36 for firm 2. Thus, firms' total cost functions are C1(q1) = 60q1 and C2(q2) = 36q2. Answer the following questions and be sure to show all work.  How much will firm 1 produce in the Cournot equilibrium? How much will firm 2 produce in equilibrium? What is the Cournot equilibrium market output? What is the Cournot equilibrium price? How much profit will firm 1 earn? How much profit will firm 2 earn?

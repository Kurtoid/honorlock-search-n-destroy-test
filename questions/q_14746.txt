Object A has a mass of 1 kg and has a velocity v-iA{"version":"1.1","math":"v-iA"}  = (2 m/s)i^{"version":"1.1","math":"i^"} + (2 m/s)j^{"version":"1.1","math":"j^"} and object B has a mass of 2 kg and has a velocity v-iB{"version":"1.1","math":"v-iB"} = (-1 m/s)i^{"version":"1.1","math":"i^"} + (5 m/s)j^{"version":"1.1","math":"j^"}.

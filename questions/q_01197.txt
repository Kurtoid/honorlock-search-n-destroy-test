(Graduate students only and extra credit for undergraduate students) A 4-DOF robot frame is shown below (not symbolic diagram). Complete the table of Denavit-Hartenberg parameters and obtain the final position (x4, y4, z4) of the end-effector. Assume: 1) All angles are integer multiples of p/2, 2) all length dimensions di  , ai >= 0; and 3) all joint angles are in the range p > thi  >= - p (note upper limit).             Fill out the D-H parameter table based on the given conventions and rotations:     i   thi  di ai ai    0   --   --   [a0]   [alpha0]     1   [theta1]   [d1]   [a1]   [alpha1]     2   [theta2]   [d2]   [a2]   [alpha2]     3   [theta3]   [d3]   [a3]   [alpha3]     4   [theta4]   [d4]   --   --       Use the following D-H parameter conventions (modified version):  thi: angle between xi-1 and xi about zi di: min distance between xi-1 and xi along zi ai: min distance between zi and zi+1 along xi ai-1: angle between zi-1 and zi about xi-1

A forest landowner considers investing in a pine plantation that will be managed for sawtimber. However, a specific amount of return cannot be assured with full certainty because it is expected that prices will vary in the future and affect thinning and final harvest revenue. In addition, adverse events such as storms, pests and fire can also decrease the projected revenues. A detailed probability distribution and corresponding NPVs are as follow:      Probability (%)   Predicted NPV ($)     5   -15,000.00     25   10,000.00     35   [a].00     20   50,000.00     15   [b].00       Calculate the expected Net Present Value E(NPV) for this pine plantation investment. Please, do not include units in your answer.

Answer ONE of the following. Suggested time: 1 hour, 45 minutes. Make sure to label your answer to match the corresponding question using number and letter (III-A, III-B, III-C or III-D). III-A. Classes on zoom. Extended family holiday celebrations on zoom.  Meetings on zoom. Happy hour on zoom. Study group on zoom. Graduation on zoom. People are zoomed out--especially graduate students.  Professors worry about the effects of zoom overload, decreasing students' ability to absorb the complexity of the material they are teaching... or perhaps even stay awake till the end of class. (To be honest, professors are also finding that they are not at their most scintillating in this new medium and they watch their course evaluations tank.) Alarmed by this phenomenon, President Bailey turns to TC's Institute for Psychological Science and Practice (IPSP) which assembles crack team of psychologists to address the problem.  The professors meet (over zoom) to consider strategies to counter zoom fatigue and come up with three: physical exercise, listening to music, clips from a YouTube comedy channel. They then recruit 400 volunteer masters and doctoral students to participate in their experiment.  Before beginning, the participants fill out the MAT (mental agility test), a simple 10-item measure of accuracy and speed in cognitive processing. The participants also fill out a demographic sheet with their age, gender, degree program (doctoral, masters) degree area, and years in program. The research team then divides the participants into 8 groups of 50: 2 exercise groups, 2 music groups, 2 YouTube Groups and 2 control groups.  All participants will be following an asynchronous four-hour zoom lecture about a neutral topic (techniques used to harvest wheat across the ages). One of each type of group (i.e., exercise group, music group, YouTube group, and control group) is told to take a 20-minute break after 2 hours, perform its assigned activity, then finish the lecture.  The other set of groups is told to take a 10-minute break after every1 hour, perform its assigned activity, and then resume the zoom lecture. As each participant finishes, they complete an exam based on the lecture (on Canvas).  After the lecture, each participant fills out the MAT a second time. Discuss:  potential predictor and criterion variables, the experimental design or designs that the IPSP consultants might employ and the statistics they could use. Are there aspects of this study that are: within subjects? between subjects?  State at least three hypotheses that this study could test and what statistical results would provide confirmation for each. Suggest one potential moderator or mediator.   III-B.  Most students take notes during lecture and study their notes for exams. You are interested in investigating the independent effects of taking notes versus taking and studying/reviewing notes on test performance. You would also like to know if their effects (taking notes vs taking and studying notes) on test performance changes with age. You have been given permission by a large, local school district to study this issue with their 5th, 8th, and 12th grades. Design a study to address your questions. In your answer, please address the following:  What design would you use? Why? Define what is meant by a between-subjects variable and a within-subjects variable. Identify your independent and dependent variables and label them as between- or within- subjects. What subject matter content will you use, and why? What are your hypotheses? Describe the setting and the participants. Operationalize your independent and dependent variables. What would your results look like, both graphically and in words?    III-C. You wish to investigate if a specific educational intervention can make middle school students more resilient and persistent in the face of failure.  You intend to test this idea using a study in which teams of middle-school students try to design a successful pizza takeout business.  Students design the pizza menu (by choosing five pizzas to offer from a set of 25), set prices, and make advertising decisions (with a limited budget).  They then get feedback on the success of their business.  They try this for six sessions, on successive days.  The simulation is designed so that students will fail the first four times they try - this can be arranged because which pizzas and which advertising methods succeed can be arbitrarily set. Complete the design of this study, specifying what will happen on the last two sessions, if more than one condition will be used, etc.  How will attitude and persistence in the face of failure be measured? How will your intervention be tested?  How many subjects will be needed?  What types of statistical analysis will you need to perform to analyze the results?   III-D. You are interested in examining the influence of the messages that leaders convey about their mindsets regarding the fixedness or malleability of intelligence on employee motivation and performance.  Fixed mindset beliefs are characterized by the idea that intelligence is static and can't be changed.  Growth mindset beliefs are characterized by the idea that intelligence is malleable and can be developed.  You have a hunch that there are certain situations where having a leader who conveys a growth mindset will lead to higher motivation and performance than having a leader who conveys a fixed mindset and there are other situations where leader mindset will have less of an influence on motivation and performance.  Design an experiment to explore these issues.  Please answer the following questions in your write up.  What experimental design would you use? Why?  Identify your independent variable, dependent variable, moderator variable, and mediator variable. What are your hypotheses? Describe the setting and the participants. Operationalize your independent, dependent, moderator, and mediator variables. What would your results look like (both graphically and in words) if you were successful in identifying a moderator variable? What statistical procedures would you use to establish the significance of this finding? What would your results look like (both graphically and in words) if you were successful in identifying a mediator variable? What statistical procedure would you use to establish the significance of this finding?

At age 22, Ryan is considering contributing $5,500 per year to a Roth IRA for the next 40 years until he retires at age 62. Contributions will be made at the end of the year (ordinary annuity). Because Ryan wants to retire at such a young age, he plans to invest the money aggressively and hopes to make a 10% return on his investment. Because money is tight after graduation, Ryan is considering not beginning the annual contributing to his Roth IRA until age 32. How much more money should Ryan expect to have in his Roth IRA when he retires at age 62 if he starts contributing at age 22 instead of 32? Tables: Time Value of Money Tables-1.pdf

Combustions (Canvas Q6) In Ch. 4.5, we discussed complete combustions, in which all carbon contained in a compound is converted to CO2. The complete combustion of methane (natural gas) is shown below. CH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) - CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g) However, in low-oxygen conditions (such as when a generator is run indoors for long periods of time), an incomplete combustion occurs instead, where the carbon content is converted to CO. Incomplete combustions are not ideal: carbon monoxide is highly toxic and can cause severe injury or even death (this is one reason why you should never run a generator indoors!). The incomplete combustion of methane is shown below. CH4 (g) + 3/2 O2 (g) - CO (g) + 2 H2O (g) Consider a furnace that is being used to heat a home up via the combustion of methane. From a thermochemical perspective, which combustion reaction is more efficient at heat production: the complete combustion, or the incomplete combustion? Briefly explain and justify your choice (using complete sentences) in the context of DHdegf and q. Optional: You may use the scratch space in the Handwritten Pages to draw a diagram or write some equations to supplement your answer if it makes your explanation clearer or demonstrate your argument. Make sure to say that you've included stuff in the scratch space, or else I won't know to check it! ( Scratch )

Now let's look at real chemical equations. When we heat KClO3, we can make oxygen gas: 2 KClO3 --> 2 KCl + 3 O2. If we heat 2 mol KClO3, how many grams of KCl and O2 will be produced theoretically? (keep 4 significant figures for all the numbers)   Step 1: Molar mass of KCl: [1] g/mol Molar mass of O2: [2] g/mol Step 2: Produced KCl: [3] g Produced O2: [4] g

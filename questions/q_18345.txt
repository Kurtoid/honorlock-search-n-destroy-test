The Law of LaPlace can be used to describe how stress is controlled through the movement of circumferential smooth muscle of the arterial wall, whereby the stress is directly related to the width of the wall.
[10%]   2.         Directly implement the below equation with a mixed-logic circuit diagram, i.e., do NOT simplify the equation. Use only gates of the type shown here (or its mixed-logic equivalent).  Minimize the total number of gates.  The E signal must be active-low. You are free to choose all other activation levels in order to optimize your solution.  Check twice that you correctly read the equation!

Which of the following cardiovascular changes is most commonly associated with all mu agonist opioids?
SUMMARIZE THE EVENTS OF ACTION POTENTIALS An action potential (AP) begins when a [threshold] large enough to reach threshold occurs. During the depolarization phase of AP, [gate1]-[ion1] channels open, allowing [ion2] to diffuse rapidly [direction1].  This causes a [effect1]. The repolarization phase of AP begins when [gate2]-[ion3] channels close as simultaneously [gate3]-[ion4] channels open.  This allows [ion5] to diffuse rapidly [direction2].  This causes the membrane to [effect2]. The after-hyperpolarization phase occurs because the [gate4]-[ion6] channels are slow to close, so that RMP is only restored after they do so.

You are now a prisoner faced with a dilemma.  You must choose to either keep the 4 points for this question for yourself or donate 0.222 points to the class pool.  The total amount of points you will receive is the sum of the pool points plus the amount you have kept for yourself.  For example, assume your classmates (37 total students, that's you plus 36 others) donate 3.77 points to the pool ( 17 of the 36 other people donate).  If you choose to donate your 0.222 points to the pool also, you will get 3.99 points; however, if you keep your 4 points then you will receive 7.77  points.  The maximum you can receive is 12.0 points and the minimum is 0.222 points.  Like all questions on this exam, this question accounts for 4 of the total 100 possible exam points.

An exporter must decide which of three products to market in North America, Potatoes (P1), Pineapples (P2), or Popcorn (P3).  The success of each product will depend on what happens with new legislation that the US Congress will pass after the election next year.  The exporter believes three possible outcomes of the legislation are possible, L1, L2, or L3.   The decision situation has been summarized into the following payoff table, which shows the estimated profits associated with various strategies available to the decision-maker that are estimated to occur under three different scenarios for factors out of the decision-makers control.  Assume P1 = strategy to market product P1, etc., L1 = Legislative outcome L1, etc. and probabilities of events occurring are as shown.                Probability          .5         .4         .1          L1        L2        L3P1     $50     $100     $30P2   $100       $40     $70P3     $20       $50     $60What product should be selected to according to the EMV criteria:

Assume the market for computers in a small open economy (SOE) is given by the following:                         Demand:  x =  60,000 - 10P                                         Supply:  y = 30P - 20,000 a) Calculate the autarky price in the SOE and derive the equation for their import demand curve. If the world price of computers is equal to PW = 800, how many computers will they import. b)  If the SOE imposes a quota on computers such that imports are limited to Mbar = 30,000, how would this affect the price of computers in the SOE. Calculate the tariff equivalence of the quota and the change in welfare in the SOE due to the quota (compared with welfare under free trade).

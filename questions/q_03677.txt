New Trends in Dining Out: A sampling of what is new and unusual in the restaurant business      Nowadays, dining out is about so much more than eating. Restaurants are seeking to add to the dining experience in many different ways, challenging our preconceived notions of the way food is ordered and even how--and whether--to pay for it. Fiona Hawley looks at some of the latest trends in dining. Waiters Need Not Apply      What if you could have a restaurant without waiters or serving people? This is the situation at 's Baggers Restaurant in Nuremberg, Germany. Customers order food by touching video screens at the table. The food is delivered to the table on a complex system of metal rails. Diners pay by touching the screen at their table or by punching a few numbers into their cell phones. There are no waiters or servers on the floor at all.      The kitchen is on the upper floor of a remodeled industrial building. The dining room, a spacious, loft-like area, is directly below. Chefs in the kitchen prepare dishes such as "organic beef in buttermilk" and place them on rails that lead to each table. The computer system tells diners how long the food will take to arrive.      According to owner Michael Mack, the aim is to save on service costs. He points out that shoppers can now do their own checkout at the supermarket and travelers can check themselves in at the airport. By eliminating the wages of waiters at a restaurant, it is possible to buy higher quality food and offer it at a lower price.      Mack is exhorting other restaurant owners to see the light and follow suit. Local waiters may be reluctant to agree. Pay What You Want      A more philanthropic trend is catching on in several locations around the world: restaurants where diners decide how much they want to eat and how much they want to pay. The One World Cafe in Salt Lake City is one example. The guiding principle is that anyone who is hungry should be able to eat good healthy food.      At the One World Cafe, there is no set menu, but the restaurant is dedicated to serving fresh food and local produce, made from scratch. The dishes have familiar names: pizza, vegetable soup, and quiche. The clientele is diverse: attorneys, school teachers, and soccer moms sit next to homeless people. When considering how much to pay, customers are advised to consider three questions: How much did you eat? What would you pay somewhere else? And how much can you afford?      While customers sometimes leave without paying, the vast majority do pay for their food and often donate a little extra. Those who cannot pay work in the kitchen and are given food vouchers to redeem later. Because people choose the amount the want to eat, very little food is wasted.      The restaurant--the owners prefer to call it a community kitchen--has been a lifesaver for some local homeless people, enabling them to eat well while saving money to improve their lives. It is popular with local residents, too, who are often willing to help with remodeling or cleaning, raise funds, or donate food from their own gardens. Owner Denise Cerreta has helped several other restaurants to set up a similar system, and pay-as-you-can restaurants have opened in Denver, New York, and other U.S. cities. Dining in the Dark      At Opaque Restaurant in San Francisco, diners are completely in the dark. There is absolutely no light in the restaurant, so you literally cannot see your hand in front of your face.      This is a scary experience for some and a challenge for all. For people who can see, it is like being blind. On entering the restaurant, customers are met by blind or partially sighted waiters who guide them to their tables and show them where to sit and how to keep track of their silverware. They order meals and check coats and bags before entering the dining room, in order not to distract from what the restaurant owners call "a sensory event in complete darkness."      It is indeed a sensory experience. Fans claim that when you can't see, your other senses become that much sharper, and textures and tastes become more defined- possibly because you are always trying to identify just exactly what that strange substance is that you're eating! Finding your water glass and cutting your food provides an additional challenge.      The food is gourmet fare, prepared by some of San Francisco's hottest chefs. The experience is one that you'll remember for a long time.

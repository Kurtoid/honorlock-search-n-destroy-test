Problem 4 (15 points) Load the file shark-attacks.csv using pandas. This file yearly total number of shark attacks and the yearly number of fatal shark attacks in the US from 2000 to 2020. Consider the sample 1 with the yearly fatal shark attacks from the first decade of 2000 (2000-2010), and sample 2 with the yearly fatal shark attach from the second decade of 2000 (2011-2020).  4.1 (2 points) Create a boxplot for these samples. 4.2 (3 points) Plot and overlay the histogram for both samples in a single plot. Use the 8 bins, and make sure both samples are using the same binning. As always, include axis labels and legend. 4.3 (2 points) Create a dataframe for each sample and compute the summary statistics for each. Compute the observed mean-difference statistic. Based on these observations, design a hypothesis test with regards to the number of fatal shark attacks for the 2 decades. 4.4. (3 points) Carry out the Bootstrap sampling for 10,000 simulations and plot the histogram of the Bootstrap resampled mean-difference statistic. For a significance value

Determine the Norton equivalent circuit as seen from terminals A and B from the figure below. Your work, including all calculations, must be typed into the answer box below.   Use the "Insert Math Equation" function.  Answers without an adequate explanation or work/calculations will receive little to no points.    It is required to organize your work clearly.  Begin by labeling the step you are taking (calculating Norton current, or calculating Norton resistance).  Explain what you are doing within each step. Use scratch paper when you need to, in order to re-frame the problem (or circuit) as you are working through it.   Then, type your work into the answer box.

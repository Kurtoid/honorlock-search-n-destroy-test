Use the following information for questions 13 and 14.  Please note: questions 13 and 14 should be considered independently of one another. You are the owner of a pharmaceutical company which makes its product (i.e., pill tablets) by processing materials through two departments: Mixing and Tablet-Making. Material is first combined into a mixture in the Mixing department and then is moved to the Tablet-Making department for further processing into individual tablets.  The company wants to streamline operations and increase operating income as quickly as possible in the short-term.  As a result, the company wants to use the theory of constraints (TOC) to guide its decision making process.  It provides the following information:     Mixing Tablet-Making   Monthly capacity (grams and tablets respectively) 300,000 400,000   Monthly production (grams and tablets respectively) 200,000 390,000   Fixed operating costs (excludes direct materials) $16,000 $39,000    Fixed operating cost (per gram and tablet respectively)  $0.08 $0.10    The Mixing department makes 200,000 grams of mixture (enough to make 400,000 tablets) because the Tablet-Making department has only enough capacity to process/produce 400,000 tablets.   All direct material costs of $156,000 are incurred at the start of the mixing process in the Mixing department.   The Tablet-Making department produces only 390,000 tablets from the 200,000 grams of mixture processed because 10,000 tablets produced are wasted/discarded during the tablet-making process (note: these tablets can not be sold).   Each sellable tablet sells for $1 and all sellable tablets produced can be sold.  There are no variable costs other than direct materials.

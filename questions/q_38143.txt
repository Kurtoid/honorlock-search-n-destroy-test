Modern roller coasters have vertical loops like the one shown in the Figure. The radius of curvature is smaller at the top than on the sides so that the downward centripetal acceleration at the top will be greater than the acceleration due to gravity, keeping the passengers pressed firmly into their seats. What is the speed of the roller coaster (in m/s) at the top of the loop if the radius of curvature there is 13.0 m and the downward acceleration of the car is 17.0 m/s2?

A 1.00 pound can of cranberry sauce is allowed to roll down a wooden ramp from rest. The ramp is 8.00 ft long and makes an angle of 35.0 degrees with the horizontal. The can is 6.50 inches tall, 4.00 inches in diameter, and has an effective moment of inertia of a solid cylinder (1/2 MR2). Calculate the linear and angular velocities of the cranberry sauce when it gets to the bottom of the ramp.

In both cases, the constants are less than 1, but the equilibrium constant for the formation of the hemiacetal from propanol is 2900 times greater than that of acetone.   a.  The values of the equilibrium constants suggests that the formation of the hemiacetals of these compounds is not favorable.  What factors make the formation of the hemiacetal disfavorable? b.  Why does propanal have a significantly larger equilibrium constant for the formation of the hemiacetal than acetone?

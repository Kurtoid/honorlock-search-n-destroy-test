A technician is given a sample of DNA from a PCR reaction, and a sample of uncut plasmid. The PCR product contains a gene of interest that the technician's supervisor wants cloned into the plasmid. The technician uses software to determine which enzymes she can use for each sample. Below is a list of restriction enzymes that cut once in the plasmid's multiple cloning site, and a list of restriction enzymes that cut on both sides of the gene of interest, but not in the gene of interest. Restriction enzymes that cut on BOTH sides of the gene of interest in the PCR product: * BamHI* EcoRI * HindIII * PstI * SacI Restriction enzymes that cut once in the plasmid's multiple cloning site: * AluI* BglI* DraI* EcoRV* HindIII Assuming all of the restriction enzyme cut sites are unique, which restriction enzyme should the technician use to digest the DNA?

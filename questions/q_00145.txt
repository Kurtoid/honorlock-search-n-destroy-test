[All solutions must start by writing an equation (or equations) from the equation sheet on your paper.  The solution must then follow a logical progression from the equation(s) on the equation sheet to the answer(s).] A 535-N skier is pulled a diagonal distance of 50 m up a slope that is 20deg above horizontal by a tow rope. The tow rope is parallel to the slope and has a magnitude of 180N.  A frictional force of 25N opposes the skier's motion.  a) Draw a work diagram for the tension and calculate the work done by the tension. b) Draw a work diagram for the normal force and calculate the work done by the normal force. c) Draw a work diagram for the friction and calculate the work done by the friction. Enter the work done by each of these three forces in the box below.  The work diagrams and calculations will be scanned and turned in immediately following the quiz.

Source 1 "German wartime propaganda [during the First World War] has been criticized on many different grounds, but its success in blaming the war on Russia was a masterstroke, mobilizing widespread Russophobia in the working classes, the people most opposed to armed conflict, and playing on the threat of invasion. As [a daily newspaper in Berlin] told its readers, 'the German people may honestly say once more in this hour that it did not want this war. . . . But it will not allow the soil of the Fatherland to be overrun and devastated by Russian regiments.' The brief occupation of East Prussian territory by Russian units at the end of August fanned fears of the so-called 'blood Tsar' and his 'Cossack hordes' further. Exaggerated atrocity stories appeared in the press and were given credibility by the letters of men serving [at the front]. Under such circumstances, it was hardly surprising that men of all classes decided that it was their patriotic duty to fight. . . . [I]n Germany, surrounded on all sides by enemies, the rush to volunteer was immediate and spontaneous. With no official encouragement, 260,672 enlistment requests were received in Prussia alone during the first week of mobilization. . . . Moreover, contrary to the usual claim [made by historians] that volunteers were 'war-enthused' students or schoolchildren, examination of muster rolls [lists of new recruits] and letters demonstrates that a broad cross-section of urban society enlisted, mainly for reasons of patriotic self-defense." Alexander Watson, British historian, Enduring the Great War, 2008     Source 2 "In Britain, the interpretation of what constituted sensitive military news and should therefore be suppressed was broad, but censorship was handled far less obtrusively [than in Germany]. Essentially, the British system consisted of a close control of news at the source by military authorities, combined with a tight-knit group of 'press lords' who . . . decided what was 'good for the country to know.' Important losses or battles often went completely unmentioned. When the [British] battleship Audacious was sunk by a mine on 27 October 1914 off the Irish coast, the loss was simply never announced. When the Battle of Jutland [a major naval engagement between British and German fleets] was under way, not one civilian knew about it. [Even when official censorship sometimes foundered], the press willingly censored itself. Why did British journalists cooperate so willingly in suppressing important news? The obvious answer is that they all belonged to the same club, whose membership also included the most powerful politicians. Publishing a casualty list (or a letter from a wounded corporal about military bungling) would have meant expulsion from the club; social ostracism apparently meant more to the newsmen than their professional duty to inform the public. The government also possessed positive incentives. In addition to breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner, and golf weekends in the company of the powerful, knighthoods and lordships were generously distributed among the press and, finally, prestigious posts in government itself. Alice Goldfarb Marquis, United States historian, "Words as Weapons: Propaganda in Britain and Germany during the First World War," article published in an academic journal, 1978            Watson, in the first paragraph of Source 1, uses the newspaper quote to support the claim that

Lee el articulo y decide si las afirmaciones son verdaderas o falsas.      Participacion social y evolucion de la sociedad.         Las sociedades no cambian sin una razon. Con frecuencia el deseo de cambiar esta motivado por razones economicas, eticas o ideologicas. La tecnologia es otra fuerza de cambio, asociada a los aspectos economicos.       Para examinar el tema del cambio social en paises de habla hispana, observemos dos ejemplos: uno historico y uno moderno. Un ejemplo historico ocurrio durante la colonia espanola, cuando se esclavizo a la mayoria de los indigenas de las colonias con el pretexto religioso de evangelizarlos. Los espanoles explotaron el trabajo de los indigenas a cambio de esa conversion religiosa. Habia razones economicas poderosas para oponerse a la liberacion de los indigenas, ya que proporcionaban enormes riquezas a los espanoles bajo esta organizacion social. Algunos testigos de los maltratos a los indigenas -- como Fray (Brother) Bartolome de las Casas -- se opusieron y documentaron los abusos, aunque sin muchos resultados en aquella epoca. Fray Bartolome de las Casas (1474?-1566) lucho fervientemente por defender a la poblacion indigena y, con su ayuda, eventualmente se limitaron los abusos a la poblacion nativa. Desafortunadamente los europeos trajeron de Africa a millones de esclavos para sustituir a los indigenas.       No todos los cambios sociales son violentos ni tienen oposicion. Un cambio tambien puede ser pacifico y deseado, particularmente en casos de emergencias. Un ejemplo de participacion social reciente se dio en Chile a partir del terremoto de febrero del 2010 -- uno de los mas fuertes en la historia de la humanidad. En este caso, cientos de jovenes se organizaron para llevar ayuda a miles de damnificados (victims). Dos jovenes instalaron una carpa (tent) de ayuda afuera de una estacion del metro. En pocas horas empezaron a recibir comida y otros articulos. Lo anunciaron en Twitter y de alli se hizo un reportaje en la television. La organizacion se consolido con la ayuda de Facebook, y en unos dias tenian a mas de 400 voluntarios para distribuir la ayuda. Cuando el gobierno de una nacion no esta preparado para hacer frente a una emergencia, la participacion social es la unica solucion. La fuerza de esta union es muy comun en la actualidad entre los jovenes de muchos otros paises, principalmente para exigir democracia, o la creacion de oportunidades justas para las nuevas generaciones.       Los cambios no son posibles sin la participacion social. Para bien o para mal, los medios de comunicacion y las redes sociales han comenzado a facilitar una participacion importante y espontanea de la poblacion. Aunque es pronto (early) para entender las repercusiones sociales de estos movimientos y de la tecnologia que los impulsa, lo que es evidente, es que sin la participacion social no hay cambios.     6 of 6.    Es pronto para saber si los medios de comunicacion y las redes sociales facilitan el cambio.

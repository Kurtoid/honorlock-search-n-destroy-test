A car is approaching a van going in the same direction on a straight, level highway. The driver of the car is distracted by their phone and is going faster than the van in the same lane, and the car runs into the back of the van. Since both drivers are wearing their seatbelts and both vehicles are equipped with airbags, neither driver is seriously injured.  Assume that neither driver had time to apply the brakes before or during the collision. Immediately after the collision the two vehicles are stuck to each other, and the wheels are still rolling. The car has mass m=1,300 kg and is moving at v=81.0 mph, and the van has mass M=3,400 kg and is moving at V=70.0 mph. Use a coordinate system where positive vectors point to the right.    a) What is the total momentum of the car and van system (in kg m/s units) before the collision? b) What is the velocity of the car/van immediately after the collision? c) What is the direction of the net force on the car during the collision? Explain in one sentence how you know this. d) What is the direction of the net force on the van during the collision? Explain in one sentence how you know this. e) Which is larger, the magnitude of the acceleration of the car, or the magnitude of the acceleration of the van?

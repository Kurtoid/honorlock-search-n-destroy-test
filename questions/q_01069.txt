EXHIBIT 2 A distributor of cycling equipment has collected weekly demand data for a specific bicycle model over the last year. The demand data and the required parameters are given in the file Final Exam_Exhibit 2_DATA.xlsm. Hint: If the demand and lead time are given in different time units, you should transform the lead time into the same time unit than the demand. All such transformations have to be done within the Excel formulas (i.e., when I ask for a formula, it has to include the relevant transformations). The company operates 365 days per year. DO NOT ADD COLUMNS OR ROWS IN THE EXCEL FILE. Important: When clicking on this link, if the file does not open you will find it in the "download" section of your browser (bottom left of the page) and you can open it from there. If it still does not open, make sure that you are not editing a formula in another Excel file (this sometimes prevents you from opening a new file). Please note that this file is protected against saving. Do not close this file until you submit the exam, otherwise you may loose its content. In case you inadvertently closed the file, please download it again.

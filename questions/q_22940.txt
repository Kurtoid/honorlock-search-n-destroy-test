The company is interested in locking in the price of the Treasuries today through a forward contract. Using the forward contract, the company is planning to invest all of the proceeds of a sale of equipment ($200M).

You enter the FRA as a payer of the fixed rate () and a receiver of the floating rate (). Both rates are semiannually compounded interest rates. What is the value of the FRA at inception (t = 0)? [answer7] Six months later (August 1, 2020 or t = 0.5), you have second thoughts and consider that maybe you should get out of the transaction. You observe the new term structure of interest rates as follows.     t T     0.5 1.0 0.965   0.5 1.5 0.930   0.5 2.0 0.905   0.5 2.5 0.885    What is the value of the FRA on August 1, 2020?[answer8]
In corn kernels, dark purple color (D) is dominant over yellow color (d) and smooth texture (T) is dominant over rough texture (t).  The gene for color is unlinked to the gene for texture, so inheritance of these traits follows Mendel's Principle of Independent Assortment.  If two doubly heterozygous plants are crossed, what proportion of the offspring would be expected to have dark purple, smooth kernels?

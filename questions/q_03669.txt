Possibly useful equations:  The table below shows the change in rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction as substrate concentration changes. A constant amount of enzyme is added to a series of reaction mixtures containing different concentrations of substrate ([S], in mM). The initial reaction rates (v, mmol/min) of substrate consumed was measured for each reaction mixture.   Blank #1: What is the approximate value of Vmax for this reaction? Include units in your answer. Blank #2: What is the approximate value of KM for this enzyme? Include units in your answer. Blank #3: What is the initial rate (in mmol/min) at [S] = 1 mmol/L? Blank #4: Suppose that the enzyme concentration in each reaction mixture is increased by a factor of 4. Will the value of KM for this enzyme interacting with this substrate increase, decrease, or stay the same?

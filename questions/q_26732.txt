A local vegan burger food truck needs help understanding different aspects of their operations. The food truck is open from 12-7pm daily. Customers arrive to the food truck according to Poisson process at a rate of 20 customers per hour from 12-2pm, 14 customers per hour from 2-5pm, and 30 customers per hour 5-7pm.  The food truck serves three types of burgers. To prepare a burger, it most likely takes 5 minutes, a minimum of 3 minutes, and a maximum of 7 minutes. Customers place an order with the cashier then travel 6 meters to pick up their food once it is ready. The time is takes to place an order is uniformly distributed with a minimum of 1 minute and maximum of 3 minutes. There is one cashier and two food servers/cooks. Once customers receive their food, they depart. A Simio model was developed to model customer flow between 5-7pm. The model was run with 10 replications for 2 hours and a 5-hour warm-up period.  What is an appropriate expression to use in Simio to model the interarrival time from 12-2pm? Note: Assume a time units of minutes.

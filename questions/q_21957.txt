ASC 740-10 (FIN 48), uncertain tax positions applies to all entities following GAAP for fiscal years beginning after 15 Dec 2006. It also applies to all positions taken on current or previous returns, tax positions for future returns if reflected on the current financial statements, and tax positions not taken.

In the past there was some controversy among biologists about whether Neanderthals should be placed within the same species as modern humans, or into a separate species of their own. At that time most DNA sequence data indicated that there was probably little or no gene flow between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. Which species concept is most applicable in this example?
A piping system that routes individual dedicated piping to each fixture is a(n)

Pick another of the following prompts based off of The Gene: An Intimate History, clearly indicate which prompt was selected, and answer completely in the space provided below. 1) Why does the author describe a virus as "a professional gene carrier"? (Hint: What is a virus's structure and its function/purpose?) What particular trait/characteristic of the SV40 virus made it so interesting and useful to scientists Paul Berg and Peter Lobban? For what purpose / what kind of experiments did they use the SV40 virus? 2) The following quote is from The Gene: An Intimate History: "... Where might a scientist find enzymes that would cut and paste DNA? The answer, as so often in the history of genetics, came from the bacterial world." Describe these "cut and paste" enzymes that came from bacteria (i.e., why do bacteria have them? What are they called? How do they work?) Additionally, give one or two other examples (besides these "cut and paste" enzymes) of "answer[s]... in the history of genetics [that] came from the bacterial world." 3) Frederick Sanger first developed the ability to "read" a DNA sequence. However, he did not start out working with DNA, but rather, with proteins. What was the important protein that Sanger sequenced for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1958? Why was the process of determining a DNA sequence so different from determining a protein sequence - i.e., how did Sanger determine protein sequences, and how did he have to adapt his methods to sequence DNA? 4) In 1974, the "Berg letter" ran in Nature, Science, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, calling for a "moratorium" on certain experiments with recombinant DNA - specifically: "Don't put toxin genes into E. coli. Don't put drug-resistant genes into E. coli, and don't put cancer genes into E. coli" until regulations could be agreed upon and implemented. Explain the reasons behind this letter (what dangers were some scientists concerned about regarding recombinant DNA experiments?) and provide and briefly explain a current or more recent example of a similar situation in which the capabilities of genetic technology made a significant leap forward, leading to a call for scientists to voluntarily pause their research until after regulations could be agreed upon and established. 5) Discuss the Asilomar Conference of 1975 (Asilomar II): What were the arguments on each side regarding recombinant DNA technology and gene cloning? What was the outcome of this conference? What was so unique about this conference and its outcome? (Hint: The book compares it to the letter written by Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard warning President Roosevelt of the potential threat of Germany developing an atomic bomb, which led to the Manhattan project and eventual development of the atomic bomb by the U.S.) 6) What was the first human protein to be manufactured (and patented) using recombinant DNA technology? Why was this protein chosen for this first attempt? What was the second human protein that Genentech and Genetics Institute each raced to produce first? Why was there a need for this protein to be manufactured? 7) The Gene: An Intimate History lists four important ideas that Victor McKusick recognized by investigating and categorizing genetic diseases. List and briefly explain his four significant insights. 8) Compare and contrast neo-eugenics (or "newgenics") with the original concept of eugenics. How were the two concepts similar? What were some differences between them? What were some of the arguments posed by critics against newgenics? Additionally, briefly explain and discuss "negative eugenics" and "positive eugenics". 9) Briefly explain how Nancy Wexler and her colleagues identified the gene responsible for Huntington's disease. Why was Wexler interested in Huntington's disease in particular? Where did she go to investigate the disease, and why? How did this help in the identification of the gene? 10) List and briefly explain at least three of the motivations behind sequencing the entire human genome. Additionally, generally compare and contrast Craig Venter's methods and attempt to sequence the human genome at his company Celera with those of the Human Genome Project headed up by Francis Collins.
The economic impact is often the only factor considered by the tourism industry, which shifts the cost to the local environment and its inhabitants.
What does cor pulmonale refer to?
So that it will appear on Honorlock's recording, before submitting my answers I have torn up my scratch paper, will not refer back to it, and will dispose of it immediately. The recordings are reviewed after the exam window closes and even after grades are posted to the transcript by the Registrar. I have complied with the FSU Honor Code.  I will NOT discuss the Pretest until Tuesday, March 16. I have NOT received any help on this exam and have NOT referred to any outside materials.

A physician ordered a medication to be given four times a day. The dosage administration schedule was 6:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 4:00 PM, and 9:00 PM. The nurse recorded the drug's administration in military time on the medication administration record (MAR). Select the correct sequence of drug administration using military time.

Cell growth liberates energy which must be removed; otherwise, the temperature will rise so much that the cells may be killed. In a continuous fermenter for the production of Penicillium chrysogenum, the cells generate 27.6 kJ/L per hour, and the volume of the well-insulated fermenter is 2.0L. The feed temperature of a coolant gas is 25oC and the exit temperature is equal to the temperature in the fermenter. Penicillium chrysogenum cannot grow above 42o Will the cell survive? Justify your answer with proper calculations. Assume for simplicity that the coolant inlet and the outlet streams have a heat capacity of 4.0 J/g/ oC and the mass flow rates of 1025 g/hr are constant. (Don't forget to draw a diagram, write down the general energy balance equation, and simplify the EB eq.) If your well-insulated fermenter were 3.0L instead, how fast will the coolant need to be flowing to ensure the cells stay alive. If you were not able to change the flow rate of the coolant (i.e., same as in #1), describe two other ways you could still maintain the temperature in the 3L fermenter below 42oC to keep the cells alive? (no math.)

Calculate the entropy of mixing when 10 g of polystyrene of molar mass of M = 25,000 g/mol is mixed with 120 g of hexane.   (Note : Molecular weight of hexane = 86 g/mol, molecular weight of styrene = 104 g/mol, the density of cyclohexane, rhaxane = 0.655 g/cm3, the density of PS, rPS = 1.06 g/cm3, and Boltzmann constant = 1.3806 x 10-23 J/K).

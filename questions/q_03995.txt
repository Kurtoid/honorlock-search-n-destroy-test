3) Closing Time. A last stage of a chemical processing facility consists of a storage vat which feeds into a series of three sequential processing steps. Each of the processing steps consists of a series of pipes through which the raw material is chemically changed as it flows through the pipes. The storage vat holds 20,000 liters; the pipes in the first processing step hold 1,000 liters; the pipes in the second processing step hold 5,000 liters; and the pipes in the third processing step hold 2,400 liters. The facility processes chemicals at a rate of 80 liters per minute. You want to estimate when the plant will shut down for the evening. The storage vat is drained at 8 p.m. (i.e., the last liter in the storage vat exits the storage vat and enters the first processing step at this time). What time will the processing facility shut down (i.e., when will the last liter exit the last processing step)?
Which structure is the primary site for oxidative phosphorylation (ETC)?
In a coffee cup calorimeter, 200.0mL of 2.50M sodium hydroxide is added to 300.0mL of 2.00M nitric acid. All of the sodium hydroxide is reacted. The temperature increases from 21.5degC to 34.4degC.  Calculate the change in enthalpy of the reaction. (The specific heat of the solution is 3.99J/gdegC and the density of the solution is 1.08g/mL. Assume that the calorimeter absorbs a negligible amount of heat.)
For the galvanic cell that uses the reaction 2 Al(s) + 3 Ni2+(aq) - 2 Al3+(aq) + 3 Ni(s)the value of n in the relationship DGdeg = -nFEdeg is ________.

Choose one of the following to answer:   a. What is span of control?  Briefly present three factors that may affect what is a manageable span of control at a given supervisory level (indicate, holding other factors constant, whether or not increases in the given factor presented tends to increase or decrease what constitutes a manageable span of control at a given supervisory level). OR b. Present a hypothetical, realistic organizational performance/effectiveness issue in either a public sector or nonprofit agency where some aspect emphasized by the Classical Administrative Management perspective plus providing for some form of worker participation (in the spirit of Human Relations/Human Resources) might both help address the situation.  Explain your answer. (Note: you may use a scenario presented in the Modules if it is relevant to this question).

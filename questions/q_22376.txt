Background For this exam, you will be predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task!  Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.  The data consists of a data frame with 4177 observations on the following 8 variables: 1. Sex: M, F, and I (infant) (categorical)2. Length: Longest shell measurement in mm (continuous)3. Diameter: Perpendicular to length in mm (continuous)4. Height: Height with meat in shell in mm (continuous)5. Whole: Weight of whole abalone in grams (continuous)6. Viscera: Gut weight (after bleeding) in grams (continuous)7. Shell: Shell weight after being dried in grams (continuous)8. Rings: Number of rings of the abalone -- corresponds with the age (discrete) Read the data Read the data and answer the questions below using the supplied R Markdown / Jupyter notebook file.  # Load relevant libraries (add here if needed)library(car)library(aod)# Read the data setabaloneFull = read.csv("abalone.csv",head=T)row.cnt = nrow(abaloneFull)# Split the data into training and testing setsabaloneTest = abaloneFull[(row.cnt-9):row.cnt,]abalone = abaloneFull[1:(row.cnt-10),] Note: Use abalone as your dataset for the following questions unless otherwise stated.

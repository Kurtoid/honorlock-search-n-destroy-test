As shown below, water flows through a venturi meter.  The pressure of the water in the pipe supports two columns of water that differ in height by 11in. The atmospheric pressure is 14.6 lbf/in2, the specific volume of water is 0.01604 ft3/lb, and the acceleration of gravity is 32.0 ft/s2.  Determine the difference in pressure between points a and b in lbf/in2. Starting with the 1st law for uniform flow-uniform state, show what happens to the pressure in the direction of the flow (i.e., increase or decrease)? Identify all assumptions.

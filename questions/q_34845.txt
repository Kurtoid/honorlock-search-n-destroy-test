Spanishfly is actually not from a fly, but from a Meloid beetle.  It is an irritant or an aphrodisiac, and was known to be used as a poison by the Marquis de Sade. The ancient Greeks knew of medicinal properties, and it is still used in veterinary medicine today.  When supply ships were cut off during the Civil War, doctors had to rely on a local "potato beetle" for treating what ailments that were commonly treated with this beetle medicine, cantharidin?

A distribution of point charges is placed on the coordinate system shown below. The axis is marked in meters. Assume the potential infinitely far from the origin is zero.   a) Calculate the electric potential due to the distribution of charges at point P, which is located at the origin. b) Find the electric potential at r= 8mi+4mj (8m, 4m) labeled as P' in the figure. c) A charge qc = -1.965x10-3 C is placed at the origin and is moved infinitely far away. What is the change in potential energy for qc. d) First of all, qc is removed from the origin. Then a charge of qd=8.65x10-7 C is placed at P'. What is the change in potential energy in moving this charge to the origin? part a) V1 =-3.182 x107 V V2 =1.659x107 V V3 =5.529 x106 V VP =-9.699x106 V part b) V1' =-3 x107 V V2' =3.996x107 V V3' =2.492 x106 V VP' =1.245 x107V part c) 11. What are the units for electric potential energy?

Jervell Lange-Nielson syndrome is a disorder characterized by deafness, a prolonged QT interval, and sudden death.  Patients harboring one pathogenic variant in the KCNQ1 gene exhibit prolonged QT intervals from childhood, whereas those with two pathogenic variants exhibit more severe disease that includes profound sensorineural deafness.  The pedigree illustrates two nuclear families that are both segregating a pathogenic variant in the KCNQ1 gene. Individuals II-2 and II-3 have not been assessed for QT prolongation, however they are expecting a child.  Which of the following options provides the best estimate of the likelihood that III-1 will be a KCNQ1 compound heterozygote?     A 1/4   B 1/9   C 1/12   D 1/16

Ligands interact with proteins in target cells, which are cells that are affected by chemical signals; these proteins are also called receptors. Ligands and receptors exist in several varieties; however, a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds only that ligand. Base your answers to the questions below on the following information: You have isolated a factor from the blood of a space alien and named it ACF (for A-Cell Factor). Based on preliminary data, you think that ACF could be one of three compounds normally found in human blood:  epidermal growth factor (EGF), epinephrine, or estrogen. You obtain two different preparations of ACF, one of which contains the receptors for ACF. You perform a binding assay and obtain a standard curve. Based upon this data, what value would reflect the affinity of the receptor for the ligand? (Assume a one ACF-to-one receptor interaction.)

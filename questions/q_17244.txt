Matthew is the manager of the customer service department for a large bookstore and cafe. The atmosphere in the store and cafe is relaxed and casual; therefore, Matthew allows employees to wear casual dress attire. The only restriction he has given workers is that they cannot wear jeans or flip-flops. One day, a waitress wears a short spaghetti-strap dress and thong-type sandals that have a heel strap. Matthew notices that a number of older customers in the cafe look disapprovingly at the waitress. He even hears one comment on how short the dress is. The waitress has been with the cafe for several months and is a reliable worker, so Matthew does not say anything to her. The next day, the same waitress arrives for her shift wearing a short white miniskirt and t-shirt of a popular rap band's most recent concert tour with profanity in its title. Again, Matthew notices that some customers seem offended by the waitress's attire. How might Matthew solve this problem?

Use this copy of the TESTING POLICY section of the COURSE SYLLABUS to answer the below questions Testing Policy The SmartBook assignments assess student knowledge and understanding at a very basic level.  The course Tests (i.e. Test 01) and Final Exam assess student knowledge, understanding, and critical thinking skills at a much deeper level than the SmartBook assignments - this means that the course Tests and Final Exam questions are typically more difficult than the SmartBook assignment questions.   All course Tests and the Final Exam are composed of 50 questions each and have a 75 minute time limit.  To acclimate students to the rigor of Test and Exam questions, Test 01 may be taken twice prior to the due date and time.  If the Test 01 is taken twice, the highest score of the two attempts will be recorded in the Canvas gradebook.  Tests 02 and 03, and the Final Exam allow only a single attempt. Questions on the course Tests and Final Exam are drawn from content presented in reading assignments and "Required Viewing" videos and animations located on the Canvas "Reading List" page for each assigned chapter. Course Test and Final Exam question formats may include multiple choice, quantitative, choose all that apply, fill in the blank, labeling, concept mapping, sequencing, ranking, matching, and case study.

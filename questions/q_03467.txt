Schematic of a VARTM layup is presented in the following figure. The fiber bed (90deg fibers) is initially compacted under vacuum (K = 4 10-11 m2) and then the resin inlet is opened to allow the resin to infuse the layup. The rheological profile of the resin at room temperature is also provided. Assume linear distribution of pressure along the length of the layup.     a) Calculate how long it takes for the resin to fully impregnate the fiber bed.  b) If the orientation of the fibers is changed to 0deg, how do you expect the infusion time to change? (no calculation required for this part). c) What happens to the infusion time if the vacuum pressure is dropped to Pgage= 0.8 atm? (no calculation required for this part).

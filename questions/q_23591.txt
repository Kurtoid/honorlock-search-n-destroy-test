Based on the article below, please identify three competitive priorities/capabilities of the company Etsy (out of the nine we learned in the course). For each of them, shortly describe (1-2 sentences) how it applies to Etsy and how it enabled them to be successful in this situation.  The following text appeared in the WSJ on 07/06/2020 (excerpts): Under normal circumstances, a $13 billion market value for an e-commerce company catering to crafters might look tremendously overvalued. Amid a pandemic, it could be a deal. Etsy, which sells everything from gemstones to garden gnomes, has morphed into the ultimate pandemic play. It is taking advantage of the growing e-commerce trend in retail, but also has adapted to become a top seller of today's most important accessory: the face mask. That product has helped catapult Etsy's sales to new highs, which could be sustained much longer than Wall Street has forecast. It also could be an attractive customer acquisition tool to sell consumers millions of items they didn't even know they needed until they happened upon them. In early April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its guidelines to recommend Americans wear face masks in public, leading to a sudden influx of consumers on Etsy's site looking for personalized versions. Etsy quickly rallied its troops, mobilizing 20,000 sellers within days of the new guidelines and 60,000 mask sellers in April as a whole, according to the company. That agility has proven to be a key advantage over competitors hamstrung by supply-chain constraints, warehouse closures and manufacturing and shipping delays. The company said it sold 12 million masks in April--17% of total gross market sales for the month--even as the broader retail market sunk. Analysis from KeyBanc shows Etsy now has a stronghold on the mask market among retailers, offering nearly a million mask selections compared with Zulily's and Walmart's several hundred each. Etsy says it acquired 4 million new customers in April alone and that 32% of mask-related purchasers that month made a subsequent purchase on the platform within 14 days. Non-mask gross-market sales grew 79% year-over-year in April, according to the company. Many of these purchases were "nesting" items like candles and gardening supplies, the company said. Sustained sales growth over the next four quarters could drive upside to Etsy's shares, even as they have touched all-time highs. Face masks aside, Etsy has shown it can quickly capitalize on new opportunities as they present themselves in the future. If nothing else, the pandemic has unmasked the potential of a marketplace many considered to be niche. At 15 years old, vintage by internet standards, Etsy has repurposed itself for mass appeal.

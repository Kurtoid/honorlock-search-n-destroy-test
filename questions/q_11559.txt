An exporter must decide which of three products to market in North America, Potatoes (P1), Pineapples (P2), or Popcorn (P3).  The success of each product will depend on what happens with new legislation that the US Congress will pass after the election next year.  The exporter believes three possible outcomes of the legislation are possible, L1, L2, or L3.   The decision situation has been summarized into the following payoff table, which shows the estimated profits associated with various strategies available to the decision-maker that are estimated to occur under three different scenarios for factors out of the decision-makers control.  Assume P1 = strategy to market product P1, etc., L1 = Legislative outcome L1, etc. and probabilities of events occurring are as shown.

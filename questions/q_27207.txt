WORKOUT PROBLEM starts here: (Nothing to submit here, just read the problem. Some of the homework format/layout is already provided)   A ball is shot vertically upward with a speed of 35 m/s. The ball will travel upwards reaching some maximum height before falling back to the ground. We will focus only on the travel upward, from launch to the apex. If we split the maximum height in half, we are comparing the amount of time to travel up the first half of the distance with the amount of time to travel the second half of the distance. Given: A ball shot upwards.  Find:  Calculate the maximum height the ball travels from launch to its apex. You MUST follow the multi-step process shown in class and you must use units! Determine the time it takes to go half way up. Again, you MUST follow the multi-step process shown in class and you must use units! Find the time it takes to go the second half of the distance. Must use units!    Assume: Answer the following set of questions.

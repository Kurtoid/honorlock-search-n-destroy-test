A small merry go round at the park is rotating at 0.85 rad/s before a small child jumps on. The child is 35.0 kg and the radius of the merry go round is 1.60 m. If the child lands at a point halfway to the center, what is the angular speed of the system after she lands? Assume the merry go round to be a solid disc with mass of 100 kg and for this problem you may treat the child like a point mass. The moment of inertia of a solid disc is 12MR2{"version":"1.1","math":"12MR2"}.

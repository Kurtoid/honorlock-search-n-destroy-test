What is the first step in the rational decision making model.
The manufacturer of a hot tub is interested in testing two different heating elements for its product. The element that produces the maximum average heat gain after 15 minutes would be preferable. The manufacturer will choose unit A if is superior than unit B.  In a random sample of 85 automobile engine crankshaft bearings, 10 have a surface finish roughness that exceeds the specifications. Do these data present strong evidence that the proportion of crankshaft bearings exhibiting excess surface roughness exceeds 0.10? If the standard deviation of hole diameter exceeds 0.01 millimeters, there is an unacceptable high probability that the rivet will not fit. A sample of 15 diameters has a standard deviation of 0.008 millimeters. Is there strong evidence to indicate that the standard deviation of hole diameter exceeds 0.01 millimeter?

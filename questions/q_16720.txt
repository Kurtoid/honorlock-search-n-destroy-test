You may use HonorLock, the online proctoring service.  HonorLock proctoring service will record a video of you taking the exam.  It will be reviewed by a proctor and then sent to the instructor for review.  The proctor will note any behaviors that may indicate academic dishonesty.  In other words, any behavior that indicates that the student might have had some type of assistance with answering questions on the exam.   The instructor will review the video as well.     There is a zero tolerance policy for academic dishonesty.  Before beginning the exam you must use your webcam to show the entire room where the exam is being taken. This must be a small room with door(s) like a bedroom; it cannot be a room with multiple open doorways such as a living room or library. The room scan video must include a clear and thorough recording of your hands, the desktop, keyboard, under the desk, and the surrounding floors, room, and walls. You must look at the computer screen the entire length of the exam. Do not open other browsers, windows, or documents while you are taking the exam. You may not have or use any type of assistance with the exam. No electronic devices can be present or utilized in the work area. This includes: smartwatches, ear buds, headphones, tablets, MP3 players, tape recorders, phones, TVs, etc. No books, notes, scrap paper, pens, purses, backpacks, clothes, caps, hats, etc. are allowed at your work area. The exam area must remain quiet throughout the exam. No background noise such as radios or televisions are allowed. No other persons or animals can be present at any time in the exam area or within a range that allows communication. You must be seated in full view of the webcam at all times (for every question) during the exam. Moving out of view of the camera is a violation. You may not take a break for any reason during an exam. You may not copy, download or reproduce by any means any questions on any quiz or exam.    I understand that by using HonorLock to proctor my exams for this course, I am agreeing to these terms that are listed as well as the academic dishonesty policy of Santa Fe College found in the student handbook.  I also understand that a violation of any of these terms can result in a grade of "0" zero on the exam.  In addition, the student may be required to take proctored exams at the testing center on the NW campus for the remainder of the course.  Academic dishonesty will be reported.

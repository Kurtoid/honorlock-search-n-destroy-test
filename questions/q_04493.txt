A nine-year maturity AAA-rated corporate bond has a 6 percent coupon rate. The bond's promised yield is currently 5.75 percent and the bond sells for its FPV. The bond pays interest semiannually and has an annual duration of 7.1023 years.   What is the bond's convexity? If promised yields decrease to 5.45 percent, what is the bond's predicted new price, including convexity? Based on your result in b, would you prefer to have a bond with more or less convexity? Explain.

Use the following scenario for the next 4 questions (Questions 11, 12, 13, and 14): A scientist notices that the radioactive element uranium (U) loses its toxicity when incubated in soil for several weeks. He wonders, "How is the soil detoxifying the uranium?" After several days in the university library, he uncovers a report that describes a soil bacterium that can detoxify uranium. He reasons that the native soil bacteria might be responsible for detoxifying the uranium. After splitting a soil sample into six equal portions, he sterilizes 3 portions using high heat and pressure (i.e., kills all bacteria in the sample), and the other 3 he leaves intact (normal live bacteria). Then he adds uranium to all samples and measures the toxicity of the uranium over the next several weeks. To his surprise, uranium from both the sterilized and the intact soil diminish in toxicity.   If the scientist had noticed a difference in the radioactivity of the Uranium between the control and test samples, how might she determine if this difference is a real vs. random difference?

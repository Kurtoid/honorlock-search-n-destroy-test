The home care nurse and Francis discussed heart failure and how she could manage the symptoms more effectively. Francis was very receptive to weighing herself daily, keeping a symptom diary and calling her providers when appropriate, using energy conservation techniques, elevating her legs regularly, and using an extra pillow to elevate her head and shoulders to decrease dyspnea while sleeping. She agreed to schedule the amount and time of her fluid intake based on the nurse's recommendations. She was pleased that the nurse arranged for the delivery of mobile meals that were high in iron, and would receive those meals beginning the next day. Francis and the nurse discussed her medications. The home care nurse described the benefits of using a medication reminder/organizer system; Francis was pleased that the nurse planned to bring a system later that week. Francis agreed to record notes about her medications, their actions, and their side effects in her symptom diary. What intervention in the case study is at the primary prevention level?

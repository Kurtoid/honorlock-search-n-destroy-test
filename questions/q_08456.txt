In the early 1800's, peppered moths living in England rested on tree trunks that were covered with whitish lichens. The moths were also whitish in color and so matched the color of the background on which they rested. This made the moths less visible to the birds that preyed on them. In the late 1840's, an increasing number of very dark moths began to appear in moth populations near cities where pollution had killed most of the lichens, leaving the tree trunks sooty and black. Over the past 100 years, the frequency of dark moths has increased to as much as 98% in populations near polluted cities. What type of selection has operated on moths in the polluted areas since 184?

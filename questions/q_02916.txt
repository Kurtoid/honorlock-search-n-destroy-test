Recall that the set {0,1}* is the set of finite length bit strings. Consider the recursive function flip which takes a bit strings for input and gives a bit strings as output, defined by the following: Foundation rule: flip(l) = l. Constructor rule: For s [?] {0,1}*, flip(s0) = flip(s)1 and flip(s0) = flip(s)1.  (3 points, 1 point each.) Show the output when flip is applied to the following strings. What is:   flip(010)?  flip(1101)?  flip(0010)?   (7 points.) Use structural induction to show that flip(flip(s)) = s for any s [?] {0,1}*.

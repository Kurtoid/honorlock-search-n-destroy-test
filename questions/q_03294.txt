A large mass m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"} is on a horizontal, frictionless surface as shown in the figure. A smaller mass, m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"} is hanging from the pulley. The pulley has mass M{"version":"1.1","math":"M"} and radius R{"version":"1.1","math":"R"} and is in the shape of a solid sphere (moment of inertia 25MR2{"version":"1.1","math":"25MR2"}) and is able to rotate about its center of mass without friction. Let T1{"version":"1.1","math":"T1"} be the tension pulling m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"} and T2{"version":"1.1","math":"T2"} be the tension supporting m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"}. Symbolically set up the THREE equations you would need to find the magnitude of the acceleration of m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"}. There should be an equation based on the motion of m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"}, an equation based on the motion of m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"} and an equation based on the rotation of the pulley. You do not need to actually solve the system of equations, simply set them up. The equations should only contain variables given to you in the problem (m1{"version":"1.1","math":"m1"}, m2{"version":"1.1","math":"m2"}, M{"version":"1.1","math":"M"} and R{"version":"1.1","math":"R"}), three unknowns (two have already been mentioned) and universal constants or numbers. It is possible that some listed variables will cancel out.

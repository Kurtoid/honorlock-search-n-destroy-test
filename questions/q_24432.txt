Refer to the floor plan shown below.  The loading consists of dead load (D) and live load (L). Beams B1 (span = v) are supported by the perimeter walls and girder G1, girder G2, or girder G3.   Beams B2 (span = v) are supported by column C1 or column C2 at one end and perimeter wall at the other end.  These beams support an interior reinforced concrete wall over a distance = y1. Beams B3 (span = v) are supported by girder G3 and perimeter wall.   Beam B4 (span = y2) is supported by girder G4 and perimeter wall. Beams B5 (span = v) are supported by column C1 or column C2 at one end and perimeter wall at the other end end.  Girder G1 (span = 3l) is supported by perimeter wall at one end column C1 at the other end. Girder G2 (span = 3l) is supported by column C1 and column C2.  This girder supports an interior reinforced concrete wall over its entire length. Girder G3 (span = 3l) is supported by perimeter wall at one end column C2 at the other end. Girder G4 (span = 3l) is supported by beams B2.  This girder supports two reinforced concrete interior walls over a distance = x at each end.   Unfactored D = 45 psf, unfactored L = 50 psf, l = 8 ft, v = 16 ft, y1 = 12 ft, y2 = 4 ft, x = 7 ft, each interior wall is 8 in. thick and 9 ft tall. Assume the design floor load is 120 psf, and the load from an interior wall is 810 lb/ft.  The maximum shear in girder G4 is nearly

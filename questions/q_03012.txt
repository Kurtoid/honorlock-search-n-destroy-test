10. A HeNe laser calculated irradiance is 64.97 mW/cm2 and the measured power output is 6.25 mW. Determine the projected diameter of the laser beam.                             11. Determine the irradiance of a HeNe laser (9.47 mW) at the focusing spot created by a DCX lens with a focal length of 220 mm. The divergence angle of the laser is 1.52 mrad.                             12. A Krypton (568 nm) laser with a power of 80.5 mW and a beam radius out of the laser of 4.45 mm is focused for 0.2667 hours by a converging lens with a focal length of 15 cm. Determine: a) the NHZ measured from the lens; b) the minimum optical density for the required laser goggles if the exposure time was 10s.                             13. An Argon laser continuous wave with a power of 650 mW is projected onto a fully dilated human eye pupil of 5.3 mm diameter. The eye is exposed for duration of 10 seconds. Calculate the minimum optical density of a laser safety goggle needed to protect the eye from damage.                           14. A pair of goggles for a CO2 (10.6 um and 6.25 mW) laser have an optical density of 3.4. Determine: a) the laser beam diameter knowing that the exposure time was 10 minutes; b) the optical transmission through the goggles.

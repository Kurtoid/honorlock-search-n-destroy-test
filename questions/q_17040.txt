[FRQ3 PART (A)] On January 1, 2021, Blue Snow, Inc. leases a delivery truck from Branch Motors for 4 years. At the time of the lease, the truck has a value of $40,000 in Branch Motors' accounting books and could have been sold for $45,114 at its fair market value. Four equal lease payments are to be made on January 1 of 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. The truck has a 5-year economic life. At the end of the four-year lease term (that is, on January 1, 2025) the truck is expected to be worth $15,000, but this amount is not guaranteed.

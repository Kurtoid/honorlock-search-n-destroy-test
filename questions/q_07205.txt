There are many reasons why students become interested in applying to the respiratory program at Broward College.  Some students search the internet and find the job availability after graduation.  Some students do a career search to determine what would be the best fit for their personality and academic strengths. Once these students decide on respiratory care, they compare respiratory programs to find the top notch program.  Some students did not get accepted into other health science programs and have decided to try another avenue of getting into the health care profession.  Whatever the reason, once they are in the program, success is usually not predicted by the grades they received in their prerequisite courses.  Some students chose their professors in the pre-requisite courses based on a website rating or hear-say about who gives the easiest grades. However, once in the respiratory program, it becomes apparent if the student has or has not mastered the course content of the prerequisite courses.   According to this passage, students' performance in the prerequisite courses can predict the ability for success while in the respiratory care program.

Consider 3 loci that assort independently: There are two possible alleles at each locus. At each of two of the loci, one allele is completely dominant to the other, and at the third, there is incomplete dominance. Let's name the two possible alleles at the three loci as follows: Locus 1: A and a Locus 2 B and b Locus 3 CRCT In a cross between two individuals with the following genotypes: AaBbCRCT    X   AaBbCRCT there are [blank1] possible offspring phenotypes for the trait controlled by the A locus, there are [blank2] possible phenotypes at the B locus and there are [blank3] possible phenotypes at the C locus. Considering all the traits controlled by these three loci, there are [blank4] different phenotypes possible in the offspring from this cross.

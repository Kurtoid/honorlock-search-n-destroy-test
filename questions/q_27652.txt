Suppose that the manufacturer of bicycle helmets is trying a new type of nylon for their helmets.  In the past the average impact resistance has been 283 grams.  The manufacturer would like to show that the new nylon might have an influence on the impact resistance.  Therefore they ran 36 samples of the new nylon over a relatively short period of time, and the mean and sample standard deviation of the 36 samples was 280 and 6, respectively.  If the company wants to perform a hypothesis test to see if there is a difference in the two nylons..... 1. What is the 95% confidence interval for the mean of the impact resistance of the new nylon?[29] 2. Based on the confidence interval above, what would you conclude about the new nylon?[30] 3. Calculate the test statistic in this hypothesis test (Step 3 in the methodology)?[31] 4. What is the critical value if alpha is 0.05 (Step 4 of the methodology)?[32] 5. What is your conclusion (Step 5 in the methodology)?[33]

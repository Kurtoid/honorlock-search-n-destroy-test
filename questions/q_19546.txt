A breeder is growing pea plants that are either tall (T) or dwarf (t) stature and tall is dominant over dwarf. The peas also have either red (R) flowers or white (r) flowers. He finds that when tall plants with red flowers are crossed with dwarf plants with white flowers that all the offspring are tall and have pink flowers (F1). He then allows the F1 plants to self pollinate and grows out the resultant F2 seeds. Use the Punnett squares below to answer the questions that follow.

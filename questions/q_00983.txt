Lee el siguiente texto y completa las oraciones a continuacion con la opcion apropiada.   La globalizacion abre nuevas oportunidades, tanto comerciales como laborales. Sin embargo, es importante administrar adecuadamente el impacto de la globalizacion sobre el mercado de trabajo. Hace algunos anos, el "eurobarometro" revelaba que cuatro de cada diez ciudadanos de la Union Europea consideraban que el impacto de la globalizacion sobre el empleo seria negativo. Pero un estudio sobre reestructuracion laboral en Europa publicado en el 2017 verifico que estos temores no correspondian a la verdad. Segun el estudio, la perdida de puestos de trabajo como consecuencia de la globalizacion en los veintisiete paises de la Union Europea era menos del ocho por ciento de la perdida total de empleo.   Actualmente, una serie de retos estructurales esta afectando al mundo laboral europeo. Uno de esos retos es el deficit demografico, que implica que hay menos gente en edad de trabajar; otro es el cambio climatico, que obliga a adaptar el modo de trabajo a consideraciones medioambientales. Ademas, los avances tecnologicos y la deslocalizacion (outsourcing) empresarial tambien influyen en el mundo del trabajo. Por ultimo, el desequilibrio entre distintas partes del mundo en cuanto a derechos de los trabajadores y niveles de empleo es una dificultad que hay que superar. Pero estos acontecimientos no pueden atribuirse exclusivamente a la globalizacion, sino a la evolucion de las relaciones de trabajo.

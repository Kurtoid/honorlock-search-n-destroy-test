Read the following case carefully and answer the case study questions at the end.    new balance: attaining a balance in marketing strategy   The U.S. athletic footwear market is likely to grow slowly from 2010 to 2015, according to a recently published report from Mintel International. This is due to the factors such as overly complex manufacturer-retailer relationships that sap brand loyalty and foster excessive bargain hunting, a slow-growth economy, and competition from other shoe manufacturers, as the previously distinct line between athletic and other types of shoes becomes blurred. In addition, weak retail pricing is likely to lead to more of a two-tier market - (1) an upscale shoe market for those most dedicated to athletic shoes (young males) and those with higher levels of discretionary income and (2) a mass market for the rest of the nation. One bright spot revealed by Mintel's consumer research is that respondents overwhelmingly agree that they are willing to "spend money on good sneakers."   Jim Davis, chair of the New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc. is trying to appeal to those consumers identified in Mintel's research. New Balance rose quickly; starting mid-1990's to become the third-largest seller in of athletic shoes. In strategy, New Balance mirrored Nike by launching the largest possible number of shoes styles and selling primarily through specialty athletic shoe stores and sporting goods stores. A big difference, however, was that New Balance created an upscale brand image that aimed to attract a greater number of 35- to 64-year-olds. Times are changing, however, and New Balance is learning that it must also change to keep improving its market growth and profits.   In order to increase the market share of New Balance, Jim Davis is proposing to increase the promotion of the brand by looking at sponsorships and promotions as a way to gain notoriety for its product. Some of the events included the Chicago Marathon, the title sponsorship for the national indoor track and field championships in New York, various walking organizations and the U.S. modern pentathlon team. An alternative strategy is to boost media spending. Most of the increase is allotted for television advertising of men's running and cross-training shoes. New Balance also will run print ads accenting men's and women's running shoes and women's walking shoes, focusing on the Baby-Boomer crowd.   A market research project was put into place in order to choose which strategy will prove to be more effective. Researchers conducted 500 surveys to potential customers (35- to 64-year-old adults) selected using a stratified sampling procedure in Chicago and New York. The purpose of the survey was to describe the overall attitude towards both promotional ideas and to determine which promotion is likely to reach a higher percentage of the target market. Which is New Balance's problem /opportunity?

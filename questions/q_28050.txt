A large furnace flue operating at 440oC was made from low-alloy steel. After 2 years in service, the specimens were removed from the flue and fracture toughness tests were carried out at room temperature.  The average value of Kc was only about 30 MN/m3/2 compared to a value when new of about 80.  The loss in toughness was due to temper embrittlement caused by the impurity phosphorous.  The skin of the flue was made from plate 10 mm thick.  Owing to the self-weight of the flue the plate has to withstand primary membrane stresses up to 60 MN/m2.  Estimate the length of through-thickness crack that will lead to the fracture of the flue when the plan is shut down.

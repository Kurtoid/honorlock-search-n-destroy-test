The HighTech Development Corporation is considering applying for a government research grant that will award $85,000 for the best proposal on how best to use wireless technology to connect rural towns to the Internet.  The cost of preparing a proposal for the grant is $5,000, and the manager feels there is a 50-50 chance of getting the grant.  If the company wins the grant, it must decide whether to use microwave, cellular, or infrared technology.  State-of-the-art equipment for each type of technology that would have to be purchased at the following costs:  microwave = $4,000, cellular = $5,000, and infrared = $4,000.In addition to equipment, the additional staff members would be needed to help carry out the research.  The total cost would depend on how quickly the research would succeed in providing the answers needed to satisfy the government, which is unpredictable.  The manager has estimated best case low cost and worst-case high cost cases and the probabilities for each technology as shown below. If you drew a decision tree for this project, how many decision stages (rectangles) would be required for this situation?

The records for Costco Co. show this data for 2021, its first year of operations - yes, YW!  :) ... * Gross profit on installment sales recorded on the books was $480,000. Gross profit fromcollections of installment receivables was $320,000. * Fines and penalties paid during 2021 were $4,000.  GAAP expensed the amounts while Tax never allows the amounts to be deductible. * Machinery was acquired in January for $300,000. Straight-line depreciation over a ten-yearlife (no salvage value) is used. For tax purposes, MACRS depreciation is used and Costcomay deduct 14% for 2021. * Interest received (included in GAAP) on tax exempt Iowa State bonds was $9,000. * Costco accrued warranty expense of $22,000 during 2021 for GAAP Purposes. Repair costs underwarranties during 2021 were $14,000 which is deductible for Tax. The remainder will be incurred in 2022. * Pretax financial income is $700,000. The tax rate is 20%. (1.) Prepare the appropriate journal entry to record Costco's 2021 income taxes. Show calculations for partial credit.  You may use the Excel Template provided in the first question of the exam to document/prepare your answers.  It is highly recommended that you use Excel formulas and cell references, whenever possible, as the essay requires students to evaluate changes in circumstances.  Be sure to cut and paste your answers/calculations into Canvas for this essay question.  Your Excel file will be attached to this exam in the second question of the exam.  (2.)  Prepare (in "Good Form") and present Costco's 2021 net income as it would be shown on the 2021 Income Statement. Your Income Statement should start at  Pretax Financial Income (a.k.a. Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Expense). (3)   Using the Cumulative Temporary Difference that created a Deferred Tax Asset, name the GAAP account (HINT: Balance Sheet) and its 12/31/21, year-end, balance ($$$) that would hold the cumulative temporary differences. (4)  Assume that during 2022, Costco accrued $25,000 of Warranty Expenses and paid repair costs of $19,000 ($8,000 for 2021 and $11,000 for 2022) related to 2021/2022 warranty contracts.  What is the cumulative temporary difference balance for warranties at the end of 2022? Calculate the "adjustment" required at 12/31/22 to the related DTA/DTL, as appropriate.  Continue to use a 20% tax rate. (5.)  Explain in one or two sentences the impact of the following change in circumstances from your answer in #1 above. Your answer should quantify numerically the impact of this change (e.g. income tax expense (benefit) changed to $XXX), if any, as appropriate and it should provide an updated journal entry to record the 2021 income tax provision.  CHANGE above as follows: Pre-tax accounting income $50,000 and Congress/President enacted into law during 2021 an increase in the federal tax rate to 40% for all tax years starting in 2022 and thereafter.  Modifying the original model used to develop your answer to #1 above is the most efficient way to develop your answer.  Costco, as a tax policy, carries forward any benefits from a Tax Net Operating Loss.  Be sure to copy and paste your answer from #1 above into the Canvas Exam before you modify the Excel spreadsheet.

Optimizing access performance under paging. Consider a paging system that uses page tables, TLB, and memory cache (such as the one shown in the figure). Assuming all pages needed are in main memory and no need to go to the backing store to fetch any pages, formulate the Expected Access Time, EAT, for a virtual address (p,d). Consider main memory access to cost m units of time, TLB access to cost mt units of time, and cache access to cost mc units of time. Further assume the probability that a page is in the TLB is Pt, and the probability that the corresponding frame is in the cache memory to be Pc. Notice that the presence of the frame in the cache is a process not dependent on the presence of the corresponding page in the TLB.

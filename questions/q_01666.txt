A dart is shot out of a spring-loaded toy gun at a 45 degree angle.  The dart experiences air resistance on the way to its peak.  a) What types of energy does the dart have at its peak?  Enter your answer in the space below. b) Draw and fill in an energy bar chart for the dart where:  initial = when the dart is stationary inside the toy gun final =  when the dart is at its peak Use the initial location of the dart as the height where gravitational potential energy is zero.  Be sure to use the relative sizes of the bars, as best you can, to show your understanding of this scenario.  You will scan the energy bar chart and submit it immediately following the quiz.

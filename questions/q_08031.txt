Considering still the elastic solid, you may generate state variables from the energy, temperature, entropy, stress and strain. Recalling that we say something is a natural function of other variables when its infinitesimal is described as a linear combination of infinitesimals of those variables, give (you don't need to name them, just give the algebraic expressions) state variables that are natural variables of i) temperature and strain, ii) temperature and stress and iii) entropy and strain. Make sure to indicate which is which.

On a field trip you discover a skeleton with the following characteristics: the acetabulum is directed laterally, the ischial spine points medially, and the angle inferior to the pubic symphysis is less than 90 degrees. The long bones of the arms and legs are relatively light and show epiphyseal plates. This skeleton is probably from
A biology class with 13 students takes an exam. The exam scores are listed below: 41, 53, 61, 71, 76, 86, 88, 91, 94, 100, 100, 100, 100 (a) (4 points) Give a five-number summary of these scores. (b) (4 points) Draw a histogram of these scores, using class intervals of length 10 (so that your intervals are 20-30, 30-40, and so on). Based on your histogram, is the score distribution left-skewed, right-skewed, neither, or both? (Your answer to this part should just address the skewness question -- you don't have to try to represent the histogram for me.) (c) (4 points) Compute the mean exam score   x -   . (d) (4 points) Is the mean score you computed in part (c) greater or less than the median score? Is this the result you would expect given the skewness you observed in part (b)? (Please put your answer to each part on a separate line, and start that line with (a), (b), (c) or (d) as appropriate, so that I know which answer is supposed to go with each part.)

To get the extra credit for this exam, you will need to solve the problems using only pencil and paper. You can then upload a photo of your paperwork.   Extra Credit (10 points total) Within a population of hamsters, the grey allele (g) is recessive and the white allele (G) is dominant. You collect 100 hamsters and 40 of them are white. Given this information solve the following problems. Show all of your math. I will award most of the points if you set the problem up correctly.   Expected frequencies for both alleles assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The proportion of hamsters in the population that are heterozygous assuming HWE. The frequency of homozygous dominant individuals. What are the relative fitness values for all three genotypes if only 80% of white individuals survive to adulthood while 100% of the gray individuals survive? Given the allele frequencies calculated for "1" above, and the relative fitness values calculated in "4", what will the frequency of both alleles be after one generation of selection?

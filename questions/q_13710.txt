In which way of the following can Moore respond to the problem of the Five-Minute Universe Hypothesis?
You have isolated several strains (Strains YOU200, YOU201, and YOU202) of S. pneumoniae that you think may have mutations in competence genes. You grow the strains, treat them with extra competence peptide to induce competence, and give them DNA you radiolabeled with phosphorus-32 (6000 counts/min). At various times you treat the culture with DNase.  You then precipitate the culture with acid and collect the precipitate on a filter. You take radioactivity readings of the filters and compare your mutants to the wild type strain T4R. Results:        T4R         - 3000 counts/min        YOU200 - 2998 counts/min        YOU201 - 20 counts/min        YOU202 - 6000 counts/min What can you determine about each mutant?

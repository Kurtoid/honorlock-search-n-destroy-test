QUESTION 4 - 9 Points Ace Home Repair, Inc. is in the business of providing residential home repair services in and around Madison, Wisconsin.  Ace Home Repair, Inc. sends its employees into its customers' homes to perform home repairs.  Ace Home Repair was in need of employees to work as home repair specialists and interviewed Burley Peters as a possible new hire.  A Wisconsin statute requires that in order to protect the safety of the general public, all businesses hiring employees that are likely to perform services in residential homes must perform a state criminal background check prior to hiring the employee.  The purpose of this statute is to prevent employers from hiring dangerous criminals for jobs where the employee is likely to have access to customers in their private homes.  At the interview, Ace Home Repair, Inc. asked Burley Peters whether he had any criminal history or any conviction for a violent crime.  Burley Peters assured Ace Home Repair, Inc. that he had no such criminal record.  In fact, Burley Peters had two convictions for aggravated assault and breaking and entering into people's homes.   Burley Peters had broken into two separate homes, assaulted the homeowners, and stolen items from the homes.   Ace Home Repair, Inc. did not perform a criminal background check on Burley Peters so that it could evaluate whether or not he posed a danger to Madison Home's customers.  Had Ace Home Repair, Inc. requested a state criminal background check it would have discovered the two prior convictions and it would not have hired Burley Peters.   Ace Home Repair, Inc. hired Burley as a home repair person to perform home repairs in its customers' homes. On his second week on the job, Burley was assigned to perform cleaning services at the home of Robert Rose.   Robert had hired Ace Home Repair to fix up his house.   While inside Robert's house, Burley attacked Robert and stole Robert's wallet.  Robert was seriously injured as a result of Burley's attack.   Robert has sued Ace Home Repair claiming that it was negligent in the manner in which it conducted the interview process and in hiring Burley.    REQUIRED - 9 Points:  Will Robert prevail in his negligence lawsuit against Ace Home Repair?  In separately lettered or numbered paragraphs, discuss the elements of Robert's negligence action against Ace Home Repair, Inc.  DO NOT discuss any claims that Robert may have against Burley and DO NOT discuss in response to this question whether Robert may assert the doctrine of negligence per se against Ace Home Repair.

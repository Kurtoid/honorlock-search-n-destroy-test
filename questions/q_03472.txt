Unfortunately, since the underlying databases are so enormous, running one of these reports can take hours!  Managers are getting really frustrated. You have decided to implement a new system that will make them very happy.  Every night, it goes through the enormous databases, calculating summary data that is much smaller.  The "top 30" reports will all run against the new, smaller summary data.  Thanks to the pre-processing, they'll run almost 1000 times faster than before.  Managers will get answers almost instantly.

The technology that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use is a novel one for vaccines: they use mRNA. Sounds familiar? One of the drawbacks of the Pfizer vaccine (not so much of the Moderna one because of the compounds they use) is that it has to be kept at ultra-freezing temperatures (-80degC). Why is that? Hint: yep, we learned about this, and explains why DNA is our genetic material and not RNA.

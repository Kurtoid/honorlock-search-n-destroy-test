4.   Read the case study below and answer the questions that follow:               We all get tired sometimes, especially if we have been doing a lot of physical activity. But for Jasmin, a 34-year-old former high school track star who is now a recreational runner, her tiredness was going far beyond what she thought should be normal for someone in generally good physical shape. She was experiencing extreme fatigue after her runs, as well as muscle cramping, spasms, and an unusual sense of heaviness in her legs. At first, she just chalked it up to getting older, but her exhaustion and pain worsened to the point where the former athlete could no longer run for more than a few minutes at a time. She began to experience other unusual symptoms, such as blurry vision and vomiting for no apparent reason. Concerned, Jasmin went to her doctor, who ran many tests and consulted with several specialists. After several months, she was finally diagnosed with a mitochondrial disease.  Her doctor explained that this is a disorder that occurs when the structures that produce energy for a cell malfunction. A common factor among mitochondrial diseases is that the mitochondria are unable to completely burn food and oxygen to generate energy, which is essential for normal cell function. Symptoms might include poor growth, developmental delays, and muscle weakness. There's no cure, but physiotherapy and medication can manage symptoms.   https://flexbooks.ck12.org/cbook/ck-12-college-human-biology-flexbook-2.0/section/4.1/primary/lesson/case-study%253a-the-importance-of-cells

2.2   Read the following article and answer the questions that follow:  New bean varieties bred to beat heat   March 26 2015 at 12:11pm     Scientists have bred 30 new varieties of "heat-beating" beans designed to provide protein for the world's poor in the face of global warming.   Described as "meat of the poor", beans are a key food source for more than 400 million people across the developing world, but the area suitable for growing them could drop 50 percent by 2050 because of global warming, endangering tens of millions of lives, scientists said.  Some of the 30 new types also have higher iron content to help increase their nutritional value, CGIAR, the research group backing the new discoveries, said in a statement.  New heat tolerant beans might be able to handle average global temperature increases of 4 degrees.   Bean growers in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa - including Nicaragua, Haiti, Brazil, Honduras, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo - are likely to be the worst hit by global warming, researchers said.  Some of these countries, dependent on small farmers to feed themselves, are not in good positions to adapt to a warming planet.  Clayton Campanhola, director of plant production and protection at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, said the discovery of new "climate smart" bean strains is a big deal.  iol.co.za

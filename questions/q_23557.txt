In this practice essay, you will gain experience for formatting the REAL Midterm exam, which will open tomorrow (Tuesday, March 30, at 8 AM). PROMPT: Contrast your two favorite restaurants in the Upstate. Focus on their differences, rather than their similarities, and discuss the merits of each.  MAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING: * Although you are writing about your preferences, write in the ACADEMIC THIRD PERSON voice. Therefore, do not use the pronouns I/me/my. * Instead of "My favorite restaurant is Subway", you might write, instead, "One restaurant enjoyed by many diners in the Upstate is Subway." This is important to practice for both the midterm and final exams. Please see me if you need clarification on this issue. * DO NOT use second person pronouns in this essay, such as you/your. This is the "generic you" and should be avoided in all formal writing.   * This essay must have, at minimum, 4 body paragraphs. However, you are not limited to the four paragraph structure if you prefer to write more.  * Ensure you have an introduction with a hook and thesis; body paragraphs with supporting details and transitions; and a conclusion wherein the thesis is restated.  * Use the Word Count function, and ensure that you have written a minimum of 500 words before you submit your work.  * I will "grade" these essays tonight, as in, I will add my specific comments in the event that I see something you need to address before the real final. Good Luck!

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines developed to fight Covid_19 are a new generation of vaccines. Unlike traditional vaccines which generally involve injecting the body with weakened or inactive pathogen to elicit an immune response, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are RNA vaccines. In this case, messenger RNA (mRNA) that codes for the Covid_19 antigen is injected into the body. The mRNA is taken up into cells and translated into the antigen protein. Consider a situation where a B-cell has translated the mRNA and now has antigen protein present.  A. Explain the process to produce antibodies against Covid_19.   B. Later, if a vaccinated person is infected with the coronavirus, how would antibodies help prevent the virus from entering host cells?  Be specific with the antibody action.

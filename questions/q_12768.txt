Choose to complete either this Calvin cycle question OR the previous Z-scheme question: Complete the flow chart of the Calvin cycle.  For your answers, write the numbers 1 through 13 in order, typing in what each numbered space represents (e.g.  1=?), then hitting return to give the next number in order and what it represents.   ALSO indicate the number of "turns" of the cycle required to produce the product that is the "goal" of the Calvin cycle.

Molecular Orbital TheoryThe following molecular orbital diagram may be used for the following problems. For oxygen and fluorine, the s2p orbital should be lower in energy than the p2p. However, the diagram will still yield correct bond order and magnetic behavior for these molecules.Refer to Molecular Orbital Theory. Assuming that the molecular orbital energy diagram for a homonuclear diatomic molecule applies to a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, determine which of the following species has the highest bond order.

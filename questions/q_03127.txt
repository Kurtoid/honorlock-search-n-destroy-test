(10 pts.) A curling stone slides on ice with a speed of 1.70 m/s and collides elastically with an identical, stationary curling stone. After the collision, the first stone has a velocity of 0.800 m/s in a direction that makes a counterclockwise angle of 61.9deg with its original direction of travel. At what speed and what direction is the second stone traveling after the collision? NOTE: You must show a complete appliciation of the relavent conservation laws in order to get credit for this problem.

Upon graduation from FSU, you were offered a job as a law clerk for a firm in Tampa.  You were an especially appealing candidate to the firm because of your extensive knowledge in sport law.  Because of the job's proximity to the beach and the potential to see the Tampa Bay Bucs win another Super Bowl (Thank you, Tom Brady), among other things, you gladly accepted this position. At your first day on the job, the firm's head council, Kylee O'Daniel (who prefers to be called K.O.D.) approached you about working on a memo in regards to a new client.  K.O.D. provided you with the following information on the client: The client, Brad, "The Bomber," Smith is an English born amateur baseball player.  Brad The Bomber rightfully received his nickname for his keen ability to hit bombs off of nearly any pitch that comes his direction.  The 20-year-old is looking to sign with a Major League Baseball (MLB) team as soon as possible.    Scouts have likened The Bomber to the talents of Mike Trout and think he can be a major asset to any team in the league.  Because of his keen eye for deciphering pitches and his athletic talent, The Bomber is arguably ready for the big leagues.  The Bomber is expected to be a highly sought-after talent in the free-agency market.  Unfortunately for The Bomber as an international player under the age of 25, he is subjected to MLB's collectively bargained international free agency rules.      After doing some extensive research (for which you silently thanked Dr. O.D. for making you do all that research on Nexis Uni for that legal research paper), you discovered the following components of those international free agency rules. MLB's international free agency rules impose yearly cap per team for bonuses paid to international free agents, which is generally around $3 million per team to be divided among all of the team's international signees.  The rules also limit per-year compensation for international free agents to no more than the minimum MLB salary of $545,000 at the major league level until the player has received enough service time to qualify for salary arbitration.  As an unsigned player, The Bomber is not a member of the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) and is thus unable to receive any legal help from their office. If these rules indeed apply to The Bomber, he will receive significantly less pay than expected.  Furthermore, The Bomber thinks his talents warrant the pay of more seasoned veterans.  The Bomber deems this rule to be restrictive of his ability to market his talents and make money off of those talents.  After doing his own internet research (unlucky for The Bomber, he did not have Dr. O.D.'s class), The Bomber has determined he thinks his best legal recourse against MLB falls under antitrust law.  This is where you come in!  With all of this in mind, prepare a memorandum to inform K.O.D. of the options for this potential client.  Consider the following questions when creating your memo:
Suppose Clampett, Inc. terminated its S election on August 28, 2015. At the end of the S corporation's short tax year ending on August 28, 2015, J.D.'s stock basis and at-risk amounts were both zero (he has never had debt basis), and he has a suspended loss of $20,000. In 2016, J.D. made additional capital contributions of $5,000 on March 15th and $12,000 on September 5th. How much loss may J.D. deduct in 2016?

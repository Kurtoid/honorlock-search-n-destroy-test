Multiaxial System Labeling (10 points) - Write your answers directly on this examination form.  Please read the following case description of Libby.  Label Libby's correct diagnosis in the space below (just simply label the disorder - no need to list any symptoms). Then, explain how Dr. Fixit might conceptualize the causes of Libby's disorder from both the BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL and the DIATHESIS-STRESS MODEL (again, using specific information provided in the case - do not speculate!). Be sure to use specific examples from the case to support each part of the model. Please note that there is more information included in this case than you will use for your answers. There is more than 1 correct way to provide examples for each model; however, please do not use the same information for both models.   --- Libby is a 23-year old female who began seeing Dr. Fixit last month for psychotherapy following the end of a 2-year romantic relationship.  Libby reported feeling excessively sad and had no appetite, no motivation, and had lost pleasure in activities she used to enjoy.  She has had these symptoms for the past 2 months, since her relationship ended. Libby also reported having thoughts of suicide.  Libby stated that she had felt like this a few times in her life before, but this was the worst.  Libby also mentioned that she had experienced two instances in her life in which she felt energetic, had little need for sleep, and experienced inflated self-esteem.  During one of these times, Libby got in trouble for stealing a car because she wanted to take a joy ride in the middle of the night.  During the other time, she believed she could fly and was preparing to jump off a cliff. These symptoms lasted for 1-2 weeks each time.   Dr. Fixit asked Libby to tell him about her family background. She stated that her mother has a mood disorder diagnosis (though Libby wasn't quite sure which one). She also mentioned that she was physically abused as a very young child by one of her neighbors. Libby reported that she thinks she otherwise had a pretty typical childhood and has a good relationship with her parents, though her mother's mood disorder at times affected her home life and her mother's ability to effectively parent. Libby enrolled in college after she finished high school, but dropped out after the first semester. At that time, she had no job and no place to live, since she could not continue living in the dorms and her parents wouldn't let her move back in. It was around this time that Libby experienced her first symptoms of a mood disorder. Dr. Fixit recommended that Libby receive psychotherapy, and provided her with a referral for psychiatric medication, as he suspects that Libby has some neurotransmitter deficits/abnormalities.

Question 8: Epigenetic Gene Regulation as a Drug Target (Dr. D. Liao)    Azacitibine and decitabine are two cytidine analogs that inhibit DNMTs. Describe briefly how these drugs may inhibit cancer cell growth. (5 points)    The chemical structures of the two compounds are provided below.          2. Zinc is required for the deacetylation reaction catalyzed by some histone deacetylases (HDACs). The structures of the HDAC inhibitor SAHA (panel A in the figure shown below) and CMP1 (panel B) in complex with an HDAC enzyme have been determined. The catalytic zinc ion in the catalytic center is shown as a sphere in cyan. Based on the structure of HDAC-inhibitor complexes, describe briefly the mechanism of drug action of HDAC inhibitors.

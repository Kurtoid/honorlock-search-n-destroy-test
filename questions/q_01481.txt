A recent poll found that 70% of adult Americans believe that the overall state of moral values in the United States is poor. Suppose a random sample of 140 adult Americans is conducted in which they are asked if they believe the overall state of moral values is poor or not.  Give the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution. Leave answers exact and use correct notation. Use the normal approximation to the binomial to approximate the probability that exactly 90 of those surveyed feel the state of morals is poor. Provide a shaded sketch that is labeled appropriately as part of your answer. Use the normal approximation to the binomial to approximate the probability that more than 100 of those surveyed feel the state of morals is poor. Provide a shaded sketch that is labeled appropriately as part of your answer. Use the normal approximation to the binomial to approximate the probability that at most 95 of those surveyed feel the state of morals is poor. Provide a shaded sketch that is labeled appropriately as part of your answer.    You do not need to type anything for this question.

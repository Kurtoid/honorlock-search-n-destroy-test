Who proposed the theory of continental drift?
2.   Which of the following is characteristic of enzymes?
Q#3. Darwinism is the name given to the idea that evolution is the result of the action of natural selection producing change in successive populations.  ________is a more evolved version of evolutionary explanation which includes an understanding of the role of genetics in producing and redistributing the enormous amounts of variation found in natural populations.  Q#4. Gregor Mendel proposed a model of inheritance based on his observations of seven traits of simple inheritance in the garden pea plant (each of these seven traits was controlled by one gene locus).  Population geneticists like Dobzhansky showed that Mendel's model of discrete inheritance also applied to traits of complex inheritance such as skin color in which multiple ________ control the expression of the trait.  Q#5 In 1902, Walter Sutton proposed that Mendel's hereditary factors ("genes") ride on the _________he saw in the nucleus of each cell when he examined dividing cells with a light microscope.  He pointed out that Mendel's Laws of Segregation and Independent Assortment were consistent with the movement of _________ during meiosis.  [Note:  The same term is used in both blanks] Q#6 Geneticists study inheritance at the level of population, organism, cell and ________.  When there is good "fit" between knowledge generated at each level of analysis, scientists have increased confidence that they are describing a single reality and have a correct understanding of the relationship of genes, proteins and traits. Q#7 A gene is a section of a DNA molecule that codes for a protein.  To begin protein synthesis, a portion of the DNA molecule unzips and one strand is used to create a mirror-image molecule of mRNA.  This mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the cytoplasm.  mRNA codons (three base sequences) are read by a ribosome and used to bring specific amino acids into position (forming the primary structure of a protein).  The chart showing which mRNA codon specifies which amino acid is called the _________. Q#8 The Human _________Project has completed its goal of sequencing all three billion base pairs found in the DNA of 46 human chromosomes.  Scientists are still sorting out which segments code for proteins (i.e. which are genes), how these proteins function in humans, and how other parts of the genome affect the expression of genes.  The ________ of chimpanzees (our closest living relative) was sequenced in 2005 and is being compared to that of humans.  [Note:  The same term is used for both blanks] Q#9 ________ developed a highly successful system for classifying living organisms that placed every species within a nested series of hierarchically arranged categories.  Although he did not understand the reason why this pattern existed in nature, biologists would later explain this as evidence that all contemporary organisms are descended from a common ancestor.  Q#10 Mammals are the only vertebrates to have a complex system of reproduction which includes internal gestation, lactation and extended parental care. Generally, mammals are the only vertebrates that ________ their food. Early mammals of 200 million years ago (and most living mammals) have four different kinds of teeth (incisors, canines, premolars, molars) for food processing. Q#11 All primates have eyes facing in the forward plane with some degree of bony eye protection.  Supported by visual information sent by each eye to each hemisphere of the brain, this provides the basis for _______ vision which allows primates to be good at judging distance. Q#12 All primates have prehensile hands with long fingers, an opposable thumb and _________.  All primates have touch receptors in their fingertips for getting information about the world. Q#13 All primates use _______for feeding.  Some primates (e.g. chimpanzees) use ______ for tool use.  [Note:  The same term is used in both blanks]

Sony was a pioneer in the portable music market segment. Sony's Walkman was an innovative product which created a new category altogether and made Sony a technological leader. This gave the company an edge over other consumer electronics brands that introduced portable music players for a very long time. In this example, Sony had the:

In lab #6 (Fitts' Law: Reciprocal Tapping Task) we used a simple reciprocal tapping task to help show Fitts' Law.  The results, in theory, helped illustrate the speed-accuracy trade-off in reciprocal tapping, especially with respect to the roles played by movement distance (amplitude) and target size (width). Now, design your own experiment that would illustrate the speed-accuracy trade-off.  You must be able to collect data in this experiment and explain what (in theory) should the results indicate.  Don't forget to indicate what variable(s) should stay the same.

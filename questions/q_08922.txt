GELO #6 - Question 6 Carl is conducting an experiment to determine if increased ultraviolet radiation from the decrease in the ozone layer is killing off frog tadpoles. After examining all of the data available in the library, Carl decides to go with a hypothesis that increased ultraviolet radiation from the sun is killing off the tadpoles.    Carl puts tadpoles into two groups. Group 1 involves 100 tadpoles in a five gallon container of water, which is covered by glass (knowing that the glass will filter out the ultraviolet radiation). Group 2 will be set up exactly like Group 1, except instead of being covered with glass, it is covered with an acrylic plexiglass, which will not filter out the ultraviolet radiation. Carl then places the groups outside for a period of one month, and observes the results.       Which group is the control group (Group 1 or Group 2)?

Please use the information below to answer questions 3-5. When there are not sufficient comparable sales for the appraisers to estimate the value of a vacant land parcel, normally the appraisers would apply the fundamental land residual analysis to determine the highest and best use of the vacant land parcel and its highest land value. Suppose the screening process produces three potential uses for a vacant site. For each of those potential uses, the development costs, expected annual income generated from the property under each use, the expected rate of return (discount rate) are shown in the table below.      Potential Uses     Office  Retail  Hotel    Annual Income  $                    300,000  $                   250,000  $                   600,000   Expected Rate of Return  9% 10% 15%   Development Cost (Value of the Improvements)  $                2,000,000  $                1,400,000  $                2,500,000   Value of the Property (Land & Improvements)         Land Residual Value            3.

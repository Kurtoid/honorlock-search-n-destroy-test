In Vivek Pai's paper on the Flash webserver, the authors evaluated several webserver designs using two traces - the Owlnet trace, whose dataset size was 100MB, and the CS trace, whose dataset size was 7.8GB. The webservers they compared include Flash (which followed the AMPED model), SPED (the Zeus single-process event-driven server), MT (a multi-threaded webserver), MP (a multi-process webserver, Apache (an unoptimized Apache webserver).  The tests were performed using a 333MHz PentiumII CPU with 128 MB of memory and multiple 100 Mbit/s Ethernet interfaces.  Give the correct answer to the following questions:1. In the event of the CS trace, which of the following will perform better:     a.    Flash vs. MT [a]     b.    Flash vs. MP [b]     c.    Flash vs. SPED [c]     d.    SPED vs. MT [d]     e.    MT vs. MP [e]2. In the event of the Owlnet trace, which of the following will perform better:     f.     Flash vs. MT [f]     g.    Flash vs. MP [g]     h.    SPED vs. MT [h]     i.     MT vs. MP [i]     j.     MP vs. Apache [j]3. Without modifying the implementation described in the paper, when running on a more recent quad-core platform with 12GB of memory, which one would you expect to perform better:     k.    Flash vs. MT [k]     l.   MT vs. MP [l]

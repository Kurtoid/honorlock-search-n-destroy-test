Humanism is an outlook or system of thought attaching prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters. Humanist beliefs stress the potential value and goodness of human beings, emphasize common human needs, and seek solely rational ways of solving human problems. As humans, we have the choice of right and wrong, and, ultimately, we know when we do something right or when we do something wrong. Thus, how is the development of prejudice in each poem the opposite of humanism and the ideas in which our nation was founded? Make a claim and develop in a 2-3 paragraph response. Use evidence from each poem to support your claim and cite in MLA format.

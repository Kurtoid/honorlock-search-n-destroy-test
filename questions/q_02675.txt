Student:   I have read the syllabus, course overview & solutions to problems and understand all the information contained within. I also understand that I am responsible for all assignments and quizzes and the deadlines imposed and that there will be no extensions on assignments open for a week or more. I also understand the absence policy, log-in policy and deadline policy and recognize that if I violate any or all of these policies I can/may/will be withdrawn from the course immediately. It is my responsibility to obtain help if I have a problem with Canvas and/or my computer and that this does not preclude me from my assignments. I know that grades/points are earned and not "averaged" up in this course; my grade accurately reflects the points I earned. I am aware that my final is comprised of the cf notes that I view each week as well as slide id and questions from previous quizzes. I have/will view/ed the course calendar and I am also aware that, per the MSVCC policy, that assignments may be due during Holidays/Breaks and must be completed as usual per the course. I understand this course is approximately 3 weeks long, and I will adhere to the calendar. I realize that even though all assignments may be opened after the completion of the Opening Assignments that the due dates and deadlines will still be enforced.

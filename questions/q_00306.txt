A vendor sells hot dogs, bags of potato chips, and soft drinks. A customer buys 5 hot dogs, 4 bags of potato chips, and 4 soft drinks for $23.50. The price of a hot dog is $1.25 more than the price of a bag of potato chips. The cost of a soft drink is $3.50 less than the price of two hot dogs. (a) Write a system of equations that models this application, where x is the price of a hot dog, y is the price of a bag of potato chips, and z is the price of a soft drink.

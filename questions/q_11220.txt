Scores on the verbal portion of the GRE follow a normal distribution with a mean of 550 and standard deviation of 120.   Suppose you repeatedly randomly sample test-takers with samples of size n = 100. Use the sampling distribution of these samples to determine the probability that the average (mean) score in a single sample will be between 490 and 610.   First, record the z-scores associated with the mean scores of 490 and 610 when n = 100. The z-score for the mean of 490 is [lowzscore] and the z-score for the mean of 515 is [highzscore]. Be sure to use at least two decimal places in the z-scores, like 0.12 and not 0.1.   Second, determine the probability that the mean score in this sample is between 485 and 515 when n = 100. The probability that the mean score in this sample is between 485 and 515 is [probability]. Enter the value for the probability to four decimal places, like 0.1234 and not 0.12     Note: I will be checking this answer by hand to verify Canvas' grading decision.

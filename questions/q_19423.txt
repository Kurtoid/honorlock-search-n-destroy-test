QUESTION 6     A light ray moves from ruby into water. The refractive index of water is 1,33 and the refractive of ruby is 1,76. The angle between the incident ray and the surface of water is 70deg.     Right click on the button below to open the image in a new tab.      6.1   Define the term optical density.   (2)     6.2   Calculate the angle of refraction ([?]r) in water.   (4)     6.3   Is the angle of refraction ([?]r) LARGER THAN or SMALLER THAN the angle of incidence ([?]i)? Explain your answer.   (2)     6.4   State the two conditions for total internal reflection.   (2)     6.5   Calculate the critical angel between the interface of ruby and water.   (4)             [14]
An action potential in the [A] opens voltage gated channels that causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release [B], which binds to [C].  This binding causes [D] to move, exposing the binding sites on the [E].  At this point, the moveable heads on [F] can bind to these exposed filaments. Repeated cycles of cross-bridge binding, pivoting, and detachment occur, (much like rowing a boat with an oar) powered by the breakdown of [G] to ADP and P. These actions cause the [H] to shorten. When the muscle action potential stops, the binding sites are covered, and return to muscle length takes place by the pulling force of another muscle group or gravity.

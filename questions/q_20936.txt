A fast-food chain is trying to determine whether it should switch from having 4 cash registers with 4 separate lines, or 4 cash registers with a single line. It has been determined that the mean wait time in both lines is equal, however, the chain is uncertain about which line has less variability in wait time.  From experience, the chain knows that wait times in 4 separate lines are normally distributed with a mean of 2.3 minutes and a standard deviation of 1.2 minutes.  In a study, the chain reconfigured 5 restaurants to have a single line with 4 registers and measured the wait times for 50 randomly selected customers.  The average wait time for these 50 randomly selected customers was 2.2 minutes with a standard deviation of 0.84 minutes.  Is the variability in wait time less for the single line, than for multiple lines at the 0.05 significance level.   Interpret the above conclusion.

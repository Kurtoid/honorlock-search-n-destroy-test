Write a function named is_palindrome that accepts a string parameter and returns true if that string is a palindrome, or false if it is not a palindrome. For this problem, a palindrome is defined as a string that contains exactly the same sequence of characters forwards as backwards, case-insensitively. Spaces, punctuation, and any other characters should be treated the same as letters; so a multi-word string or string with numbers or punctuation would count as a palindrome too. Below are some sample calls    Function Call Value Returned   is_palindrome("madam") true   is_palindrome("RacCAr") true   is_palindrome("dog god") true   is_palindrome("123 $$ 321") true   is_palindrome("madham") false   is_palindrome("antena") false   is_palindrome("Taco cat") false   is_palindrome(TACOcat) true
A company acquires a natural resource for $1,200,000 and spends another $520,000 on development of the site and $370,000 for a nonmovable tangible asset installed at the site and $150,000 for tangible movable equipment. Both assets have an expected useful life of 10 years. The natural resource is expected to yield 200,000 units over its expected life. In year 1, 10,000 units are extracted from the resource. What is the depletion expense for year 1? (Round any intermediary calculations to the nearest cent, and round your final answer to the nearest dollar.)

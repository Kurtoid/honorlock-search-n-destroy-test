Die kerswas aan die binnekant rondom die pit van die kers smelt. Terselfdertyd vul die reuk van potpourridampe, afkomstig van aromatiese kristalle in die kers, die lug.

(5)     5.2.2   Watter energieverandering het die molekules ondergaan tydens die proses?   (2)     5.3   Terwyl die kers brand, verdamp die gegeurde kristalle en versprei die geur daarvan vinning deur die lug. Wat word die proses genoem wanneer:      5.3.1   die kristalle oorgaan in die gasfase?   (1)     5.3.2   die reuk van die gas deur die lug versprei?   (1)     5.4   Is die verandering genoem in Vraag 5.3.1 hierbo, 'n fisiese- of chemiese verandering?   (1)     5.5   Na 'n rukkie word die kers doodgeblaas en die gesmelte kerswas stol weer. Word energie opgeneem, of afgegee tydens die stollingsproses?   (1)          [16]
Marathon runners often practice "carb loading" (eating lots of carbohydrates like pasta) prior to a race.  The purpose of this practice is to increase the stores of energy available for muscles to use.  Film yourself explaining how energy is used by muscle fibers and how this practice of "carb loading" benefits the runner's muscles.  Be sure to use the terms glucose, glyclogen, creatine phosphate, and ATP in your explanation.

The nurse should administer how may milliliters for each dose? (Round to the whole number) _____________ mL/dose

Like Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon was a soldier during WWI and wrote poetry about his experiences.  Read the short poem below and then explain the poem's theme or message.   Grandeur of Ghosts by Siegfried Sassoon   When I have heard small talk about great men I climb to bed; light my two candles; then Consider what was said; and put aside What Such-a-one remarked and Someone-else replied.

How can they use such names and be not humble? I have sat silent; angry at what they uttered. The dead bequeathed them life; the dead have said What these can only memorize and mumble.

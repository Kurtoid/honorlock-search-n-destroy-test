Gilbert's Gap Bakery, located in Hollywood Hollow Kentucky, was a regionally famous bakery of cookies and cupcakes, which were packaged and sold in retail establishments throughout Kentucky, Southern Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana. Gilbert's Gap Bakery had just baked and packaged a large batch of their number one bestselling cookies, the caramel creme filled, coconut and cashew topped Gilbert's Sweet Sliders. They were very good. They were packaged in foil-covered boxes, but somehow some of them had become infested with insects. It turned out that already 20 boxes had been sold in the retail store connected to the bakery, but none had been shipped yet. A few customers had brought them back, complaining of the insects, but not all did. The president of Gilberts Gap Bakery, Gilbert Golander, said that they could not inspect the packages, and keep only the ones that were not infested, because there were too many packages - about $20,000 worth - "and because they would have to tear the foil to open each box. That would mean the packages would appear as if they had been opened. He wants to sell them at a discount to Dalia's Diminished Dollar Store, a small retail discount chain that sells primarily to poor people in rural Appalachia. He believes that those poor people will like whatever good cookies they can get, and won't mind a few insects here and there. After all, probably most of the packages do not have insects, he says, though nobody knows for sure how many do. Giselle Gabriela Golander, the manager of logistics, said they should give them all to the local charity to give to the poor people, since she said "poor people won't be particular about a few bugs here and there. Poor people like cookies, especially homeless people. " He said it would be good for the community. What should the bakery do?

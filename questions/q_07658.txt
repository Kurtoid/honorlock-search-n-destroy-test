These are position vs. time graphs for strings plucked on the harp at different points in a song, produced by a motion detector. Some graphs were produced by sampling the position of the same string over time. Others were produced by sampling the position of different strings over time.   Which graph represents vibrations that are producing a sound whose pitch is not thelowest and is not the highest of the three?

From the balanced equation, Zn + S - ZnS, a chemist calculates that 6.41 g of zinc sulfide should be obtained. However, the chemist isolates only 5.01 g of product. What is her percent yield for this reaction?
Sawing a woman in half is an easy illusion for magicians.  The trick begins when a table holding a coffin-like box is rolled onstage.  A female assistant is hiding inside that table.  When the magician displays the box to the audience, it is, of course empty.  Then the magician asks a female assistant on stage to climb into the box.  As she does this, the hidden woman enters the box through a trapdoor in the table, stickers her feet out one end, and curls up with her head between her knees.  The other woman, draws her knees up to her chin, puts her head out the other end of the box.  Now the box appears to be holding one woman, and the magician can saw right through.  After he does so, the woman at the foot end slides back into the table as the magician reopens the box. _________27.  The main pattern of organization of the selection is

Report your answer to each question or problem below. Make sure you reference your answers by numbering them according to the question or problem. Information that may be useful: molar mass of CaCO3 = 100.1 g/mol molar mass of CO2 = 44.0 g/mol R = 0.0821 L atm K-1 mol-1   1. Reactant A gives products B  and C according to the chemical equation below. Reactant A has a molar mass of 323.54 g/mol. Product B has a molar mass of 425.78 g/mol. If 5.00 g of A yields 9.65 g of B, what is the percent yield of B for the reaction? Show all calculations. (3 pts)  2 A ---> 3 B  + C   2. What is the molar mass of product C in Question 1? You do not need to show calculations. (1 pt) 3. CaCO3 (s) reacts with HCl (aq) to produce H2O (l), CaCl2 (aq), and CO2 (g). Write a balanced total ionic equation for this reaction. This equation must be perfectly correct and formatted to receive any credit. (3 pts) 4. 3.21 g of CaCO3 reacts with excess HCl and the resulting gas from the reaction is collected into a container having a volume of 524 mL. What is the percent yield of the reaction if the pressure in the container is 1.05 atm at 25.0 0C after completion of the reaction? Assume the starting pressure in the container is negligible. Show all calculations. (3 pts)

BANKRECONCILIATION AND INTERNAL CONTROL         1.3   On 10 May 2010 Jaco came to the office to collect his cheque for the period that he has done work for Henk. The following conversation was between them             Henk   I cannot belief that you have left the reconciliation unbalanced and expected that I have to complete your work for you.              Jaco   What! Don't tell me that you have wasted your time trying to balance the bank reconciliation statement?  Your work is already demanding why must more effort be done              Henk   Do you want to tell me that it is right to leave the bank reconciliation unbalanced?              Jaco   Oh, I would only have changed a few figures to let it balance and then the owners will be happy. I think it is a waste of time!             Henk   With that attitude of yours I would not be surprise if you are experiencing cash flow problems.             1.3.1   With reference to this conversation explain to Jaco why is it important to do a bank reconciliation monthly.Name at least THREE reasons.   (6)                           While he had this conversation with Jaco, Henk realised that the bank charges are all of a sudden much higher during April. On closer examination he found that there has been a similar trend over the last three months. He has received a letter from the bank, four months ago, to inform him that as a result of legislation the bank charges were decreased. Henk has contacted the bank manager and learned that he is not the only client that has complained about it. They have accessed that one of their workers have added each month small amounts to the bank charges, which he has then put in his pocket. Up to date the bank assessed that this person has taken more than R100 000. He used it to pay for his sons' medical cost who was in a motor accident. Jaco says it is acceptable because it is only small amounts out of each person's bank account and the person(employee) is definitely in need - we have to look at it as part of our service to the community.             1.3.2   Do you agree with Jaco's opinion? Give TWO reasons.   (5)         1.3.3   If you were the bank manager in this case, how would you handle this situation?  State TWO steps that you would have taken.   (4)                 [53]

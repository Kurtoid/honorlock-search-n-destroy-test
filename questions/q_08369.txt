A plaintiff files a diversity action in federal court against a defendant for the tort of negligence under East Carolina law, seeking actual and punitive damages. In East Carolina, as in many states, a plaintiff is eligible for punitive damages in tort if there is a factual finding that the defendant acted with at least reckless mens rea (i.e., more than mere negligence). In federal court, as in most states, the factual question of whether a defendant acted recklessly is normally allocated to the jury. However, an East Carolina statute provides that in East Carolina state courts, the fact of recklessness must be found by the trial judge. The defendant argues that the federal district court must follow East Carolina law by giving the decision to find recklessness to the judge. It cites evidence showing that judges are statistically less likely than juries to award punitive damages in tort cases. However, the plaintiff wishes to argue that the federal court should instead assign the question to the jury, despite state law.Which of the following is the strongest argument the plaintiff could make here to persuade the federal court to follow the federal practice of assigning this question to the jury?

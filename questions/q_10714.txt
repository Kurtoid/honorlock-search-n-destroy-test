Below are oxygen binding curves for myoglobin and hemoglobin.   Blank #1: Which of the curves shows cooperative binding of O2, myoglobin or hemoglobin? Blank #2: Which has a lower P50 value, myoglobin or hemoglobin? Blank #3: What is the approximate P50 value for myoglobin, with units? Blank #4: At high O2 pressures, both myoglobin and hemoglobin have comparable O2 affinities. In the tissues, however, where the oxygen pressure is much lower, hemoglobin has a much _______ (higher/lower) affinity for O2 than myoglobin, allowing it to ______(release/absorb) O2 ______(to/from) myoglobin.  Consider the inhibitors CO and CO2. Blank #5: Myoglobin is inhibited by ______ (CO only, CO2 only, or both CO and CO2) Blank #6: Hemoglobin is inhibited by ______ (CO only, CO2 only, or both CO and CO2)

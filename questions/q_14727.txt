We want to work  the following problem:   A baker has 150 units of flour, 90 units of sugar, and 150 units of raisins. A loaf of raisin bread requires 1 unit of flour, 1 unit of sugar, and 2 units of raisins. A raisin cake requires 5 units of flour, 2 units of sugar, and 1 unit of raisins. If raisin bread sells for $1.75 a loaf and raisin cake sells for $4, how many loaves of raisin bread and how many raisin cakes should be baked so that the revenue is maximized? What is the maximum revenue?   Use the simplex method to answer the questions. You must show all work. This means that you must write an initial simplex tableau, you must show your final simplex tableau, and you must answer the questions in words, using complete sentences.   All I want you to type here is the complete sentence answer (how many loaves of raisin bread, how many loaves of raisin cakes, and what is the maximum revenue). Then, when you are finished with the test, upload your work to the Dropbox "Work for Test #3"

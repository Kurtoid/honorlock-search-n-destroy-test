*In corn, the allele for colored seeds (C) is completely dominant to the allele for colorless (c) seeds. Similarly, a single gene pair controls whether the endosperm is full (S) or shrunken (s). S is dominant to s. A true breeding colored full seeded plant was crossed with a colorless shrunken seeded one. The F1 was colored and full plants which were testcrossed to double recessive. The result was as follows: -Colored, full  4032 -Colored, shrunken  149 -Colorless, full  152 -Colorless, shrunken  4035 -Total  8368 Is there evidence that the gene for color and the gene of endosperm shape is linked? Choose the answer below that shows this evidence

An open rectangular tank 1.5 m wide, 2 m long, and 1.7 m high is three-fourth filled with oil, which has a specific gravity of 0.95. This tank is secured on a cart that is initially at rest. a. (35 points) Determine the location and the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the wetted front wall of the tank. b. (15 points) The cart moves slowly until it reaches a certain velocity. The cart is then deaccelerated at a constant deceleration of 4.5 m/s2, determine the amount of oil that will spill, and the location and the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the wetted front wall of the tank during deceleration. Data: Gravitational acceleration = 9.807 m/s2; density of water = 1000 kg/m3

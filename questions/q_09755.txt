The figure below shows tag and recapture data for 4 species that are common in our area: sandbar shark, spinner shark, tiger shark, and the scalloped hammerhead. Keep in mind that the arrows represent where the species was caught (the beginning of the arrow) and where it was eventually recaptured (the end of the arrow). Triangles represent animals that were recaptured less than 10 nautical miles from where they were originally tagged. Using these data, describe the population structure of populations of these 4 different species in the western North Atlantic (WNA) Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico (GoM).  I have placed labels for the WNA and GoM on the spinner shark map (just in case you need them).

How Should the Agency Proceed?  (25 points)   You are a senior lawyer at the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), a Cabinet agency which administers a number of statutes regulating the use of federal land.  One statute says that the Secretary of the Interior (that is, the agency) has the power to adopt "necessary and appropriate" regulations of mining on federal lands to promote "to promote clean and safe development of our Nation's mineral resources."   In a previous regulation published in 2017 (the 2017 Rule), the DOI required companies engaged in mining operations on federal land to file annual reports with DOI detailing what they were doing to protect water resources from contamination and the steps the companies were taking to comply with any state law requirements applicable to their operations.  However, the 2017 Rule explicitly rejected a request (made in many of the public comments) to require companies to obtain pre-clearance from DOI before beginning operations, and also rejected a request to require companies to conduct environmental impact studies before beginning mining operations.  The DOI explained at the time that it had rejected these two requirements because it had concluded, based on comments and data submitted from regulated companies, that the requirements would have imposed excessive compliance costs on the mining industry. A major environmental study conducted last year by a nonprofit environmental advocacy group concluded that mining operations on federal land are causing significant damage to water resources and other natural resources.   The Department now believes it is appropriate to replace its 2017 Rule with a new rule that will impose the two requirements that had previously been rejected.  The agency wishes to proceed with this new rulemaking in a way that will enable it to survive any legal challenge the mining industry may bring that would argue that the rule change is "arbitrary or capricious" under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  Q: How should the DOI proceed?  What steps should it take to protect this planned agency action from being set aside as contrary to the APA?  Be sure to discuss applicable legal standards as developed in the case law.

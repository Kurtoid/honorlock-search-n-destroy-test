1.4   Below is an extract explaining tuberculosis infection rates. Read it and answer the questions which follow. South Africa has the highest tuberculosis infection rate per population and accounts for 5% of the global TB burden. TB incidence has increased threefold between from 1996 to 2006, and by 2009 there were 406,000 cases. The incidence rate is estimated at 948 per 100,000. About 1.8% of new cases are Multiple-Drug Resistant (MDR) TB and about 6.7% of retreatment cases develop MDR. South Africa has the highest TB and HIV co-infection rate in the world at 73%. Tuberculosis is a leading cause of death for people living with HIV. HIV attacks one's immune system and makes them vulnerable to opportunistic infections. When a person infected with HIV contracts TB, latent TB infection progresses much quicker to active TB disease. While both conditions of tuberculosis are treatable for people living with HIV, special attention and awareness from health care workers are needed to prevent further complications associated with HIV-TB co-infection.

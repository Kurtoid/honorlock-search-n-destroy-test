The development of a preventative vaccine for HIV is on the horizon as pharmaceutical industries learned a lot from the COVID-19 vaccine development strategies. Just like for Covid-19, critical parts of the HIV's spike proteins are highly conserved and are also highly immunogenic. Additionally, the fact that these antigenic HIV spike parts are structurally accessible would enable the swift development of a prophylactic vaccine that would protect against all HIV-1/2 groups and subtypes. The only problem is the lack of HIV research funding to speed up this vaccine development process.

Answer the following question based on the following scenarioState surveyors are in the building and are performing the annual kitchen sanitation evaluation. Upon entering the kitchen, everyone puts on hair nets but you notice one of your kitchen aides does not have a beard cover on thus you hand him one. The surveyor washes her hands but is unable to get any hot water. As the temperatures of the food is being taken, the staff places the thermometer in one food item and then the next until all food items are tested. At the end she sanitizes the thermometer and places it back in its holder. You hand the surveyor the menu for the day which states meatloaf, mashed potatoes, green beans, roll, chocolate chip cookies, tea for lunch today. On the line, the cook is serving meatloaf, mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, roll, chocolate pudding, tea. The cook on the line has puffy eyes and appears miserable. She states she is feeling under the weather today. After lunch the surveyor observes staff washing dishes. She notices the wrong test strips are being used which test for iodine instead of chlorine. After the dishes go through the machine the employee puts the dishes away, stacking the wet dishes on top of each other. The employee is wearing gloves as they scrape the dishes, run them through the dish machine, and then put them away. On the way through the kitchen, the surveyor notices a container of butter packets setting under the serving line table. She also notices a bottle of bleach on the counter next to the microwave and several flies in the kitchen. 1. 1. Which of the following tags would most likely be issued upon inspection? a. F812 - no beard netb. F693 - menu not followedc. F800 - flies in the kitchend. F802 - inadequate nursing staff

An insurance company knows that in the entire population of millions of homeowners, the mean annual loss from fire is $500, and the standard deviation of the loss is $3000. The distribution of losses is strongly right-skewed: most policies have $0 loss, but a few have large losses. If the company sells 10,000 policies, what is the probability that it can safely base its rates on the assumption that its average loss will be no greater than $505? Select the best option in each case:  Is it possible to compute this probability? [color6]   If you decide it is not possible, select N/A in all cases. If you decide that is possible, you will need to compute a z-score with: an observed mean of [color1], a population mean (mean of the box) of [color2], a standard error of [color3]. The z-score is [color4], and the probability that it can safely base its rates on the assumption that its average loss will be no greater than $505 is  [color5]

One of our authors wrote a disturbing depiction of life on a slave ship. Using imagery, he wrote the following: "The stench of the hold while we were on the coast was so intolerably loathsome, that it was dangerous to remain there for any time, and some of us had been permitted to stay on the deck for the fresh air; but now that the whole ship's cargo were confined together, it became absolutely pestilential."

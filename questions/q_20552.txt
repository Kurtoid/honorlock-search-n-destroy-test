Many cancer cells acquire mutations in the gene for Ras. Recall that Ras is a monomeric G-protein that is a component of several signaling pathways including the growth pathway initiated by insulin binding the insulin receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase. If a mutation in the gene for Ras results in a Ras protein that has its intrinsic GTPase activity inactivated, what would be the result?

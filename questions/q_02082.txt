THIS IS THE LAST LONG ESSAY OPTION REMEMBER: YOU CANNOT ANSWER 7G IF YOU DID 13E IN PART 1. 7G.  Critically discuss the following argument:  In the case of 'purely informational beaming down' where the original (Kirk) is not         'disassembled', but simply is left as is (while having all his information read off into the machine),        the character on the ship - 'Ship-Kirk' - is the original Kirk, and so the 'Kirk' on the surface - 'Surface-        Kirk' is not (numerically identical to) Kirk. (You can call this Case One)    2 .So, in the 'ordinary' case of purely informational beaming down - where the original        is disassembled (Call this Case Two, or 'ordinary TT') - the guy on the surface is (still) not Kirk (from 1?).  In Case One, Ship-Kirk is Kirk, is responsible for Kirk's deeds, is married to Kirk's wife, etc.         (From 1?)  In Case One, Surface-Kirk is but a duplicate who is not responsible for Kirk's deeds, etc.         (From 2 and 3?) So? 5. In 'ordinary' TT, surface-Kirk does not even survive Kirk - he is a mere duped duplicate        (From 2 and/or 4?) So  6. Either Surface-Kirk is not psychologically connected with Kirk, or            psychological connectedness is not sufficient for survival. (From 5) Hypothesis: 7. Surface-Kirk doesn't have what matters because he is not Kirk: Identity is what matters. Every step in this argument (a) has some plausibility and (b) might be challenged (not all the challenges, of course, are independent of each other) (I think the inference from 5 to 6 is valid, though - but 6 presents two options which one might not have distinguished beforehand - so you might, for instance, discuss which of these two options is more plausible, if one gets this far in the argument.)(Question marks indicate inferences that might be questioned.) Obviously, there are pro-Parfit and anti-Parfit takes on this argument - which is targeted at (a) teletransportation, (b) psychological theories and (c) Parfit.  You don't have to discuss everything - just have some fun with it, and raise a bunch of relevant considerations/worries/retorts.

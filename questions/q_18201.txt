The half-life for carbon-14 to decay into nitrogen-14 is approximately 6,000 years. Suppose that you perform an isotopic analysis of a fossil, and you find a ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 that implies that 3/4 of the organism's original carbon-14 has decayed. That is, only 1/4 of the organism's original carbon-14 remains.  You could conclude that the organism

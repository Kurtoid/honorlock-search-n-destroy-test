(60 points) You want to investigate whether income assistance in the form of unemployment benefits helps unemployed workers to search for better paid jobs. Specifically, your aim is to find out whether longer benefit entitlement periods improve the search outcomes of unemployed workers. The data that is available for your study consist of observations on 500,000 unemployed workers, who are all eligible for benefits when they become unemployed.  You have detailed information on their labor market careers (employment, unemployment status and wages) during the last 5 years, their unemployment spell durations, and the start dates and wages of new jobs. In the data you can distinguish two groups of workers: one group is entitled to 20 weeks of benefits, and the second group is entitled to and an extended period of 30 weeks of benefits. The assignment to either group is based on work experience during the last 5 years before becoming unemployed: workers with less than 3 years of work experience are entitled to regular 20 weeks of benefits, and workers with 3 years or more of work experience are entitled to extended benefits of 30 weeks. The outcome variable you are interested in is wage growth i.e. the percentage difference between wage in the job they had before layoff and the job found after unemployment.

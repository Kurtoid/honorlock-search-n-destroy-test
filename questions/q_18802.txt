Not all red flags will result in a zero, but they will all be investigated to see if further action is necessary.   I understand that a thorough and proper room scan will provide greater context to red flags that may arise during my proctored testing session and that following the guidelines set forth for the Exam will greatly reduce the possibility of getting a zero.

An adolescent has suspected infectious mononucleosis after exposure to the virus in the past week. The Family Nurse Practitioner examines the adolescent and notes exudate on the tonsils, soft palate petechiae, and diffuse adenopathy. Which test will the Family Nurse Practitioner perform to confirm the diagnosis? correct answer: EBV-specific antibody testing EBV-specific IgG antibody testing is the specific serologic test for EBV infection. Heterophile antibody testing can be helpful in school-age children and adolescents after the first week of infection. A CBC can identify lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes but is non-specific. A throat culture is performed to identify bacterial causes; however, in this case of known exposure to EBV this would not be the appropriate confirmatory test.

Balance the following skeletal redox equation. You must use the half reaction method, showing your half reactions balanced first in acidic conditions. then combining to give the overall reaction balanced in BASIC conditions, as taught in our lecture. Show your work on your pdf upload for full credit.  You must show correct half reactions balanced first in acidic conditions in your work. D (doggonium) and Z (Zorkium) are fake elements. ZO31-  +  D(OH)3  -->    Z2O  +  DO31-  (in basic solution)  For each substance, type its coefficient in the first blank and  type left or right in any second blank (is the substance on the left or right side of the arrow in the equation?) If the coefficient is a 1 you must type it. If the substance is NOT in the overall reaction, type 0 for the coefficient (and neither in the second blank if any). The overall reaction  balanced in basic solution has? [water1] (coefficient) H2O on the [side1] (left or right) side, [H1] (coefficient) OH- on the [side2] (left or right) side, a coefficient of [b] for ZO31-  a coefficient of [a] for D(OH)3 a coefficient of [d] for Z2O a coefficient of [c] for DO31-
Problem #4 (25 points): a) The circuit shown below is a sinusoidal oscillator (assume the op-amp is ideal). Write the necessary equations to find the loop gain L(s) (do NOT solve for the loop gain). Note that at least one equation should contain L(s).  b) A sinusoidal oscillator has a loop gain given by:      If R = 4 k, find the values of the capacitance C and the resistance Rf to obtain sinusoidal oscillations at 5 kHz.

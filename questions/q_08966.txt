What do you call the particular viewpoint of a scene that appears to create an impossible image, like the image discussed in lecture, where numerous people appear to be holding the Leaning Tower of Pisa?
TBD Company manufactures and assembles drive shafts for automobiles. The company assembles the drive shafts for several accounts. The process consists of a lean cell for each customer. The following information relates to only one customer's lean cell. For the year, planned labor and overhead was $80,000,000 and materials costs were $25 per unit. Planned production included 9,600 hours to produce 76,800 drive shafts. Actual production for the month of August was 5,200 units, and drive shafts shipped amounted to 5,040 units. From the foregoing information, determine the cell conversion cost rate for applying conversion costs.

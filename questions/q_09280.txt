Emily, a Colorado resident in her 20th week of pregnancy, had been running a fever and experiencing muscle aches and diarrhea for the past two days. When she noticed bright red blood on her underwear she called her obstetrician, who instructed her to go to the hospital immediately. While in the emergency room, two sets of aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were taken. Unfortunately, during her exam a fetal heartbeat was not detected. Emily was most likely experiencing a miscarriage. Hospital staff put her on a combination antimicrobial therapy consisting of ampicillin and gentamycin. Blood cultures revealed that Emily had a Listeria monocytogenes infection. Laboratory analysis of fetal and placental tissue also revealed the presence of L. monocytogenes. Once stabilized, Emily was interviewed about the foods she had eaten for the four weeks prior to symptoms developing. While it was difficult for her to recall all food choices over such a lengthy time period, during the interview Emily's husband mentioned she had been craving fruit, especially cantaloupe. The interviewer asked a few more questions about the cantaloupe, and said that someone from the department of health might follow up with Emily. Local health authorities were starting to investigate the possibility of an outbreak of listeriosis. Listeriosis is a nationally notifiable foodborne illness caused by L. monocytogenes, a Gram-positive bacterium. The bacterium can be found in soil, water, and in a number of animals. About 10 percent of people carry L. monocytogenes asymptomatically in their intestinal tract. Forty other mammals and about 17 bird species also carry the bacterium. Any food can become contaminated with Listeria, but cooking and pasteurization kill the bacterium, so raw foods and/or foods that become contaminated after cooking are more commonly sources. Deli meats and hot dogs processed by contaminated packing equipment are prime sources for Listeria, as the bacteria can grow at refrigerator temperatures; these foods are often insufficiently heated before serving. Unpasteurized milk products and cheeses are also common sources. Less frequently, raw vegetables, fruits, prepared deli salads, smoked fish spreads, and meat pate are sources of infection. According to the CDC, about 800 laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis occur in the United States every year; most are asymptomatic. Clinical cases are mainly seen in pregnant women and the elderly. Pregnant women are 20 times more likely to become infected than nonpregnant healthy adults, likely due to the lowered cell-mediated immunity (selective immune suppression) that occurs in pregnancy. Listeriosis during pregnancy is especially dangerous since about 22 out of 100 perinatal listeriosis cases result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death. The incubation period for listeriosis ranges from 3 to 70 days, but symptoms usually appear within a month and can last several days to several weeks. Emily was one of 146 people affected by the Listeria outbreak in 2011 that killed 30 people. Among the 140 outbreak victims who were able to provide information on what they ate, 131 (94%) reported consuming cantaloupe within the month before becoming ill. Eventually all of the cases were linked to cantaloupes from Jensen Farms.    1. In general, what is the source of the pathogen L. monocytogenes?   [color1]  2.

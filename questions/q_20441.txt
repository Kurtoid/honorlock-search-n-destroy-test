Suppose that a farmer is growing wheat on 1 acre of land.  One year he plants a certain number of seeds and harvests a certain amount of wheat.  The following year, he decides to double the amount of seeds planted.  In return, he observes that his wheat harvest also doubled.  The farmer is amazed by the fact that he doubled the amount of seeds and it led to a doubling of the harvest!  He begins thinking to himself:  "It would be possible to feed the entire world population by simply growing more and more wheat on my land.  I could end world hunger as we know it!" Even if we assume an infinite supply of wheat seeds, why would this not be possible? Carefully construct an argument based on production economics in answering the question.  (Simply restating that it is not possible does not give credit).  Hint: seeds can be treated as a variable input; land can be treated as a fixed input.

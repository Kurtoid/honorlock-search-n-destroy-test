Problem 2 (10 points) Consider a medical test for a certain disease. If a person has the disease, the test results are positive with probability 0.95. If a person does not have the disease, the test results are negative with probability 0.9.  2.1 (6 points) Compute the test's predictive value as a function of the disease prevalence, namely p0s = np.linspace(0,1,100) (A test's predictive value measures the probability that a person has the disease given that they tested positive.). Your plot should include x-axis and y-axis label. 2.2 (4 points) From the list of p0s listed above, find the smallest prevalence for which the test predictive value is greater or equal than 80%. Your solution should not be based on the plot alone.

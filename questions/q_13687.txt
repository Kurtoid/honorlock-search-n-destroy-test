In the United States and Canada, bats use one of two strategies to survive winter. They either migrate south, or they hibernate. Recently, those that hibernate seem to have come under attack by a fungus, Geomyces destructans (Gd), an attack that is occurring from Missouri to New England, Canada, and even the state of Washington. Many infected bats have a delicate, white filamentous mat on their muzzles, which is referred to as white-nose syndrome (WNS). The fungus invades the bat tissues, causes discomfort, and awakens the bat from its hibernation. The bat fidgets and wastes calories, using up its stored fat. The bat then behaves abnormally, leaving its cave during daytime in winter to search for food. Their food, primarily insects, is scarce during the winter, and the bats ultimately starve to death. Since 2006, it is estimated that over six million bats have perished from WNS. The Gd mat on the fur of the bats should be expected to consist of ________.

Avidin is a protein found in the eggs of birds that binds biotin with high affinity and is a strong inhibitor of biotin-requiring enzymes (recall that biotin is a necessary coenzyme for CO2 transfers). You perform an experiment using liver cells that are capable of gluconeogenesis growing in culture.  You add each of the following (answers A, B, C, D, or E) as potential substrates (assume each is readily transported into the cell and/or mitochondria) and you measure the amount of glucose synthesized and record in your lab book that all these substrates will support glucose synthesis. For your test cultures, you add each of the substrates (answers A, B, C, D, or E) and include avidin in each culture. You measure the levels of glucose synthesized and record this in your lab book. Which substrate will NOT support synthesis of glucose in the presence of avidin?

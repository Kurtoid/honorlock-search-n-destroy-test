Use the standard reaction enthalpies given below to determine DHdegrxn for the following reaction: (5 points)      4 SO3(g)   4 S(s) + 6 O2(g)                  DHdegrxn =  ?   Given: SO2(g)   S(s) + O2(g)                           DHdegrxn = +296.8 kJ   2 SO2(g) + O2(g) - 2 SO3(g)     DHdegrxn = -197.8 kJ

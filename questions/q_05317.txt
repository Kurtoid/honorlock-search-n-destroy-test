What is not a seed quality standard set by the Association of Official Seed Analysts?
A review of voter registration records in a small town yielded the following table of the number of males and females registered as Democrat, Republican, or some other affiliation.         Gender     Affiliation   Male   Female     Democrat   300   600     Republican   500   300     Other   200   100         Suppose we wish to test the null hypothesis that there is no association between party affiliation and gender. Under the null hypothesis, what is the expected number of male Democrats?
BONUS: Determine whether the functions f(x) and g(x) are inverses using composition. Be sure to label each composition proof appropriately to receive credit.   f(x) = (x + 7)2 - 5 for x >= - 7                      g(x) =  - 7      x >= - 5    Show work and answer on your own paper and upload on the last problem of the test
You're trying to ride through a concrete banked curve while testing out a bike.  You estimate that the curve is banked 30o above the horizontal and the radius of curvature is  meters.  What is the constant velocity (in m/s) that you should ride through the curve without having to worry about the static friction between your tires and the concrete? (Remember to estimate g as 10 m/s2)

Errors in binary classification: Your classmate Charlie is a UF CS student who is doing undergraduate research at the Super Duper Awesome Deep Learning Lab (SDADLL). Researchers at the lab have trained a neural network model to predict the validity of any hypothesis formulated as an English sentence. Specifically, given any hypothesis such as: "job applicants who wear red on the day of the interview are 2.37% more likely to be hired than those who wear blue," or "left-handed individuals are faster at reading nonfiction books than right-handed individuals," the model outputs TRUE (+1) or FALSE (0). The network has 27651 layers and 7.1 quadrillion parameters and it was trained on 112 Exabytes of data. In this problem, you will help Charlie evaluate the performance of the model on real-world data.

Your patient was struck in the head with a six-inch-diameter tree branch while trimming a tree. He complained of dizziness immediately after the incident but states he "feels fine" now. The next day, he complains of dizziness and vomiting. You suspect a
The following events are from the novel Frankenstein, but they are out of sequence. Put the events in the proper chronological order (the order in which the events happened) by matching them with the correct number. For example, match whatever event occurred first with #1. The second event to occur should be matched with #2. And so on.

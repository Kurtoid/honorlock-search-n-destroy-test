Given a 5 by 5 matrix of all positive numbers, write a program to find and display the greatest product (multiplication) of the 3 adjacent numbers in the vertical direction. For example, in the matrix below, the greatest product of 3 adjacent numbers in vertical direction is 256 which is the product of mat(3,2) which is 8, mat(3,3) which is also 8 and mat(3,4) which is 4. Thus, 8*8*4 = 256, which is the largest for any such combination.     3   5   1   2   4 4   1   8   4   2 3   7   8   2   4 2   4   4   5   3 1   2   1   5   7   mat  = input('Enter a 5*5 matrix: ');

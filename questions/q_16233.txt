Essay 1 (Approximately 50-60 minutes - 35% of grade)          Moses and Patty Fleetwood were married in 1987.  On January 15, 1988, they purchased Flatacre, a rural parcel in the inland City of Holmes, from Linda Landowner for $100,000.  They recorded the deed on January 31, 1988.  As per their request, the grantor's quitclaim deed conveyed the property "to Moses and Patty Fleetwood and their heirs, as joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common."  On the parcel, the Fleetwoods opened an upscale pet shop in February 1988.              On June 1, 2010, Patty was stunned to come across a large "marine duck" wandering aimlessly on the street with its head rocking back and forth.  Having never seen one in Holmes, she throws a net over the bird and tosses him in the back of her delivery truck and brings it to the shop.  To turn around the truck after dropping off the giant bird, she backs the truck on to the parcel to the north of Flatacre.  The Fleetwoods, from the time they purchased Flatacre, have turned their truck around in this manner two or three times a day, depending on how many deliveries or pick-ups they need to make that day.          Moses is working at the store less and less, because he is spending increasing amounts of time gambling at Uston's Place, a nearby casino that welcomes card counters.  To raise funds to support his habit, he receives a loan of $5,000 on May 1, 2010 from his brother Paul in return for a mortgage on Flatacre.  Being more prudent than his brother, Paul immediately files a copy of the mortgage in the county land recording office.          The Fleetwoods' neighbor to the north is Oliver Olskoul, who has lived on his farm for 80 years.  In June of 2009, Oliver retires from farming and sells the farm to SpursCo, which proceeds to build a feedlot and feed processing plant on the former farm. SpursCo has the area surveyed and builds two of its buildings right up to one-fourth of an inch from the lot line as indicated in the survey.  Unbeknownst to the people at SpursCo, the survey has incorrectly located the lot line as being one-half inch south of its true location.  The Fleetwoods had commissioned a survey several years before, which indicated the true location of the lot line.  In June of 2010, Freddie Rem, the SpursCo foreman, notices that the Fleetwoods are using a portion of SpursCo's land to turn their truck around.  He demands that the Fleetwoods cease immediately.  Heated words are exchanged, whereupon the Fleetwoods inform Freddie that two of the SpursCo's buildings are located on Flatacre and that this trespass must cease immediately.          Meanwhile, on July 15, 2010, Oscar Renta drives by Flatacre and notices the pet shop.  He approaches Moses and asks what he is doing there.  When Moses informs him that Flatacre is the Fleetwoods' land, Oscar states in a loud voice that the parcel is his and that the Fleetwoods "had better clear out now." Two days later Oscar sends the Fleetwoods a photocopy of his deed dated October 5, 1986, with Linda Landowner as the grantor and Oscar as the grantee. Oscar recorded the deed on January 20, 1988.  The deed causes such surprise and dismay in Moses that he has a heart attack and dies.           To top off Patty Fleetwood's troubles, Avery Avian, a notorious local landlady, shows up on their doorstep.  She claims that the giant duck belongs to her and demands its return. Discuss and evaluate the possible claims of the various parties. Assume that the statute of limitations period relevant for adverse possession and prescription is 20 years and that the relevant jurisdiction has a recording act of the race-notice type.

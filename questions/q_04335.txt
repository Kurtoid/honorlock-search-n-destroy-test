True/False.  Enter T or F for statement.  (Do not enter the words "true" or "false".  Just the capital letter T or F) [1] Contributions in electrical engineering have made activities of daily life more comfortable, convenient, and connected. [2] Heating a semiconductor will increase the electron mobility. [3] Electrolytic capacitors are generally used for their very large capacitance values. [4] An electric charge sitting still (stationary) will accelerate when a magnetic field is applied. [5] Faraday's Law is useful for calculating the voltage induced in a coil by a time-varying magnetic field. [6] A time-varying current through a wire creates a static magnetic field. [7] Gauss' Law for Magnetics implies that there can be no magnetic monopoles (point sources of magnetic field). [8] Transformers are essential for achieving high power efficiency in large scale power systems. [9] The electrical phases of a three-phase generator are associated with three different coils (winding sets) positioned 120 degrees relative to each other inside the machine. [10] Load balancing is complicated for solar and wind farms due to intermittency issues.

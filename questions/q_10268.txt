Questions 1-9 refer to the following Case 1:  This patient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a history of a gradually progressive hearing loss in both ears, over the last 15 years.  He states that he has difficulty hearing, especially in groups and that he understands better when people speak more slowly.  This is the first complete hearing evaluation he has ever received.  Consider his history and the audiometric data below, and then answer the following questions about this case:           250 Hz     500 Hz     1000 Hz     2000 Hz     3000 Hz     4000 Hz     8000 Hz       Right Ear   Air Conduction     30 dB HL     35dB HL     40dB HL     55 dB HL     70 dB HL     70 dB HL     70 dB HL       Left Ear   Air Conduction      30 dB HL     30 dB HL     40 dB HL     55 dB HL     65 dB HL     70 dB HL     70 dB HL       Unmasked   Bone Conduction     25 dB HL     35 dB HL     35 dB HL     55 dB HL     65 dB HL     70 dB HL     ----------                 Otoscopy     Tympanograms     SRT     WRS       Right Ear     Non- impacted cerumen both ears     Type A both ears     45     76%       Left Ear     45     72%       Question 3:The most likely cause of his hearing loss is:

Assume the following list insertion code, which inserts into a list pointed to by the shared global variable head: int List_Insert(int key) {    node_t *n = malloc(sizeof(node_t));    if (n == NULL) { return -1; }    n->key=key;    n->next=head;    head=n;    return 0;} This code is executed by each of three threads exactly once, without adding any synchronization primitives (such as locks). Assuming malloc() is thread-safe (i.e., can be called without worries of data races) and that malloc() returns successfully, how long might the list be when these three threads are finished executing? (assume the list was empty to begin). Explain.

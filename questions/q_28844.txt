A random sample of 100 pumpkins is obtained and the mean circumference is found to be 40.5 cm. Assuming that the population standard deviation is known to be 1.6 cm, use a 0.05 significance level to test the claim that the mean circumference of all pumpkins is equal to 39.9 cm. Find the P-value for the indicated hypothesis test.

In each example, indicate whether intracellular signal would occur or would not occur by selecting the appropriate response from the dropdown box. A. Having a mutation in a signaling protein such that is not recognized by the RTK [Response1] B. Having a mutation that inhibited RTK dimerization [Response2] C. Having a mutation that eliminated RTK transphosporylation [Response3] D. Having a mutation that resulted in RTK dimerization in the absence of signal protein binding [Response4]

You recently attended a meeting where an investigator from a famous cancer hospital compared their outcomes of patients with stage IV lung cancer treated in the 1990s with carboplatin and taxol to those treated between 2000-2010 with the same chemotherapy plus an EGFR inhibitor. This showed a remarkable improvement in median survival for the latter group from 8months to 14months. The probability that this was due to chance was less than .00001. The investigator now suggests that this should be the new standard against which all future treatments are compared. You are concerned about the possible confounding variable of differences in imaging modalities between the 2 cohorts ask what percent of patients in each group were staged by CT alone and by PET/CT. The speaker acknowledges that they did not begin using PET/CT for evaluating lung cancer patients until about 2001. You point out this could skew the results of his comparison in favor of the more recently treated patients and that the survival benefits observed may be entirely an artifact. The audience applauds and the speaker is noticeably annoyed. The bias you are concerned about is called?

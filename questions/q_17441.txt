The absorbance vs wavelength profile of four different solutions is given below. The four solutions contain the identical solute but differ in solute concentration: 0.100 M, 0.150 M, 0.200 M and 0.250 M. All analyses are conducted in a 2.00-cm diameter cuvette.  Report your answer to each question or problem below. Make sure you reference your answers by numbering them according to the question or problem. You do not need to show calculations. 1. What is the value of lamda-max for the solution containing 0.150 M of the solute? (2 pts) 2. Use the plotting application made available to you and construct a calibration plot for a Beer's Law analysis performed at 700 nm. Report the value of the slope associated with the line of best fit. (4 pts) 3. If a solution of the solute has an absorbance reading of 0.682 at a wavelength of 700 nm, what is the molar concentration of the solute? (2 pts) 4. Report the value (including correct units) of the solute's molar absorptivity at 700 nm. (2 pts)

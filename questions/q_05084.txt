Before you took this course, you probably heard many stories about Statistics courses. Oftentimes parents of students have had bad experiences with Statistics courses and pass on their anxieties to their children. To test whether actually taking Statistics decreases students' anxieties about Statistics, a Statistics instructor gave a test to rate student anxiety at the beginning and end of his course. Anxiety levels were measured on a scale of 0-10. Here are the data for 9 randomly chosen students from a class of 180 students:    Student A B C D E F G H J   Pre-course anxiety level 7 5 9 5 6 7 5 7 6   Post-course anxiety level 4 3 7 3 4 5 4 6 5    Do the data indicate that anxiety levels about Statistics decrease after students take Statistics?  Choose the best answer for each of the following when testing appropriate hypotheses.         A.  [1] B.  [2] C.  [3] D.  [4] E.  [5]

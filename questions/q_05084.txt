Cache access involves virtual-to-physical address translation, cache tag comparison, and data array access. Assume in a particular processor architecture, its virtual and physical addresses have 40 and 32 bits respectively. The page size is 8 KB and the cache block size is 32 bytes. Assume that the TLB can record the recent 256 virtual-to-physical page address (page number) translations implemented with an 8-way set associative design. The cache size is 64KB with 4-way set-associative design. Observe the many empty parentheses in the image below. For each set of empty parentheses, you must fill in the width/size of the corresponding value in terms of bits (ie. the Virtual Address is 40 bits long, so the answer is 40). Use the information given above to deduce each value. Note:         The "Total size" in the diagram represents the total size (number of bits) of the entire tag or the data array.         The data array portion in TLB stores the physical page numbers.         Some values (such as tags) are repeated in the image, but are only listed once for you to fill in.          For numbers over 3 digits, DO NOT use commas in your answer.         You will need to find some answers in order to find others. You may even need to answer later values to find earlier ones, so don't hold yourself to the given order.

From the project, finish this method to determine if the player can move in the requested direction in the maze.      //This method should return true if the player can move in the direction and false otherwise. They should not be able to move "out of bounds". You can assume the maze is rectangular.   //currentX and currentY represent the player's x and y position   //requestedDirection is 'a' if left is requested, 's' if down is requested, and 'w' if up is requested. ('d' is omited intentionally.)   //mazeData   is a 2d array of ints.   //mazeData[x][y] is 0 if a wall is present   //mazeData[x][y] is 1 if a wall is not present   public boolean canMove(int currentX, int currentY, char requestedDirection, int[][] mazeData)    {   }

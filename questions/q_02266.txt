Dideoxynucleotide chain-termination sequencing, commonly known as Sanger sequencing, also revolutionized the field of genetics, as it provided a way to determine the sequence of DNA.  The process relies on a small amount of dideoxynucleotides that is added to the reaction.  The dideoxynucleotides contain a unique fluorescent label corresponding to each nucleotide.  The dideoxynucleotides (shown below) also have a hydrogen at the 3' carbon instead of a hydroxyl group.  During DNA synthesis, this modification causes the polymerase reaction to ______.

You can use MATLAB either through UF Apps or if you have student license downloaded version of it. Here is the link for UF Apps: https://info.apps.ufl.edu/ For a given phrase, write a program which swaps the first letters of the words in such a way that the first letter of the first word is swapped with the first letter of the last word. The first letter of the second word is swapped with the first letter of the second last word. Similarly, the first letter of the third word is swapped with the first letter of the third last word and so on.  For example, the phrase = 'The quick Brown Fox here' changes to 'hhe Fuick Brown qox Tere'. Here, the first letter of the first word 'T' swaps with the first letter of the last word 'h', the first letter of the second word ('q') swaps with the first letter of second last word ('F') and so on. Note that there can be even or odd number of words present in the phrase.  phrase = input('Enter the phrase: ', 's');   Test Case 1: Enter the phrase: The quick Brown fox hereThe new phrase : hhe fuick Brown qox Tere Test Case 2: Enter the phrase: Here is all that You needThe new phrase : nere Ys tll ahat iou Heed Test Case 3: Enter the phrase: X Y ZThe new phrase : Z Y X Test Case 4: Enter the phrase: While he was out it was Raining heavilyThe new phrase : hhile Re was iut ot was haining Weavily Test Case 5: Enter the phrase: May the Force be with You alwaysThe new phrase : aay Yhe worce be Fith tou Mlways

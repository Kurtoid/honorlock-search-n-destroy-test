You have an older car that is paid for but requires work a couple of times a year.  You figure it costs about $800 per year in repairs and about $900 per year in gas.  A late model used car that gets better fuel economy will cost, with interest on the loan, $16,700 and require about $480 per year for fuel.  This car is not expected to require any repairs for many years other than the usual oil changes, tires, brakes, etc that would be required for either car.  How many years will it take for the newer car to really start saving you money?  Report your answer to the number of years rounded to the tenth.  Do NOT report any words with you number of years.

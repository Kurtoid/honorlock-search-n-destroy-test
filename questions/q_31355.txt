A 46-year-old woman with a 10-year history of primary progressive multiple sclerosis is admitted to the hospital for surgical debridement and wound management of a sacral pressure ulcer. The patient is bed bound and is cared for at home by her husband. Her medications are sertraline, baclofen, and oxybutynin. The remainder of the medical history is noncontributory.   On physical examination, she is thin, is in no distress, and has normal vital signs. There are contraction deformities of the lower extremities, and a 6- x 8-cm sacral ulcer that extends to the fascia with minimal purulent exudates and no evidence of cellulitis. Laboratory studies include a hematocrit of 34%, leukocyte count of 15,000/uL with 80% neutrophils, and a platelet count of 425,000/uL. All other laboratory studies are normal. Subcutaneous prophylactic unfractionated heparin is administered. Six days after initiation of heparin, her platelet count decreases to 210,000/uL, and on the ninth day after therapy, the platelet count has decreased to 95,000/uL. The peripheral blood smear shows decreased platelets but is otherwise normal. There is no evidence of bleeding from venous puncture sites or the wound.   Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

This is the same fact pattern as that above - Problem 6 part C. Doug has an outside basis of $20,000 in his partnership interest. He receives an operating distribution of $10,000 cash, and his share of partnership liabilities decrease by $8,000. He also receives inventory 1 with an inside basis of $5,000 (FMV = $5,000) and inventory 2 with an inside basis of $18,000 (FMV = $10,000). Use the information in Part A, but assume Doug's outside basis is $45,000 in his partnership interest. Use the same information in Part B, which builds on Part A, but assume that the distribution is a liquidating distribution instead of an operating distribution. What is Doug's outside basis after the liquidating distribution? [A] What is the amount and character (if any) of any recognized gain or loss to Doug? [B] What is his basis in each of the assets he receives? Cash = [C] Inventory 1 = [D] Inventory 2 = [E]

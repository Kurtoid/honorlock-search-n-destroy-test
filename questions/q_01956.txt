Because he's sure that developing guitar prowess will lead to riches - or at least critical acclaim in indie circles - he derives $500 in surplus from being able to practice.  Dean's practicing, however, is quite loud and can be heard clearly through paper-thin walls in his hip Brooklyn apartment.  Britta lives next door and likes to read, but she is unable to do so when Dean plays guitar.   She gets $350 in surplus from the satisfaction of reading.  Suppose that when Dean and Britta bargain, they always split any surplus to be divided evenly.

A restaurant is using a new sign that lights up a shape depending on the binary sequence received in 3 inputs. To light up a taco shape requires 101, to light up a burger shape requires 110, to light up a pizza shape requires 001, and to light up a shake shape requires 010. The amount of time the shape stays on and off is the same. The time to switch from one shape to another is fixed and constant. In other words, a single clock pulse will be sufficient.  Implement digital circuit design for the control unit for this sign so that the sign shows the shapes from burger to pizza to shake to taco before it starts repeating in that order. Additionally, it must be implemented using D-flipflops, and your answer must include:   The state graph (be detailed and contain all proper directions, labels, and values) The truth tables (needs to include the truth table for the next state and truth table for the logic for the flip flops) The K-maps for the next state equation and the K-maps for the logic gates connected to the flipflops Determine the optimal SoP next state equations and the optimal SoP equations for the logic gate(s) connected to the flipflops Lastly, draw the digital circuit of the control unit all the way to the outputs that will be connected to the sign

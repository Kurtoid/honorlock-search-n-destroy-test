Which of the following is/are a type of primary data?
You are given an array  of   distinct integers (indexed 1 through ) which are not arranged in any particular order. The objective is to determine the largest and the second largest  of these  integers (without sorting the whole array). Observe that the problem is trivial if  For the sake of simplicity, you can assume that   is a power of two. Develop an algorithm based on the divide and conquer principle to do so and express it in the form of pseudocode. Specifically, write a recursive function   that returns the largest  and second largest integer  in the portion of the array starting from index  to   using the divide and conquer principle.  Note that we can solve the original problem, by simply calling your function with parameters of  No need to analyze your algorithm.

When the hair is cultured, a white cottony mold grows at 25degC on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar. Microscopically rare microconidia, septate hyphae and terminal chlamydospores are seen. Macroconidia are absent. The mold fails to grow on polished rice grains.The causative agent is:

The essay below begins with a(n) If the entire human species were a single individual, that person would long ago have been declared mad. The insanity would not lie in the anger and darkness of the human mind--though it can be a black and raging place indeed. And it certainly wouldn't lie in the transcendent goodness of that mind--one so sublime, we fold it into a larger "soul." The madness would lie instead in the fact that both of those qualities, the savage and the splendid, can exist in one creature, one person, often in one instant. -Adapted from Jeffrey Kluger, "What Makes Us Moral," Time, 12.3.07, p. 55.

Assume that an industrial building can be purchased for $1,500,000 today, is expected to yield cash flows of $80,000 for each of the next five years (with the cash flows occurring at the end of each year), and can be sold at the end of the fifth year for $1,625,000. Calculate the internal rate of return (IRR) for this transaction.

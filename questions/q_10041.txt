The antigen/s on his red blood cells is/are: [31] (31: enter them all no commas or periods or spaces); The antibody/ies in his blood is/are: [32] (32: enter them all no commas or periods or spaces). What are 2 blood types that he can safely receive: [33] (33: enter them both no commas or periods or spaces)? What is 1 blood type he cannot safely receive: [34] (34)? What would happen if you gave him this unsafe blood type:[35] (35)?     A. Give him an isosmotic solution   F. Rh antigens   K. Type A-   P. Type O+   U. The antibodies from the donated blood would stick to the antibodies in his blood     B. Give him a hyperosmotic solution   G. Anti A   L. Type B+   Q. Type O-   V. The antibodies on his red blood cells would stick to the antigens on the donated red blood cells     C. Give him a hyposmotic solution   H. Anti B   M. Type B-   R. The antibodies in his blood would stick to the antigens on the donated red blood cells         D. A antigens   I. Anti Rh   N. Type AB+   S.

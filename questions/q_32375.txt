ABC Company produces a single product called a Pong. ABC Company has the capacity to produce 60,000 Pongs each year. If ABC Company produces at capacity, the per unit costs to produce and sell one Pong are as follows:       Direct materials   $15     Direct labor   $12     Variable manufacturing overhead   $8     Fixed manufacturing overhead   $9     Variable selling expense   $8     Fixed selling expense   $3       The regular selling price for one Pong is $80. A special order has been received by ABC Company from XYZ Company to purchase 6,000 Pongs next year. If this special order is accepted, the variable selling expense will be reduced by 75%.

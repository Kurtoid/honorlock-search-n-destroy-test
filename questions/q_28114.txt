All tests have deadlines but can be taken early. See Canvas for an Honorlock tutorial and how to set up the program. A webcam will be required.     You must have photo identification (LCC student ID, or driver's license) with you when you log in to Honorlock.      Access Honorlock through Canvas on the test page. You can find this in modules for that unit. You must complete the exam in one sitting. Turn in all scratch paper in Canvas within 10 minutes of completing your exam. Show all of your work on your scratch paper. Label it clearly so you can get partial credit for good work even if the final answer is incorrect! Scratch paper is REQUIRED to be turned in. A test grade will not be submitted in Canvas without scratch paper. The scratch should show the steps for a problem. If there are no steps shown on problems that require steps, you might be asked to a video conference to discuss the results.      There will be no cell phone use for any reason. Put your phone away! Any use of electronic devices will be considered cheating. Honorlock will flag any suspicious behaviour and then I have to go back and watch your exam. This isn't fun so please keep everything put away.      Answer the following- When you take the test, nobody will watch your room scan to make sure you don't have a cell phone or notes near you.

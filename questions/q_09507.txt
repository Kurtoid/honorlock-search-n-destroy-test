For each of the following sentences, fill in the blanks with the best word or phrase selected from the list below. Not all words or phrases will be used; each word or phrase should be used only once.For an uncharged molecule, the direction of passive transport across a membrane is determined solely by its 1__________________ gradient. On the other hand, for a charged molecule, the 2__________________ must also be considered. The net driving force for a charged molecule across a membrane therefore has two components and is referred to as the 3__________________ gradient. Active transport allows the movement of solutes against this gradient. The transporter proteins called __4________________ transporters use the movement of one solute down its gradient to provide the energy to drive the uphill transport of a second gradient. When this transporter moves both ions in the same direction across the membrane, it is considered a(n) _5_________________; if the ions move in opposite directions, the transporter is considered a(n) 6__________________. anti-port    coupled            membrane potentialATP hydrolysis    electrochemical    symportconcentration    light-driven    uniport Please write down best word or phrase selected from the list above in the order as listed.

Problem Q1.5: For the system shown below, determine the values of the terms in the stiffness matrix. Given:  k=1 N/m      Q1.5a.  Provide the numerical answer in units:  N/m k11 = [k11] ? k12 = [k12] ? k21= [k21] ? k22= [k22] ?
Complete the following code snippet, which is intended to be a recursive method that will find the sum of all elements in an array of double values from the beginning of the array to index: // return the sum of all elements in arr[] public static double findSum(double arr[], int index) {  if (index == 0)  {  _____________________  }  else  {  return (arr[index] + findSum(arr, index - 1));  } } Assume that this method would be called using an existing array named myArray as follows: findSum(myArray,myArray.length - 1);

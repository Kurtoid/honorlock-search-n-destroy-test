Sulfa drugs like Bactrim, given for bacterial infections, inhibit bacteria by blocking folic acid synthesis.  The precursor molecule of folic acid is para-amino benzoic acid (PABA).  Interestingly, PABA has a structure very similar to Bactrim.  If Bactrim is present in greater quantities than PABA, the bacterial enzyme will bind to it (through its active site) because of the structural similarity between each.  This  is how the enzyme will be prevented from synthesizing essential folic acid in bacteria. This is an example of:

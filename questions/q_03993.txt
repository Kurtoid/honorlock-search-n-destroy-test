Emmett consumes speeches by politicians and university administrators. He is paid $1 per hour for listening to politicians and $2 per hour for listening to university administrators. (Emmett is in great demand to help fill empty chairs at public lectures because of his distinguished appearance and his ability to refrain from making rude noises.) Emmett consumes one good for which he must pay. We have agreed not to disclose what that good is, but we can tell you that it costs $15 per unit and we shall call it Good X. In addition to what he is paid for consuming speeches, Emmett receives a pension of $50 per week. Write down a budget equation stating those combinations of the three commodities, Good X, hours of speeches by politicians (P), and hours of speeches by university administrators (A) that Emmett could afford to consume per week.
You have been called to a client's 2,000-head finisher site to determine the cause of acute deaths in several of his finisher pigs. On arrival at the farm, you note that the pigs are 4-5 months old, there have been 5 deaths since the farmer left the site yesterday afternoon and that there are about 15-20 pigs that are obviously ill just on cursory observation. The most severely affected of these have been anorexic, you estimate, for about 24 hours based on body condition. They are dyspneic, lethargic and have large, contiguous areas of purple discoloration on the skin of the ears and lower abdomen. Rectal temperatures are as high as 105-106. You decide to euthanize and necropsy two of the pigs and observe lungs with a diffuse pneumonia with some fibrinous pleuritis present. The most striking lesions, however, are in the large intestine, including a greatly enlarged colon and mesentery with a serosal surface that looks almost edematous. When you open the colon, it looks like the pig has read the textbook, with very distinct appearing "button ulcers" in the mucosal surface.    You tell the client that the most likely diagnosis is:
V2 branches into the Greater Palatine, which is afferent to the mucosa of the hard palate.

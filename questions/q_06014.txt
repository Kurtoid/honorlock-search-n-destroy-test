Imagine that you have been asked to solve a problem this summer for the CTO of some large communication giant who realizes that he no longer has any machine learning researchers on staff. The problem involves a virtual agent with a set of virtual actuators and virtual but real-valued (continuous) sensors. Your client doesn't know how to describe what he wants the agent to do, but he definitely knows when it has done well or poorly. (a) Formally describe this as a reinforcement learning problem. Also, explain why it isn't well-modeled as a supervised learning problem. While you're at it, explain your actual methodology: how will you set up the problem? How will you train? How will you know that you're doing well? What assumptions will you make? How will you choose the various free parameters of your algorithm (so, yes, you'll have to pick an algorithm)? (b) Your client now wants to be sure that he gets his money's worth, and so demands that you also use unsupervised learning. You are ethical, so you want to use some algorithm in a reasonable and useful way. Given the details of this particular problem, how might you actually use unsupervised learning here to some good effect? Be specific: commit to an algorithm (or two or three) and explain what you would hope to get out of its use. (c) What will likely happen to the quality of your agent if you wait until the last month of the summer to really start working on your client's problem? Be specific. Feel free to draw from recent personal experience.

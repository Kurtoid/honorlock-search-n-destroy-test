What are the polarities of CH2Cl2 and CF2Cl2?                                      Data sheet and Periodic Table

The ranger pointed out to Orphy, Gazebo, and the other visitors that the spring water also contained strontium (element 38, the alkaline earth that lies two rows above radium in the periodic table), and that the strontium included the most common stable isotope, strontium-88, plus radioactive isotopes such as strontium-83 (which he said decayed by positron emission) and strontium-90 (which he said decayed by beta emission).  Orphy spoke up and said that he wasn't surprised by these differences in decay mechanisms.  Can you briefly explain why Orphy might have anticipated these two different decay paths for these two specific isotopes?

Scientists have discovered a synthesis pathway for a novel amino acid in a bacterium found in the gut microbiome. Which of the following would be the primary allosteric inhibitor of synthesis of this novel amino acid? Hint: this is an example of feedback inhibition.
Suppose your observe plants of a particular species growing both at the top and the bottom of a hill. You notice that the plants at the bottom of the hill are very tall, whereas the plants at the top of the hill are quite short. You collect seeds from both the plants growing at the top and the bottom of the hill. When you plant the seeds and grow the offspring in a greenhouse, giving all the plants the same amount of water and fertilizer, you notice that the plants all grow to a tall height. In other words, there is no difference between the "top of hill" and "bottom of hill" offspring. You would hypothesize that the short height of plants growing at the top of the hill in nature is due to:

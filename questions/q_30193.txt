Design an Armstrong FM modulator to generate an FM with a carrier frequency of 200 MHz, the message signal is bandlimited to B=20 kHz and frequency deviation of 100K Hz. A narrow-band FM generator is available at a carrier frequency of 100 KHz and a frequency deviation of 100 Hz. The stock room has an oscillator with frequency up to 3 Mhz, a LPF with adjustable frequency band up to 4.5MHz, and four frequency multipliers (one double (2), one Quintupler (5) and two (10)s). (1) Fill in the blanks for Frequency multipliers M1[M1],  M2[M2] ,   Modulation index=[index],  cut off frequency=[Band]  KHZ. {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 20, 22, 40, 50, 200, 250, 500 } [hint cut off frequency is carrier frequency + Carson bandwidth/2. Sketch the following  design and spectrum and submit them in Question 5, 3 pt total. (2) Draw diagram and show all design parameters for example, central frequency and bandwidth for BPF, frequency of oscillator, and frequency multipliers (3pts)

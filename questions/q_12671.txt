Using the following equation for the combustion of octane, calculate the heat associated with the combustion of excess octane with 100.0 g of oxygen assuming complete combustion. The molar mass of octane is 114.33 g/mole. The molar mass of oxygen is 31.9988 g/mole. 2 C8H18 + 25 O2 - 16 CO2 + 18 H2O DHdegrxn = -11018 kJ

A population of four o'clocks is being studied to see if it is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  Recall that in four o'clocks flower color is determined as follows:RR = redRr = pinkrr = white Let:p = frequency of R alleleq = frequency of r allele You count 100 plants total: 36 plants with red flowers, 48 plants with pink flowers, and 16 plants with white flowers.What is the value of "p" (the frequency of R) for this population?

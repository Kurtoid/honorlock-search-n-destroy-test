Carbon monoxide is toxic because it bonds much more strongly to the iron in hemoglobin (Hgb) than oxygen does . Consider the following reactions and approximate standard free energy changes: Hgb  +  O2  - HgbO2      DGrxno = -70 kJ/mol{"version":"1.1","math":"Hgb  +  O2  - HgbO2      DGrxno = -70 kJ/mol"} Hgb  +  CO  -  HgbCO        DGrxno = -80 kJ/mol{"version":"1.1","math":"Hgb  +  CO  -  HgbCO        DGrxno = -80 kJ/mol"} Using these data, estimate the equilibrium constant value at 10degC for the following reaction: HgbO2   +  CO  =   HgbCO  +  O2{"version":"1.1","math":"HgbO2   +  CO  =   HgbCO  +  O2"}

An association was formed by students to protest labor exploitation in the apparel industry. There were 18 student  "sit-ins" for a  "sweat-free campus" organized at several universities. Data were collected for the duration  (in days) of each  sit-in, as well as the number of student arrests. The data for 5  sit-ins in which there was at least one arrest and the results of a simple linear regression are found below. Let y be the number of arrests and x be the duration.    (a) Use the results of the linear regression to find the least squares prediction equation.  (Type an integer or decimal rounded to three decimal places as  needed.) No spaces between symbols. y = [Q11_1] (b) Give a practical interpretation of the  y-intercept of the least squares line. If a practical interpretation is not  possible, explain why.   [Q11_2]    A.  Since a  sit-in with duration 0 is outside the range of the sample  data, the  y-intercept has no practical interpretation.   B.  Since a  sit-in with 0 arrests is outside the range of the sample  data, the  y-intercept has no practical interpretation.   C.  For each additional  arrest, the duration is estimated to change by the value of the slope. D. For each additional one day  duration, the number of arrests is estimated to change by the value of the  y-intercept.

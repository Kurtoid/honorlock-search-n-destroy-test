A clean dry crucible weighs 51.024 g. A sample of an unknown metal is added to the dish so that the total mass of the crucible and metal is 58.374 g. The crucible is heated until the metal starts burning and it is allowed to burn until the reaction is complete, producing a single product. After heating the mass of crucible and product is 60.925 g. For each answer, enter the VALUE and UNIT with one space between them. Round each answer if needed to show correct sig figs, but use unrounded values in subsequent steps. You must show your work with sig figs, units and circled answers in your upload for full credit. What is the mass of the metal before heating? [metal] What is the mass of the product?

Isberg Industries has $150,000 of debt and 7,500 shares of common stock that trade at $80 per share.  The company also has $22,500 of excess cash and its EBIT = EBITA = $25,000.  All cash is considered excess cash, and the book value of debt equals the market value of debt.  The company also reports $40,000 in minority interest (i.e., another party owns a minority stake in one of its subsidiaries). A leading analyst uses an EV/EBITA ratio to value stocks, and she estimates that the average multiple for peer companies in Isberg's industry is 25.

Assuming that Isberg is a "typical" company among its peers, what would the analyst predict to be its target stock price?

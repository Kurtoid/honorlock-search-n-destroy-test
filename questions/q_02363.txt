In male redback spiders, males perform an amazing self-sacrificing behavior in which, during mating, males flip their bodies over so that they rest in front of the jaws of the female, who typically will begin cannibalizing the males while copulation is ongoing.  Males who perform this behavior are able to transfer substantially more sperm to females than males who copulate without this self-sacrificing behavior.  Males are quite small relative to females, and females are typically very widely distributed.   Explain how this extreme behavior may have evolved, comparing males who make this "terminal investment" in one female vs. males who don't self-sacrifice and instead attempt to mate with multiple females.

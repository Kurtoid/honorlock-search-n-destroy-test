Consider the following payoff table where d1,d2, and d3 represent the available decisions and s1, s2 and s3 represent the possible states of nature.  The numbers in the table represent profits.           s1   s2   s3     d1   3000   1200   1500     d2   1000   1800   1400     d3   5000   500   1200        Assume that we have no information about the probabilities of the states of nature, s1,s2,s3.  Use the Maximax approach to choose a decision Use the maximin approach to choose a decision   Assume now that we have probability estimates for these states as follows p(s1) = .2, p(s2)  = .3, p(s3) = .5  Using the expected value approach, which decision should be chosen.

5. A professor at Santa Fe College for STA2023 collected data from one of her classes in the Fall of 2017 to investigate the relationship between study time per week (average number of hours) and college GPA. The data for males in her class is given below:     Study hours per week   5   6   10   12   13   15   21   25     GPA (grade point average)   2.7   3.0   3.1   3.3   3.2   3.4   3.8   3.6     Find the equation of the regression line using the least squares approach.  You may use the appropriate procedure in your calculator to help you find the solution.  Clearly label, the slope, the y-intercept and the regression equation. (b) What is the y-intercept?
11. In 2004, a random sample of 46 coyotes in a region of northern Minnesota showed the average age to be 2.05 years with a standard deviation of 0.82 years.  However, it is thought that the overall population mean age of coyotes is 1.75 years.  Test the hypothesis that coyotes in this region of northern Minnesota live longer than the average of 1.75 years.  (While answering the following sub-parts of this question, you will be including the null and alternative hypothesis, the test statistic, the p-value (a visualization and an interpretation), your statistical decision, and your conclusion in the context of the problem.) (c) Interpret the p-value for Step 3 of the hypothesis test.

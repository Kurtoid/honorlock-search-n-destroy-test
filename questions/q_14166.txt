The boiling point of an aqueous 1.83 m (NH4)2SO4 (molar mass = 132.15 g/mol) solution is 102.5degC. Determine the value of the van't Hoff factor for this solute if the Kb for water is 0.512degC/m.
Prove the following statement using a proof by cases.   [Hint: there are 3 cases] "For all positive integers n <= 3, n! <= n2."  Use good proof technique.   Grading rubric:1 pt. State any givens and assumptions.3 pt. Clearly identify the cases and prove each case.1 pt. State the final conclusion at the end of the proof. Note:  Remember that n factorial, written as n!, is defined as n(n-1)...(2)1, the product of n times every positive integer less than n.  To avoid the need for typing superscript exponents, you may use the expression 'n-squared' or 'n^2' to represent n2.  Also the <= symbol can be written as

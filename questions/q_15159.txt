The following question pertains to the original passage and citation below:     Wilbur, Richard. "The Three Privations of Emily Dickinson." Literature: An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, and Drama, edited by X. J. Kennedy and Dana Gioia, Pearson, 2010, pp.969-70.   An original passage from page 1111 of the excerpted essay by Wilbur: "That hers was a species of religious personality goes without saying; but by her refusal of such ideas as original sin, redemption, hell, and election, she made it impossible for herself--as [biographer George F.] Whicher observed--'to share the religious life of her generation.'  She became an unsteady congregation of one."   Evaluate the following attempt by a student writer to use details from the passage above; choose the option that best describes the student's attempt to paraphrase the secondary source.  Student Writing: Many scholars, including Richard Wilbur, agree that although Dickinson felt a need for a religious faith, she could not accept some common Christian beliefs (Wilbur 1111).

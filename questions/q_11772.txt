Exam Policies  You are allowed to use Quartus II to write, compile, and test your code for this final exam question. You are not allowed to open files related to past work of any kind during the exam.  You should not be seen viewing code from lecture or a previous lab experiment during the exam. You are not allowed to use any outside resources during the exam.  This includes: internet searches, the textbook (hard or soft copy), prior lab reports, another student's work, another person, notes, lecture material, cell phones/tables/other electronic devices.

If screen sharing is voluntarily ceased, your exam will be penalized with a loss of points, with a maximum penalty of a final exam score of 0 points.   Problem Statement Using an FSM, build an electronic combination lock with a reset button, two number buttons (0 and 1), and an unlock output. The combination should be 01011.  When the user enters the correct combination, the output "unlock" should be high.  Otherwise, this output should be low. Write a complete VHDL design description for this event detector, as a two-process or three-process FSM.   Use the following entity declaration for your design. entity combolock isport(    clock: in std_logic;     reset: in std_logic;     code : in std_logic;     unlock: out std_logic );end combolock; Exam Submission  Write, compile, and functionally simulate your design in Quartus II. Upload a text file of your code to Canvas.  Code should include a header with your name, course, and date. Upload a screen shot of your functional simulation results to Canvas.

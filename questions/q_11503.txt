An 8-pole, 50 Hz, three phase, Y-connected synchronous motor, rated at 440V, line-line, has a synchronous reactance of 2.5O.  Neglect the stator resistance.  Assume the motor is always operated at rated voltage and frequency, and that the motor is magnetically linear.  It is known that with a field current of 4.5 A, Eaf is equal to the rated stator voltage. a) Determine the field current which will result in the motor operating with a stator line current of 22 A, and a power factor of 0.84 leading. b) For the conditions of part (a), determine the torque. c) Determine the magnitude and phase angle of stator current if the field current is 4.1 A and the stator (all 3 phases) is short-circuited.

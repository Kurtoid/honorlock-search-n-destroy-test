After reading the following passage, choose the letter of the best answer to each question.                 Suppose a man works six or seven days a week in a factory, trying to support his family, but never seems to be able to make ends meet.

He doesn't really know them, but he suspects they're willing to work for low wages and that many other immigrants are eager to take his job.  By a process of twisted logic, he blames these people for his poverty.  Soon he is exchanging rumors about "them" with his cronies and supporting efforts to close the border.  Hating immigrants makes the man and his friends feel a little better.   _______32. We can infer that the author of the passage thinks

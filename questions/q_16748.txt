For the CMOS Design problem where several parameters are being asked to be calculated utilize the same details and values.  Please read the 1st one and know that all questions are written out there so you work off that  information on the whole problem on your papers and once done, you just click your right answer choice from the multiple choices for each of the problems that follow individually where one of the several parameters is asked to be found.                              .                                             . While designing a CMOS integrated circuit, you are considering reducing the supply voltage from 3.3V to 1.1V.  You would like to assess the impact this reduction in power supply does to your design. Your process is found to have a 70fF capacitive load.  The switching frequency is 1.5GHz. Consider that the device has 10 inverter circuits in the inetgrated circuit. Include proper units for full credit and show your work.  Unless otherwise specified and if appropriate, give an equation and a number answer. (i)  What is the  dynamic power for the 3.3 V and 1.1 V supplies?  (6pts) (ii) By reducing the input power supply, did the total power for the design increase or decrease? How many times did it increase or decrease? (2pts)(iii)  If the resistances of the NMOS and PMOS transistors are 6kO and 15kO respectively, what is the propagation delay of the CMOS inverter for the output going high to low tpHL and low to high  tpLH? (4pts)      (iv) If the process is 45nm and you chose the supply voltage as 1.1V,  Vtn = -Vtp = 0.4V and (W/L)n = 1.8 and  mnCox= 2.5mpCox.   Find Wp (width of the P device) that results in VM = VDD/2 meaning the inverter is matched Find the values of VOH, VOL,VIH , VIL , NML, and NMH     (10 pts) Mark all these values on the VTC   (i)  What is the dynamic power for the 3.3 V and 1.1 V supplies?  (6pts)

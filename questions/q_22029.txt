Fibroblasts initially produce a thin, weak-structured collagen with no consistent organization, known as ___________________. This period is the most tenuous time during the healing process because of the limited tensile strength of the tissue. During the proliferation phase, an injured area has the greatest amount of collagen, yet its tensile strength can be as low as 15% of the tensile strength of normal tissue.
Hypertension (elevated blood pressure) is a potentially dangerous condition that puts strain on the cardiovascular system. Calcium channel blockers are often prescribed. These drugs reduce Ca2+ movement through Ca2+ channels, are often prescribed to relieve hypertension. These can act on smooth muscle, and cardiomyocytes: both contractile and autorhythmic. How do Ca2+ channel blockers reduce blood pressure by acting on contractile cardiomyocytes?

Problem #4 (25 points): A 3D (bulk) semiconductor has a Eg=0.8eV, mn=0.052m0 and mh=0.46m0.  If the electron Fermi level is 60meV above the conduction band edge and the hole Fermi level is 20meV below the valance band edge:     A) What is the absorption for a transition energy of 0.78eV? B) Calculate just the Fermi term (1-f(Ec)-f(Ev)) in the absorption equation for a transition energy of 0.84eV. C) Repeat B) for a transition energy of 0.9eV. D) Explain physically why these results of A), B), & C) are obtained, and also what the result of B) and C) mean in terms of what the absorption will be at these transition energies.

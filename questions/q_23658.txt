Please use the following information to answer the question(s) below.For several decades now, amphibian species worldwide have been in decline. A significant proportion of the decline seems to be due to the spread of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Chytrid sporangia reside within the epidermal cells of infected animals, animals that consequently show areas of sloughed skin. Infected animals can also be lethargic, which is expressed through failure to hide and failure to flee. The infection cycle typically takes four to five days, at the end of which zoospores are released from sporangia into the environment. Zoospores are spores of fungi (as well as some algae and protozoans) that use a flagella for swimming locomotion. In some amphibian species, mortality rates approach 100%; other species seem able to survive the infection.If infection primarily involves the outermost layers of adult amphibian skin, and if the chytrids use the skin as their sole source of nutrition, then which term best applies to the chytrids?

12.  Two products, QI and VH, emerge from a joint process. Product QI has been allocated $9,600 of the total joint costs of $12,000. A total of 9,000 units of product QI are produced from the joint process. Product QI can be sold at the split-off point for $13 per unit, or it can be processed further for an additional total cost of $54,000 and then sold for $18 per unit. If product QI is processed further and sold, what would be the financial advantage (disadvantage) for the company compared with sale in its unprocessed form directly after the split-off point?

Please use the Heparin Protocol to answer the questions. WEIGHT ADJUSTED HEPARIN PROTOCOLLab Orders:  STAT: PT, INR, PTT, CBC  STAT: PTT 6 hours after any Heparin BOLUS or rate adjustment.  PTT every 6 hours until two (2) consecutive PTTs are therapeutic (46 to 70). Then change PTT to every 24 hours.  Stop Heparin infusion if platelet count is less than 100,000 or platelet count drops by 50% pre-Heparin level, and notify healthcare provider.   STEPS IN CALCULATING HEPARIN DOSAGE (INITIAL DOSAGE)  Change weight in pounds to kilograms.  Calculate IV Bolus Heparin at 80 units/kg (80 units per kg).   On hand: Heparin 5000 units/1 ml   Calculate IV Heparin continuous infusion at 18 units/kg/hr (18 units per kg per hr).   On hand: Heparin continuous infusion 25,000 units in 250 ml D5W.  Adjust Heparin infusion rate based on the sliding scale below (after the initial dosing and based upon subsequent PTTs):       PTT   UNITS OF HEPARIN      90    STOP Heparin for 1 hour, Then reduce Heparin infusion by 3 units/kg/hr.      The physician orders the weight-based Heparin protocol for a newly admitted patient in Atrial Fibrillation. The patient weighs {x} pounds. The nurse will administer a Heparin bolus of _________ ml. Record your answer using 1 decimal place(s). Enter only a number in the blank.

From MP4 process synchronization project, pipe() system call was introduced to achieve desired execution ordering of parent and child processes. Using pipe system call, implement a C program that (1) creates a child process using fork() system call, and (2) lets the child process print the process id of the parent process. It is important to make child process print the parent process id. Otherwise, there will be no credits. #include #include #include #include #include int main(void) { /* Write your code below that creates a child process and lets the child process to print the process id of the parent process. Note that getpid() is the system call which you can obtain the process id of the running process */

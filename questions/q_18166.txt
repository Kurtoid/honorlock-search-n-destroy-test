Given two processors P1 and P2, the 5 stages of each processor have the following latencies:      Decode Execute Memory Writeback   P1 300 ps 400 ps 350 ps 500 ps 100 ps   P2 200 ps 150 ps 120 ps 190 ps 140 ps    Assume that when pipelining, each pipeline stage costs 20 ps extra for the registers between pipeline stages.  Answer the following  questions using the table above. For a pipelined architecture what is the clock cycle time (in ps) (a) of processor P1: [a] (b) and of processor P2:  [b]   What is the latency (in ps) of an instruction (c) for processor P1: [c] (d) and for processor P2: [d]   What is the (ideal) throughput (you may write this as a ratio) (e) for processor P1: [e] (f) for processor P2:  [f]   If you could split one of the pipeline stages into 2 equal halves, (g) which stage should you choose for processor P1: [g] (h) What is the new cycle time for processor P1:  [h] (i) What is the new latency for processor P1: [i] (j) What is the new (ideal) throughput for processor P1: [j]   (k) which stage should you choose for processor P2: [k] (l) What is the new cycle time for processor P2:  [l] (m) What is the new latency for processor P2: [m] (n) What is the new (ideal) throughput for processor P2: [n]

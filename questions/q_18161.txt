Describe the history of China throughout the 19th century.  I'm looking for the timeline of specific events as well as the actions of specific leaders.  China started off the century the most powerful country in the world, but finished it in tatters.  Why was such a powerful country not able to hold back the growing European powers?  What types of reforms did they pursue, and why didn't those reforms succeed?  There's a lot of ground to cover here.
A farmer making grape juice fills a glass bottle to the brim and caps it tightly. The juice expands more than the glass when it warms up, in such a way that the volume increases by 0.3% (that is, DV/V0=3x10-3) relative to the space available. Calculate the force exerted by the juice per square centimeter if its bulk modulus is 1.8x109N/m2, assuming the bottle does not break. Show in detail how you get to the solution of the problem.
To answer questions 11, 12, and 13 below consider the following situation: The Happyville General Hospital opened a new wing for patients with serious heart conditions.  The Program in the new wing includes more stringent utilization review procedures and the establishment of a cheerful, home-like environment.  Since there are a limited number of beds in the new wing, not every eligible patient can be assigned to this area.  Thus, the hospital has been randomly assigning eligible patients to the new wing program and to the regular wings.  In other words, this is a classical randomized experiment. The hospital, as well as the State Dept. of Health that authorized the experiment, are interested in the program's impact on outcome areas/indicators such as length of stay in the hospital measured in days(LOS) and the number of days spent in readmission for treatment in the hospital(READMYS).  The hope is that the new program will reduce length of stay without increasing readmission (readmission is often a sign that the treatment initially provided was not effective and/or that the patient may have been prematurely discharged).Preliminary data on   20 patients randomly assigned to the new wing program and on 20 patients randomly assigned to the regular wings have been compiled in a data base.     Using SPSS with this data base, the analyst obtained the following multiple regression equations that can be used to assess the impact of the new wing program to date(essentially, this is a more rigorous way than crosstabs or tables to analyze data from a randomized experiment):                   LOS= 1.88 - 3.60 EXPTL + 2.02 SEVERITY + .843 OVR65                                                    (p=.02)                 (p=.00)                  (p=.61)                      R-SQUARE= .61              READMYS= -.67 -.52 EXPTL + .37 SEVERITY +.07 OVR65                                (p=.16)           (p=.00)                 (p=.87)                        R-SQUARE= .46 LOS= Patient Length of Stay in Days during Initial Admission EXPTL = 1 if patient assigned to the experimental treatment group in the new wing               0 if patient assigned to the control group READYMS= Number of Days Spent in Readmission for Treatment (is 0 if to date not readmitted) SEVERITY= a Scale for assessing the extent of initial problem severity of these heart condition patients. It ranges from 0 (least severe) to 10 (most severe). OVR65= 1 if patient as of initial admission was 65 years of age or older                0 if patient as of initial admission was less than 65 years of age

QUESTION #1            Bea Kinney is a 65 year-old mother of five adult children.  She is also a Pilates' instructor who takes pride in her appearance.  Bea has a lot of sagging skin on her tummy caused by sudden weight gain and loss from five pregnancies. Bea decided that she would finally do something about her unsightly pouch of skin.  She went to a plastic surgeon, Dr. Ryno Plasti, to investigate a tummy tuck. Dr. Plasti explained the procedure and further explained that the tummy tuck would be performed under a general anesthetic which has a 1% risk of death, paralysis, or serious injury, including brain damage.    The procedure went smoothly and was performed with all reasonable care.                 A panniculectomy (skin removal surgery) and tummy tuck (abdonimoplasty) are both procedures to remove excess lower belly skin.  The goal of panniculectomy is to remove hanging skin.  A tummy tuck provides contouring effects to enhance muscles and waistline.  A tummy tuck is considered plastic surgery and is not covered by health insurance or Medicare.  The out-of-pocket cost is about $6,500.  A panniculectomy costs from $8,000 to $15,000 but the procedure is covered by health insurance and Medicare (minus a $500 deductible).  Bea is on Medicare.  The panniculectomy would have been an appropriate procedure for Bea because her muscles were in great shape; she just had saggy belly skin.  Bea would have opted for the panniculectomy had she known that it was covered by Medicare. Most doctors consider the selection of the correct procedure a medical decision and do not discuss the two different procedures with their patients.  Did Dr. Ryno Plasti have a duty to disclose to Bea Kinney about the differences in the two procedures including the differences in out-of-pocket costs of the two procedures?

*Name the formed element in the center of the view.
For the given method header, make a copy of the array passed in that squares(i.e. multiplies by itself) every other VALUE in the array, starting with the second element. You may assume the passed in array will not be null and contain at least 2 values.    For example, if the input array is:    4 5 -2 -3 9    Then the returned COPY of the array (not the original array) would be:     4 25 -2 9 9    Here is the method header: public int[] square(int[] input) (You do not have to include the method curly braces.)   Make sure to select the 'Preformatted' style from the dropdown so your code is formatted clearly.  DO NOT USE THE TAB KEY WHEN WRITING CODE AS YOU MAY ACCIDENTALLY SUBMIT YOUR EXAM. USE THE SPACE BAR INSTEAD.

QUESTION 2     The solubility of a solid in water is the maximum mass of the solid that can dissolve in 100 g of water at a given temperature. An aqueous solution containing this maximum mass can be described as a saturated solution. The graph (linked to the button below) shows the solubilities of three solids at different temperatures.   Right-click the button below to open the Periodic Table in a new tab.       2.1   (i) What is the relationship between solubility and temperature for solid A?   (1)         (ii) Which solid is the most soluble at 30degC?   (1)     2.2   Explain what you would observe if a saturated solution of solid A were cooled from 90degC to 20degC   (2)

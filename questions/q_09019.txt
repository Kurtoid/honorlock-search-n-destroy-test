Evaporative water loss in the leaves leads to high osmolarity.  This produces lower values for [ans5], which in turn keeps leaf Pstotal low enough to consistently draw xylem sap upward.  Phloem sap moves from areas called [ans6] which are actively photosynthetic to areas like the roots - called [ans7] - which are not photosynthetic.  Sugar within the phloem sap is associated with osmotic gradients that draw water from xylem-to-phloem or from phloem-to-xylem.  This water movement creates a sort of elevator effect in which the upward movement of xylem sap also helps to drive the downward movement of phloem sap.  Water moves osmotically from phloem-to-xylem near the [ans8] of the plant.

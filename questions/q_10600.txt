On a construction project, many failed inspections have been occurring. The positions of some electrical outlets and plumbing fixtures do not seem to comply with the code. Explain (in writing only) how you would use a Cause and Effect diagram to study the possible causes of this problem. List some of these possible causes, and their sub-causes. Use the following four (4) categories as headings - workers, materials, measurement, and methods. Place one or more possible causes under each heading. You do not have to draw the diagram, but explain the actions you would take based on the chart.

Use the picture, variables, and problem setup from here to answer this and the following three questions. The answer to part a is the answer to this question. The following parts are answered in questions 25, 26, and 27. An LC circuit with a period of oscillation of  = [period] ms has a capacitor of size  = [C] uF. At time  = 0, the energy in the inductor is  = [UL] mJ and the energy in the capacitor is  = [UC] mJ.  (7 pts) What is the maximum charge that capacitor can hold as this system oscillates? (7 pts, Q25) What is the inductance? (7 pts, Q26) What is the current in the inductor at time t = 0? (7 pts, Q27) What is the maximum current that the inductor can have as the system oscillates?  Enter the maximum charge that the capacitor can hold (part a) here in units of mC.

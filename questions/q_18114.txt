1.1.19   Choose appropriate phrases from the drop-down menu below to complete the explanation of shifts of an aggregate demand curve and movements along aggregate demand curves.   When the price level in the economy changes there will a [Choose1] the aggregate demand curve. If the price level increases, there will be a movement upwards and to the left on the aggregate demand curve. If there is a decrease in the price level, then there will be a movement downwards to the right. However, if factors other than the price level change then the whole aggregate demand curve will shift, either to the right or to the left. For example, if there is a reduction in income tax, then the aggregate demand curve will shift to the [Choose2]. If, however, the rate of income tax increases, then the demand curve will shift to the [Choose3].   (3)

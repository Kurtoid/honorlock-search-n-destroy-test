1) A 60g skater spins at 0.800 rev/ s with her arms extended. Her rotational inertia is 2.5 kgm2. Then she brings her arms closer to the body and reduces the rotational inertia to 0.35 kgm2, and spins faster. A) Convert 0.800 rev/s to radians per second. (5 points) B) What is the skater's initial angular momentum? (5 points) C) What is her angular velocity in radians per second after she pulls in her arms? (5 points) D) What is her initial rotational kinetic energy? (5 points)     2) An ultra-centrifuge accelerates from rest to 100,000 rpm in 2 minutes. Calculate its angular acceleration in radians/s2.

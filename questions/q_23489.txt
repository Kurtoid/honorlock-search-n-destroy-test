Find the two data sets. Each of the two sets has 4 records (n=4). Find the correct description.  Use (n-1) to compute the (co)variance (round to the nearest tenth or +1 decimal place).    Set A x1 x2 (x1-x1_bar) (x2-x2_bar) (x1-x1_bar)*(x2-x2_bar)   1 1 11      2 7 17      3 12 22      4 18 28       * In set A, the mean of x1 (=x1_bar) is 9.5 and the mean of x2 (=x2_bar) is 19.5.    Set B x1 x2 (x1-x1_bar) (x2-x2_bar) (x1-x1_bar)*(x2-x2_bar)   1 1 33      2 7 17      3 12 12      4 18 4       ** In set B, the mean of x1 (=x1_bar) is 9.5 and the mean of x2 (=x2_bar) is 16.5.

Identify the cells in the blood smear below.
While testing for contamination at a bottling plant, it was found that a small sample of juice contained 30 E. coli cells. That particular strain is known to have a generation time (doubling time) of 12 minutes. How many cells would there be if a second sample was taken one hour later?  To determine the answer, answer questions 1 - 3 below.   Note: The formula for calculating the number of cells after a certain amount of time has passed is as follows: Nf = Ni x 2n  What is the value of Ni? [N_zero] What is the value of n? [n] How many cells would there be at the end of the hour? [N]   (Use the Honorlock calculator if needed.)

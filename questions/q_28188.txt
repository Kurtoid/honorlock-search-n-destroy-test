The relevant incremental cash expenses are expected to include direct materials, direct labor, and factory overhead (excluding depreciation) totaling $80,000 per year. The firm uses straight-line depreciation with no residual value for all depreciable assets. Pique's combined marginal income tax rate is 40%.Management requires a minimum after-tax rate of return (i.e., discount rate) of 10% on all investments. Question 3.

Do not forget that all cash flows should be taken "after-tax".)

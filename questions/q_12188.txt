Growing up in the South, she was used to having lots of fried food at home, gravy on everything, and chips as a way to tide her over from one meal to the next. Now that Amanda was in her early twenties, she noticed that she was starting to gain weight. Just a few weeks ago, Betty got diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and her doctors told her that losing weight was an important part of getting healthy. Amanda decided to call her mom to discuss both their situations. She was starting to think that they both needed to start making better choices about what they ate and how much they exercised, and to prioritize living healthier.

Questions  What did Amanda and Betty want to change, and why is that hard to do? (3pts) What will doing it together do for Amanda and Betty as they both try to lose weight and get healthier?

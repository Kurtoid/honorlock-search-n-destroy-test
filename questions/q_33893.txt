Compute the drainage amount at the end of a rainfall event in the month of April considering the following information (show all your calculations/steps/units):  Use a 1 in 4 years return period rainfall event derived from the maximum three (3) days rainfall duration records for the month of April, shown in the table below,    The soil water content before the rainfall event was at 90% of that at field capacity (FC) in the first meter of soil depth (active root zone). At FC the volumetric water content in the soil is 0.33 m3 m-3. The rainfall intensity is considered to be less than the long term soil infiltration rate, The field (to be drained) is a corn field which during the corn off-season (when rainfall storms are expected) has no evapotranspiration. Besides computing the drainage amount also report the 3-day rainfall amount (mm) corresponding to the 4 year recurrence interval, and the associated rainfall probability of exceedance (in relation to the return period considered).

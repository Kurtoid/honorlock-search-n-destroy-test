SPSS is to be used to construct a multiple regression model for a data set with two independent variables (x1 and x2) and dependent variable y. Before analyzing the model, diagnostics were generated to check underlying assumptions. Use the SPSS output provided below to check the appropriate assumption.            The Durbin-Watson statistic can be used to check the assumption of [a1]. The range of the Durbin-Watson statistic is [a2], and any value [a3] is acceptable. In this case, the value of the Durbin-Watson statistic 2.432; therefore, the aforementioned assumption is [a4].

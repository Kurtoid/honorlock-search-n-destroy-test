Anna is a competitive runner. She wants to improve her performance and decides to keep track of data for six months to determine if the time of day or year she runs affects her performance. Her worksheet contains the following data: start and end time, total time, and distance. Anna wants to know the longest total time she has run. By looking at the total time values, she finds the longest total time to be 54 minutes. Instead of manually entering that value in a cell below the total time data, Anna decides to use the MAX function to determine the longest total time. Why did Anna prefer to use the MAX function?

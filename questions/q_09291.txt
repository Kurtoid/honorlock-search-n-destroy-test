Problem 2 You are asked to recommend a specific way a sender  can send a large file  to a receiver  with his secret-public key pair, without interaction. I.e., you cannot use interactive key exchange protocols. The receiver's public key is assumed to be authentic. The sender doesn't have her own key pair. In addition to the strongest security you are asked to pay attention to efficiency of your suggested scheme. 1) Describe what  does to send  and what  does to get . To do so, use the known schemes and their algorithms as building blocks. E.g., if you use AES-CBC$ as a building block, do not define it, just refer to its algorithms. 2) Specify what security level your scheme provide, under which assumptions, and why. You can refer to the known notions of security and the results we studied in class. It is OK to rely on the random oracle model if needed.

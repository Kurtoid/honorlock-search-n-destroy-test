A function is described below.  Use calculus reasoning and show your work as you locate and report all local maxima and minima and all inflection points. Finally, sketch the graph of a function which satisfies all of the given conditions. Label the maxima, minima, and inflection points on your graph. Note: Since you do not know the function,  f  ,  be sure to identify the LOCATIONS ( x - values ) of all features of the graph. (a)  The function  f  is continuous on the whole real line. (b)  f (-4 ) = 5,   f (0) = 2,   and   f (3) = -2    (c)   f ' (-4) = 0,   f ' (0) = 0,   and   f ' (3) = 0. (d)     (e)  The first derivative of f  is positive on

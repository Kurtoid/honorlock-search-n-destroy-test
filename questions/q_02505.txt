Caution : Inclusion of unnecessary or unrelated logic or code segment will result in loss of points. Do not use any global variables.  Must implement the specific requirements outlined below. Apart from that, no restriction. State all assumption Assume a customer data file (customer.dat) with fixed length record was created with x number of records using another C program. The first  4 bytes of the data file contains the total number of records  (integer value) in the file. The rest of the file will contain the records themselves.  Here is the byte layout of the data file.  Count : 4 bytesRecord 1 : 30 bytesRecord 2 : 30 bytesRecord 3 : 30 bytes Record x : 30 bytes Assume the data file will not contain more than 100 records. All data and records are valid and written using fwrite operations. The record layout is as followsFirstName : 25 bytes (char data type)Gender : 1 byte (char data type) Age : 4 bytes (int data type) Write a C program that will complete the following operations without any user intervention. a) use of a function to read customer data (records) from the data file and populate the records into variables that will be used in parts b, c, and d  of the program. Do not include any other logic except for reading the file and populating variables.  b) find the average of the ages of all the customer recordsc) generate output to the displayd) generate output to the output file, customer.txt (fresh output every time this program is executed) Sample output (Header, Record detail, Average) to be displayed to the screen and output file. Name Gender Age1. James M 302. Jane F 20 Average Age : 25.0 Do not worry about the spacing of each field or lines.  The sample above only shows 2 record, assuming there are only two records in the data file. Your output should be based on the records read from the date file and not just the 2 records.

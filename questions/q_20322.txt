The path between points B and C forms part of a circle that is centered at point O and has a radius R = [R] m. Point C corresponds to the lowest point of the circle. (When the skier jumps from the ramp, the skier's initial velocity will be horizontal.) If the skier's speed at point C is [v] m/s, calculate the normal force on the skier at point C (at the instant before leaving the ramp).

What are the assumptions required to obtain a well behaved indifference curve? Explain each with a sentence.
Larry Landlord is upset that Tracey Tenant is smoking in single family home that he rented to them.  He specifically had a non-smoking clause in the lease.  He pointed it out to Tracey Tenant at the time of signing the lease.  Ironically, he pointed it out while he was smoking a cigarette with Tracey Tenant (Larry loves to smoke).  Larry explained to Tracey that he prohibited smoking in the rental unit for insurance reasons and not because it bothered him.  What Notice of Termination can Larry Landlord use?

Skill B2.  (This question based on a decision described by John Gerdes.)  John is selecting a servo for a flapping wing UAV and is concerned with three attributes (torque, speed, and mass).  Attribute values for the servo alternatives (Gerdes, 2018).

If swing weighting will be used to determine the weights on these attributes, which of the following hypothetical alternatives are in the set of those that should be evaluated to determine the weights of the utility function?

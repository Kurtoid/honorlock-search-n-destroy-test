Is the bolded statement TRUE or FALSE? Changes in bond enthalpy are calculated by taking the difference between the enthalpy of the bonds broken and the enthalpy of the bonds formed (dH = Hbonds broken - Hbonds formed).  Given this changes in bond enthalpy: 16. are always negative for a reaction in which more bonds are formed than broken. 17. when positive, indicate the formation of bonds. 18. when negative, will destabilize a system (such as a protein), and are therefore thermodynamically unfavorable. 19. are always positive for an endergonic process. 20. would be negative if hydrogen bonds were being broken in order to form covalent bonds.

Problem 1 (30 points): Given: Water at 70degF (density r = 62.3 lbm/ft3, dynamic viscosity m = 6.556 x 10-4 lbm/ft[?]s) flows through the system below at a rate of 0.02 ft3/s. The horizontal pipeline is 0.75 in commercial steel pipe with total length of 200 ft. The vertical pipeline is 2 in cast iron pipe with length of 8 ft. The pump is rated at 82% efficiency. Reservoir volumes are large. Required: (30 pts.) Calculate the power that must be supplied to the pump in lbf*ft/s.                      Problem 2 (20 points): Given: Water in a pipe flows through a reducing elbow that deflects water at a 45 degree angle from the horizontal, discharging a steady flow of 40 kg/s of water to the atmosphere. The diameters of the horizontal pipe and outlet are 12 cm and 5 cm, respectively. The elevation difference between the centers of the horizontal pipe and deflected pipe outlet is 50 cm. Mass of the elbow and water is 70 kg. Flow through the pipe is turbulent and you may assume a momentum flux correction factor of 1.03. You may otherwise neglect frictional effects.      Required:  (3 pts.) Draw a free-body diagram of the elbow, indicating all forces and momentum. (15 pts.) Determine the magnitude of anchoring force needed to hold the elbow in place, in kN. (2 pts.) Compute the line of action of anchoring force in degrees relative to horizontal Bonus (2 points): Assuming the elbow is at sea level, compute the absolute pressure of water entering the elbow control volume, in units of atm.      Problem 3 (30 points): Given: For the following steady 2D flow, in which the k component is aligned with Earth's gravitational field:    Required:  (5 pts.) Prove that the flow is incompressible. (5 pts.) Identify any stagnation points within the flow field. (5 pts.) Prove that the flow is irrotational. (5 pts.) Derive an expression for acceleration as a function of x and y. (10 pts.) Derive an expression for pressure as a function of x and y.      Problem 4 (20 points): Given: The magnitude of drag force (F) a flow enacts on an object submerged within the flow is a function of fluid density (

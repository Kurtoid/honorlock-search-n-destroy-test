TEST EEL 5490/4495-6   Spring 2021     1 (25%). Derive the far field approximation (equation without integrals) for azimuthal magnetic field intensity. Start from the radiation field component of exact equation for magnetic field and use the transmission line (TL) model. Assume that lightning channel is straight and vertical, return-stroke speed is constant, and ground is perfectly conducting. Show and explain all steps. Discuss limits of validity of the derived equation.             2 (25%). Compare transmission-line-type (lumped-source) and traveling-current-source-type (distributed-source) return stroke models in terms of their (a) concepts (b) ability to predict adequately electric fields at different distances from the lightning channel. Which model(s) would you prefer for computing lightning electric fields at a distance of 50 m from the lightning channel?             3 (50%). Design a passive electric field measuring system to detect electric fields produced by first return strokes in natural negative lightning at a distance of about 200 km. The recording device has an input resistance of 1 Megaohm and an input capacitance of 15 pF. The recorder is connected to the electric field sensor and associated electronics via a short coaxial cable and has an input-voltage setting of -0.1 V to +0.1 V. [5% bonus for answering the following question: How would the performance characteristics of the system change if the input resistance of the recorder were 10 kiloohm?]

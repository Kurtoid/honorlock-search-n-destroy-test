You are exhibiting at a national show at which 5/8ths of the attendees tend to visit a majority of the booths.  Opening at 8 am daily, and closing at 6:30 pm, the shows runs Monday through Friday.  Roughly 5,000 people will attend the show, of which 2,500 are in your target market (each of whom will visit your booth).  Your booth staff will average 5 minutes speaking with each contact.  You will need an additional 125 square feet for demonstration space, private places, etc.  A total of 150 new sales will be made as a direct result of the qualified sales leads generated by the show.  You may assume that your attraction and contact efficiencies are equal, and that all industry and product types averages apply.  Round up to the nearest square foot.     Your formula for minimum booth size is: (Attendance * Product Interest % * A.I.F. * 50) / (Show Hours * Salesperson Rate)   How many additional sales calls would been necessary to close the new sales?

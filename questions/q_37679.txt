Bonus (6 points.) A 60.0 g piece of metal was heated in boiling water to 100.0 oC   and then dropped into water (cwater = 4.184 J/g*oC) in an insulated beaker.  There are 55.0 mL of water (density = 1.00g/mL) in the beaker, and its temperature before the metal was dropped in was 24.0 oC. The final temperature of the metal and water is 27.2 oC. What is the specific heat of the metal? Assume that no heat transfers through the walls of the beaker or to the atmosphere. Show your work.

Using the following lines of code, build a function called product_sum() which accepts two vectors of int values (named 'x' and 'y') as arguments, multiplies each element of 'x' with every element of 'y', sums the products, and collects the sums into a new vector, which is finally returned by the function. For example, if the two vectors were ... vector x = {1, 2, 3};vector y = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; ... then the resulting vector from product_sum() would contain the following elements: {15, 30, 45} Complete the function by selecting the appropriate lines of code: [x3] product_sum(vector& x, vector& y) {     vector results;     int product;    int total;    for (int i = 0; i < [x6]; ++i) {        [x2]        for (int j = 0; j < [x8]; ++j) {            [x1]            [x5]        }        [x4]    }    return [x7];} (NOTE: Not all of the lines of code provided in the drop-down lists will be used in this function!)

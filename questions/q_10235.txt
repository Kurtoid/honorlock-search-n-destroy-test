Methyl bromide (CH3Br) will react with potassium hydroxide to give the corresponding alcohol methanol (CH3OH) and potassium bromide salt.  The kinetics for the reaction are known to be first order with respect to CH3Br.  Data for an initial rates kinetic experiment are below.  The density of the 18% by wt. solution of KOH (MW 56.1g/mol) is 1.15 g/mL.   What is the rate constant for the reaction?     CH3Br + KOH --> CH3OH + KBr     Trial   Vol 18% KOH (mL)   Vol final (mL)   initial [CH3Br] (M)   Initial Rate      A   0.5   10   0.0045   -2.64x10-3     B   1.0   10   0.0045   -1.06x10-2

The analytics major has some very important objectives embedded in it. One of the most important is for you to learn the technical aspects of building predictive models. In addition to that, this class had several objectives, and one of those was to prepare you to go out into the world with the ability to communicate the quantitative results of those models.  We looked at a number of myths regarding the communication side of that process.  Most analytics professionals are gifted with the ability to make sense out of numbers and patterns in the numbers.  As a result, we might have more of an introverted personality.  We talked about a number of myths associated with public speaking.  Which of these myths do you associate with the most and what do you plan to do to overcome it?
Gigondas Incorporated had the following information:       Activity Driver    Unit Variable Cost     Level of Activity Driver     Units sold  $         20      --    Setups   1,000      40    Engineering hours      60   1,000            Other data:       Total fixed costs (traditional)  $100,000      Total fixed costs (ABC)   $  50,000      Unit selling price       $         40        Required:      a. Calculate the break-even point in units using the traditional approach to CVP analysis.   b. Calculate the break-even point in units using the activity-based costing approach to CVP analysis.   c. Calculate the number of units using the activity-based costing approach, that must be sold to earn a before-tax profit of $40,000.   d. Suppose Gilbert could reduce setup costs by $300 per setup and could reduce the number of engineering hours needed to 900. How many units must be sold to break even in this case?

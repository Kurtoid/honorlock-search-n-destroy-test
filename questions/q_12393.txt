A spring/block system is kept in a vertical orientation as shown in the figure.  At the beginning, the spring is squeezed and the system is at rest. When the system is released the block start moving up with an acceleration. Take d = 4.60 cm, m = 1.70 kg and k = 1050 N/m. Take gravitational and spring potential energy as zero for y = 0. Answer the following questions. A) Find the speed of the block when the spring has returned to its equilibrium position. B) Find the maximum height (in m) the block reaches from y=0 position on the scale. C) Determine the value of y (in cm) for which the kinetic energy of the system is a maximum.

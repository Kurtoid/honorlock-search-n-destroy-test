Read the following full selection and answer the question that follows. WEB 2.01 Today's broadband Internet infrastructure has greatly expanded the services available to users. These new capabilities have formed the basis for new business models. Digital content and digital communications are the two areas where innovation is most rapid. Web 2.0 applications and services are "social" in nature because they support communication among individuals within groups or social networks.Online Social Networks2 If there is a "killer app" on the Internet, it is social networks. Online social networks have developed very large worldwide audiences and form the basis for new advertising platforms and for social e-commerce. Online social networks are services that support communication within networks of friends, colleagues, and entire professions. The largest social networks are Facebook (1 billion worldwide), LinkedIn (175 million worldwide), Twitter (more than 140 million active users worldwide), and Pinterest (more than 100 million). These networks rely on user-generated content (messages, photos, and videos) and emphasize sharing of content.Blogs3 A blog (originally called a weblog) is a personal Web page that typically contains a series of chronological entries (newest to oldest) by its author, and links to related Web pages. The blog may include a blogroll (a collection of links to other blogs) and trackbacks (a list of entries in other blogs that refer to a post on the first blog). Most blogs allow readers to post comments on the blog entries as well. No one knows how many of these blogs are kept up to date or are just yesterday's news.Really Simple Syndication (RSS)4 The rise of blogs is correlated with a distribution mechanism for news and information from Web sites that regularly update their content. Really Simple Syndication (RSS) allows users to have digital content, including text, articles, blogs, and podcast audio files, automatically sent to their computers over the Internet. An RSS aggregator software application that you install on your computer gathers material from the Web sites and blogs that you tell it to scan and brings new information from those sites to you.Internet Telephony5 If the telephone system were to be built from scratch today, it would be an Internet-based network. This system would be less expensive and more efficient than the alternative existing system, which involves a mix of circuit-switched legs with a digital backbone. Likewise, if cable television systems were built from scratch today, they most likely would use Internet technologies for the same reasons.Intelligent Personal Assistants6 The idea of having a conversation with a computer, having it understand you, and be able to carry out tasks according to your direction, has long been a part of science fiction, from the 1968 Hollywood movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, to an old Apple promotional video depicting a professor using his personal digital assistant to organize his life, gather data, and place orders at restaurants. That was all fantasy. But Apple's Siri, billed as an intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator and released in October 2011 for the iPhone 4S, has many of the capabilities of the computer assistants found in fiction. Siri has a natural language, conversational interface, situational awareness, and is capable of carrying out many tasks based on verbal commands by delegating requests to a variety of different Web services. For instance, you can ask Siri to find a restaurant nearby that serves Italian food, and you will receive several choices.7 In July, 2012, Google released its version of an intelligent assistant for Android-based smartphones, which it calls Google Now. Google Now is part of the Google Search application. While Google Now has many of the capabilities of Apple's Siri, it attempts to go further by predicting what users may need based on situational awareness, including physical location, time of day, previous location history, calendar, and expressed interests based on previous activity. For instance, if you often search for a particular musician or style of music, Google Now might provide recommendations for similar music. If it knows that you go to a health club every other day, Google Now will remind you not to schedule events during these periods.--Adapted from Laudon and Traver, E-commerce: Business. Technology.

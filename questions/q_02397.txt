Tom paid monthly rent of $1200 from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019.  On January 5, 2020, the landlord met with Tom and let him know that he would have to increase the rent.  The landlord was decent and told Tom that he knew Tom was having money problems and asked Tom how much he could afford.  Tom agreed that the market rent for his unit was closer to $1900 than $1200 and appreciated that the Landlord was being fair.  Tom told the landlord he could pay $1450 a month without a problem.  The landlord agreed.  Tom paid $1450 a month from February 1, 2020 to April 2021 (15 months).  In April 2021 Tom heard about Rent Increase Guidelines and that the Ontario government decided every year how much the rent could be raised.  He learned that the guideline in 2020 was 2.2%.    2.2% of $1200 is $26.40 per month.  Tom paid an increase of $250.00 per month instead of $26.40.   Tom feels ripped off.  What is the lawful rent and how much can Tom get back.  Today's date, for the purposes of this question is April 30, 2021. [this is the highest value question on this exam]

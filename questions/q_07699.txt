In June 2018, there is currently a backorder of 100 cabinets. The demand for July through December of 2018 is shown in the table below. The regular-time production cost is $590 per cabinet, the overtime production cost is $885 per cabinet, the cost of holding a cabinet in inventory is $84 per cabinet, and the cost of backordering a cabinet is $95 per cabinet. The number of cabinets in inventory may never decrease by more than 10% from one month to the next, and the number of cabinets in inventory at the end of December must be 0. The number of backordered cabinets may never increase by more than 10% from one month to the next, and the number of backordered cabinets at the end of December must be 0. Regular-time production must be the same in each of the six months of the planning horizon and overtime production in a given month is limited to no more than 40% of the regular time production level. Build a linear programming model for the aggregate plan that will minimize the sum of backorder costs + inventory costs + regular-time production costs + overtime production costs for the six-month planning period.

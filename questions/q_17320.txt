Using PICOT framework, analyze the abstract provided below and formulate the research question.  *Note: 'T' is optional; but 'PICO' parts are necessary.    **This is an example of an answer for this type of question: Population: Bariatric adolescents considering or undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Intervention: The nurse's role as a primary member of the multidisciplinary team regarding perioperative care of the bariatric adolescent patient. Comparison: The nurse's role as a secondary member of the multidisciplinary team without any specialized training and is only involved in perioperative care of the bariatric adolescent patient. Outcome: When the nurse is involved as one of the primary members in the multidisciplinary team approach, the bariatric adolescent patient has better continuity of care. Time: perioperative including the 6 weeks post-recovery.

Objective:  To determine the relationship between state Medicaid expansion and emergency access to acute care hospitals in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants:  This cross-sectional study linked hospital-level data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from 2007 to 2017 to US Census data for all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Geospatial analyses and difference-in-differences regression models were used to compare temporal changes in the size of the population without 30-minute access to acute care hospitals between 32 states that expanded Medicaid with the population without access in 19 that did not, before and after expansion. Analyses focused on the total population and those with low incomes; secondary analyses examined emergency access to safety-net hospitals. Exposures:  State-level Medicaid expansion. Main Outcomes and Measures:  Population without emergency access to an acute care hospital, defined as living outside a 30-minute drive of any hospital. Results:  States that did not expand Medicaid experienced an increase in the population without access to hospitals overall (without expansion: 6.76% to 6.79% [0.03%]; vs with expansion: 5.65% to 5.35% [-0.30%]; difference-in-differences, 0.33%; 95% CI, 0.33%-0.34%; P

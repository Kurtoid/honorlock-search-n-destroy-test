Define a new type called Rectangle that can be used for storing all the information necessary to be able to draw a rectangle at a particular x, y location of a particular width and height (all whole numbers). The x, y refer to the position of the upper left corner of the rectangle. Assume that x is 0 at the top and grows as it goes down. Assume that y is 0 on the left and grows as as it goes right. The user should be able to construct a Rectangle located at an x of 10, a y of 17, 100 wide and 50 tall by writing: Rectangle rect = {10, 17, 100, 50}. Write a function called contains that takes two pointers to Rectangles as parameters and returns true if the second rectangle is entirely contained inside the first and false otherwise. You can assume both passed in Rectangles will be valid. That means they will have x, y coordinates of 0 or greater and widths and heights of 0 or greater. Rectangle big = {10, 25, 100, 100}; Rectangle small = {30, 25, 50, 10}; bool fits = contains(&big, &small);  After the above call fits would store true because the small's left side starts after big's (30 vs 10), small's right side ends before big's (80 vs 110), small's top starts the same place as big's (25 vs 25) and small's bottom edge ends before big's (35 vs 125) Rectangle bigish {10, 25, 50, 50}; Rectangle smallish {30, 25, 50, 10}; bool fits2 = contains(&bigish, &smallish);  After the above call fits2 would store false because the left side of bigish occurs before the left side of smallish but the right side of bigish also occurs before the right side of smallish.

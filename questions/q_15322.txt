Skeletal and cardiac muscle are both types of striated muscle. You have been given one type of each sample, but the identifying labels have come off. You know that these muscles have some similarities and some differences in terms of their rate of depolarization, rate of repolarization, and length of action potential.   Answer the following questions as they relate to the muscle depicted in sample B. 1. Identify the muscle type. 2. Are there special types of calcium channels associated with this muscle type? If so, identify the calcium channels. 3. Calcium channels are responsible for distinct refractory periods. What is the name of the refractory period for this muscle type?
True or False? Explain. A.  If P is a poset that has 29 elements, then P must contain a chain of five elements or an antichain of eight elements. B. Let p be a permutation that avoids 1243. Then the permutation p' obtained from p by removing all the left-to-right minima is 132-avoiding.  C.  There are as many 231-avoiding permutations of length n with k descents as there are 231-avoiding permutations of length n with $n-1-k$ descents.

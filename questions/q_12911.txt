Rivera-Ordaz et al. studied proline uptake in the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, the causative agent of type B gastritis and peptic ulcers (Rivera-Ordaz, A.; Bracher, S.; Sarrach, S.; Li, Z.; Shi, L.; Quick, M.; Hilger, D.; Haas, R.; Jung, H. PLoS ONE 2013, 8, e83576).  To determine whether the H. pylori putP gene encoded a proline transporter, H. pylori cells were incubated in the presence of radioactive 14C L-Pro and the uptake of radioactivity was monitored over time.  The data are shown below.  Open circles = wild-type H. pylori, closed squares and open triangles = H. pylori mutants lacking the putP gene (disregard the open diamonds for this problem).  Note that the closed square and open triangle symbols lie nearly on top of one another.  Choose the answer with the correct interpretation of the data.

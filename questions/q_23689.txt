A Pascal program can declare two integer variables a and b with the following syntax:  var a, b : int This declaration might be described with the following grammar:   --> var  :   --> , ID | ID  --> int | float  where,  derives a comma separated list of variable names and  derives a valid Pascal type (int or float in the above grammar)  Write an attribute grammar that assigns the data type to each of the declared variables in the declaration statement, Define the attributes, the propagation rules and also identify if it is a synthetic attribute or inherited attribute - give all the details and explain properly how the attribute evaluation takes place. In a derivation such as  -->  attribute propagation should be shown as follows: { .attribute1 = .attribute2} which shows that  attribute2 of non-terminal is assigned  to the attribute1 of . This is just an illustration for the format in which you are supposed to write the answer.  Using the example declaration for a and b above, show the pertinent derivations and how the attributes are propagated and how type int is eventually attached to the declared variables a and b.  At each step, comment whether it was a synthesized attribute propagation or inherited attribute propagation.

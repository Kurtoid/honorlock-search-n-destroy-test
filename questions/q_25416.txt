Three boxes with mass m1 = 3m0,  m2 = m0, and m3 = m0 are on a horizontal frictionless surface.  The first box has initial velocity  to the right while the other boxes are initially at rest.  The first box collides with the second in a totally inelastic collision.  The two boxes then collide with the third in an elastic collision.  Find the final velocities of boxes (m1 + m2) now stuck together, and of box m3 after the second collision. (Symbolic solution.)

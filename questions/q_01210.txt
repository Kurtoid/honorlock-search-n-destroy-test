Scenario 2.1 Use the following to answer the questions.   Southwest Airlines has a history of being able to retain its employees due to the atmosphere and culture of the company. Employees have been known to dress up in costume on an airplane, engage in "games" with the passengers, and generally provide a fun atmosphere for traveling.

Southwest keeps its costs low through several methods, one being that they do not serve meals on flights, or provide pre-boarding passes. The typical flight is two hours or less and occurs between several selected cities rather than flying to practically anywhere in the country. Southwest is known for its low fares, its dependability, and its on-time flights.  Refer to Scenario 2.1.

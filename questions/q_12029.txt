Please consider the typical multi-clock-cycle datapath we have seen in lecture (note that its modification slightly--the ALU input B select mux has an input to select a constant value sent in by the datapath controller) as the following figure. As a computer architecture designed, your manager requests you to build an ISA that has a new instruction, CALL target, which has the following effect: MEM [r7] = PC + 4 r7 = r7 - 8 PC = target (1). Show the changes you need to make to the datapath design (add muxes, flip-flops, wires, etc.) to support the CALL instruction. Note, you can assume that there are muxes on the register file read/write inputs that allow the datapath control logic to specify a constant register number from the control logic (not pictured). Please specify how you change the datapath by re-wiring lines or cutting lines, adding on components, etc. For instance, you can point out "link P to R" in the datapath, or you can point out "cut a wire between L and M and place a MUX", etc. (2). Please describe and explain what happens cycle by cycle in your modified datapath to execute the CALL instruction (Note that you need to describe correctly so as to earn the marks).

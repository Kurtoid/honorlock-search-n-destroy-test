Avidin is a protein found in the eggs of birds that binds biotin with high affinity and is a strong inhibitor of biotin-requiring enzymes (recall that biotin is a necessary coenzyme for CO2 transfers). You perform an experiment using liver cells that are capable of gluconeogenesis growing in culture.  You add each of the following (answers A, B, C, D, or E) as potential substrates. Assume each is readily transported into the cell and/or mitochondria. You measure the amount of glucose synthesized and record in your lab book that all these substrates will support glucose synthesis.

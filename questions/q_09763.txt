I have read the following JSCC policy: In their academic activities, students are expected to maintain high standards of honesty and integrity. Academic dishonesty is prohibited. Such conduct includes, but is not limited to:  an attempt by one or more students to use unauthorized information in the taking of an exam, to submit as one's own work, themes, reports, drawings, laboratory notes, computer programs, or other products prepared by another person, or to knowingly assist another student in obtaining or using unauthorized materials. Plagiarism, cheating, and other forms of academic dishonesty are prohibited.  Students guilty of academic misconduct, either directly or indirectly through participation or assistance, are subject to disciplinary action through the regular procedures of the student's home institution. In addition to other possible disciplinary sanctions that may be imposed, the instructor has the authority to assign an "F" or zero for an activity or to assign an "F" for the course.
This is a practice to make sure I know how to use the HonorLock system for my exams.

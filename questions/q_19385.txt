Section 1. The Four Quadrant Model (4QM). Please answer Question 1 to Question 3 In the problem, you are asked to explain the relationships depicted in the Four Quadrant Model (4QM) and predict changes in rents, prices, stock of space, and construction due to the shock using the model. It would be helpful for you to draw the 4QM before and after the shock to answer the questions. But you do not need to submit the drawings.   1.  [8 points] Explain the relationship between the variables in each of the four quadrants: (i) What doesthe relationship in the quadrant stand for? (ii) How do variables depend on each other according to this relationship?  Quadrant I Quadrant II Quadrant III Quadrant IV    2. [4 points] Consider a decrease in employment. Will this decrease in employment affect any of the relationships depicted in the quadrants? If yes, explain how.   3. [12 points] How does the equilibrium change due to this decrease in employment? To answer the questions below, it is helpful to draw the old and new equilibrium before and after the decrease in employment. You do not need to submit the drawing with the midterm, only use it to answer the questions below. (a) Compare the rents, prices, stock of space, and construction in the new equilibrium relative to the old equilibrium. (b) Briefly explain the intuition behind any of the changes of the equilibrium rents [2 points], prices [2 points], levels of construction [2 points], and steady-state stock of space [2 points]. If there are no changes, explain it intuitively as well.

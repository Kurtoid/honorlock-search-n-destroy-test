For question 2, identify ONE (ONLY!) of the following quotations by **author AND work / title** (.5 points each for title of work and for author [if known; if no author for the work has been identified by experts, write "unknown" or "anonymous]).  Then discuss how and why the passage is thematically significant to the work as a whole (3 points).

Also **be certain to write next to your answer the letter (a or b) corresponding to the quote that you select (a prerequisite for receiving credit).**   a)  " 'On them I impose no limits of time or place.  I have given them an empire that will know no end. . . .  Then wars will be laid aside and the years of bitterness will be over. . . .   The dread Gates of War with their tight fastenings of steel will then be closed, and godless Strife will sit inside them . . . , hands shackled behind his back with a hundred bands of bronze.' " b)  "'Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves.  Its administration favours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy.  If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if to social standing advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way: if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition.  The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life.'" c)     " 'These roofs--look up--there is a dancing troupe / that never leaves. . . .    Flushed on the blood of men / their spirit grows and none can turn away    their revel breeding in the veins--the Furies! / They cling to the house for life.  They sing,    sing of the frenzy that began it all, . . . / showering curses /    on the man who tramples his brother's bed. /    . . . .Swear how well I know the ancient crimes / that live within this house.' "  (4 points for Question #2)   Your answers to Question 2: Quote identifying (specify a, b, or c): author: work: Explain how and why the passage is thematically significant to the work as a whole:

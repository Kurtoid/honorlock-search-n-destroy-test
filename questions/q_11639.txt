Case study #2 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is an enveloped retrovirus that has humans as its only reservoir. The spikes on HIV specifically bind to CD4 molecules of specific leukocytes and lymphocytes. After the viral genetic material is reverse transcribed by an enzyme known for its high error rate and poor proofreading, it is integrated into the host cell's chromosome. The virus then enters a period of latency. When activated, viral proteins are made using the same machinery and mechanisms as typical host cell proteins. Rapid viral replication results in the death of the host cell. A person with HIV has progressed to clinical AIDS when CD4 cells fall below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. (The CD4 count of a healthy adult/adolescent ranges from 500 cells/mm3 to 1,200 cells/mm3.)   AIDS results when HIV is actively and rapidly replicating in CD4 cells, resulting in the death of large numbers of CD4 cells. The loss of CD4 cells leads to people with AIDS being very susceptible to infection by ________________ that do not infect people with healthy immune systems.

Membrane osmometry (MO) is a useful technique for measuring molecular weight (MW) of polymers.   (i) Is it a relative or absolute method for the MW measurement?                      (2 pts) (ii) What specific molecular weight can OM measure?                                    (2 pts) (iii) A plot of p/(cRT) vs. concentration for a polymer sample in three different solvents (A, B, and C) is shown below. Which solvent is a poor, th, and good solvent for this hypothetical polymer? Moreover, calculate the molecular weight of this polymer.    (5 pts)                                                                                                             (iv) Write down one distinct advantage of capitalizing on membrane osmometry (MO) in measuring molecular weight over gel permeation chromatography (GPC).

In one kind of food chain, marsh grass and plants are the producers.  These plants pass energy along to one type of consumer, the butterfly.   Because the butterfly feeds directly on the plants, it is a first-level consumer.  The butterfly is eaten by a second-level consumer, the dragonfly.  The frog, snake, and hawk are third-level consumers.  The eat animals that ate other animals.  In another food chain, these third-level consumers may be second-level consumers.  For example, the hawk is second-level consumer when it eats a rabbit.  The rabbit feeds on plants, so it is a first-level consumer.      Food chains may be longer or shorter than this one.  Each chain leads to an animal, such as a hawk or a human that is not eaten by other animals.  But this is not the end of the food chain.  The wastes and remains of these top consumers are food for the decomposers.  Decayed bacteria and fungi are examples of decomposers.  They break down waste and dead organisms all along the food chain.  These broken down materials are returned to the soil.  Here they are recycled and used again.   14.

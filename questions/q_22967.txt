For example, Angiosperms and Gymnosperms are more closely related to each other than they are to the other 3 groups of plants. Therefore, they form a clade. Often clades are defined by a trait that the ancestor of that clade evolved and is now shared by its extant descendants (i.e. the members of the clade).

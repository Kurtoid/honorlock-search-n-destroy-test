Cold water (  c p  = 4180     J/kg [?] K ) leading to a shower enters a thin-walled double-pipe counter-flow heat exchanger at [Tci]oC at a rate of [mc] kg/s and is heated to [Tco]oC by hot water (  c p  = 4190     J/kg [?] K ) that enters at [Thi]oC at a rate of [mh] kg/s. If the overall heat transfer coefficient is [U]   W/m 2  [?] K , determine:  Draw a schematic of the heat exchanger. Plot the temperatures vs. position for the heat exchanger. Determine the rate of heat transfer of the heat exchanger. Find the heat transfer surface area of the heat exchanger in m2. Use the box below to answer this part of the problem.  Show all your work on the work upload (assumptions, schematics, analysis, etc.) document. Write down units in your equations. Solve symbolically and plug in numbers at the end.

Which of the following strategies seeks long term supplier relationships and economies of scale for the suppliers?
Intertidal rocks are normally dominated by algae communities. In an experiment on community stability, researchers removed an area of algae from the rocks and then measured how much of the community ended up composed of barnacles (Semibalanus). They controlled the area of algae originally removed. These results suggest that an alternative stable state in community structure arises if the area of algae removed exceeds_______m2

Did you show a 360 degree view of your room AND show your desktop during the room scan?  If not, do it NOW! Maximize the testing window!  You should not see anything on the computer except the test and testing materials.  Please take a moment, before you start the test, and show your webcam that both sides of each sheet of scratch paper are blank, even if you showed it during your environment video.  The formula sheet can be access by clicking the Instructions button.   Thank you!

In general, appraisers treat capital expenditures (CAPX) as a/an ________ expense.
The influenza virus attaches to host sialic acid molecules through the hemagglutinin envelope protein. This interaction is an essential step for Influenza virus to enter the host cells. The host sialic acid molecules are linked to the carbohydrate galactose on the surface of the host cell. The hemagglutinin of avian influenza virus strains binds preferentially to sialic acid in the a-2,3 linkage conformation. The hemagglutinin of human influenza virus strains binds preferentiallyto sialic acid in the a-2,6 linkage conformation. Which of the following would decrease the ID50 of the avian influenza virus for human cells?
Capillaries from least to most leaky would be;

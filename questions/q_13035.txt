An injury that damages the ventral root at spinal level S3 will affect axons of neurons that are located in which one of the following structures?
pH is an important factor in regulating breathing. Chemoreceptors detect pH changes in the blood and report them to the Pontine respiratory group. The Pontine group then sends signals to the diaphragm to change breathing rate. If pH becomes too high, breathing rate is reduced. If pH is too low, breathing is increased.The changes in breathing cause the abnormal pH to be corrected.  What is the control center in this example?
For this question on genetically modified organisms, please pick ONLY ONE of the two following questions to answer. I.e., you have a choice of which you would prefer to answer, so pick the one you're more comfortable with. Please do not answer them both as I will only grade the first (and hopefully only!) one you answer!   Option #1: Pick a type of organism (e.g., bacteria, plant, etc.) and describe steps that would be involved in making it a genetically modified organism.                                                                                     ---or--- Option #2: A friend tells you she thinks genetically modified organisms are harmful to the environment, too dangerous to use, and that she avoids all of them. How might you respond to her comments, and what factual information could you share that might help her at least understand them better and perhaps worry less?                                                                                      ---or---                   Option #3: For the pGLO bacterial transformation experiment, under the correct conditions, transformed E. coli produces green fluorescent protein that is the same as that produced by the jellyfish from which the gene was originally isolated. How is this possible? In other words, how can a bacterial cell produce a protein normally made by a eukaryote? What does this tell us about transcription and translation in these two organisms? Please explain.

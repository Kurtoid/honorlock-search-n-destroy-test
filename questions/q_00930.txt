Tableau Task 4        (max 10 pts)   Create a new worksheet in your Tableau workbook.  Name it "Filled Map".   Management wants a map that shows graphically shows which states make the biggest contribution to corporate revenue.  An unskilled user should be able to change the map to display either all of our restaurants or to filter for a single chain.   Create a filled map visualization as follows:  States where we have zero restaurants should not be filled. States where we have at least one restaurant should be completely filled. The color of the fill should be controlled by total sales.  To better convey the idea of "money" please setup the map to use shades of green.  Higher total sales = darker green.  Lower total sales = lighter green. Setup a filter based on the restaurant chain name.  Setup the Viz so that the filter is displayed at the top-right corner of the screen.  That way, an unskilled user can quickly change the filter to display a different chain (or all of the chains) by just clicking a checkbox. Configure the Tooltip to display the following data items:  State, Total Customer Visits, Total Sales.    NOTES:   This task will be graded manually, based on our evaluation of the TWBX file you submit.

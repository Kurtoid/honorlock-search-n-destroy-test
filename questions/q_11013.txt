Dr. Costas is conducting a study on babies' language development. Dr. Costas finds that babies can recognize when sounds change most of the time no matter what language the syllables come from birth to about 6 months. After 6 months of age, babies gradually lose the ability to recognize differences in sounds that are not important in their own language. What is most likely happening in the babies' brains that is causing this loss of ability and language specification?

a) Briefly summarize the post-translational regulation of human phosphofructokinase-1. Include in your summary the physiological context for each regulatory aspect. b) It has been found the activity of an isozyme of phosphofructokinase-1 within a thermophilic bacterium is regulated by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP).  How would you predict these molecules regulate this enzyme? Specifically, how do these molecules bind the enzyme and what are their effects on the enzyme's activity (include pertinent details)? What does this altered regulation suggest about how this bacteria generates energy when using this enzyme?

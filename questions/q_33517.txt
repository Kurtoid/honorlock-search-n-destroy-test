Operative Report  Preoperative Diagnosis: History of recurrent foreskin infection Postoperative Diagnosis: Same Procedure: Circumcision Indications: The patient has had some evidence of recurrent foreskin infection and his wife has had recurrent infections. Her gynecologist recommended that Mr. K. undergo circumcision. The patient presented at this time to complete that recommendation. Procedure: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position. General anesthetic was initiated. After good anesthesia was achieved, the patient's penis was prepped and draped in the appropriate fashion. A straight hemostat was used to crush the foreskin on the dorsal aspect first. After it had been placed for a period of time, the hemostat was released and the crushed segment was then divided. A similar action was performed on the ventral side. This was done down to the desired site of the circumcision. Then a 3-0 chromic suture was placed on the dorsum ventral side connecting the cut ends of tissue. Curved hemostats were used circumferentially around the penis on the right side to the desired length of circumcision. After the tissue was crushed, it was divided and then the excess foreskin was removed. Good hemostasis was achieved using the Bovie, and the remaining cut ends of the tissue were reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 chromic suture. Similar action was done on the left side. Remaining cut edges of the tissue were reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.

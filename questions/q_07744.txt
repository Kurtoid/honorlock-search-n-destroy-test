The patient was admitted to the hospital for other medical conditions. The patient was seen in consultation by a dermatologic surgeon at the request of his primary care physician. The 53-year-old male had two lesions on his scalp. One lesion was 1.2cm x 1.3 cm x 1.0cm on the posterior scalp and was slightly raised and slightly erythematous. After injection of local anesthesia in the center of the lesion, a 3-mm punch biopsy was performed. The biopsied tissue was then removed and sent for frozen section to pathology. The frozen section was positive for basal cell carcinoma. A 5-0 Prolene stitch was used to close the defect. The patient had a second lesion about 2 cm away from the first lesion and measuring 0.5 cm x 0.2 cm. The lesion was excised by using a sharpened scalpel to penetrate the skin and dermis on both sides. This lesion was then removed and sent to pathology. The second lesion was reported to be an actinic keratosis and excised in its entirety. It was closed witb a 5-0 Prolene stitch times two. Steri-strip were applied. We informed the patient that we will refer him to a plastic surgeon for removal of the basal cell carcinoma, as this may require significant undermining and wound closure may be problematic because of the size of the le ion. There is quite a bit of tension on the patient' scalp and the excision of the basal cell carcinoma will require the skill of a plastic surgeon. The patient will be seen for follow-up in this surgeon's office in seven days and was given the name and phone number of the plastic surgeon to call for an appointment within the next two weeks.  Code the diagnosis and procedure performed as a result of the consultation.

The compound interest equation shows how much a given amount of 'money' will be worth after t years (t is a positive integer) based on the interest rate r (r is in decimals) :   [in case image above is not visible, here is the formula:                                        future_value = money*(   (1 + r/12)^12t  )  ] First ask the user for How much Money: and Interest Rate (percent):  Write a program to display how many years it will take to make their 'money' at least x*times of the given 'money' (x is positive integer greater than 1 given by the user).  (Note: the user will give r in %age but you need to divide it by 100 and then use it in the formula) money = input('How much Money: ');r = input('Interest rate (percent): ');x = input('How many times do you want to make your money? ');   Test Case 1: How much Money: 100Interest rate (percent): 12How many times do you want to make your money? 2It will take 6 years to make your money 2 times!

Only your stats class is sampled for individual student heights, where the population is all of the students at Huntingdon College.  If you plot the individual heights of members of your class in a histogram, this is a sampling distribution.
You are asked to determine the concentration of Legionella pneumophila in a cooling tower sample. You take 1 mL of the cooling tower sample and add it to 9 mL of sterile water. This action yields "Dilution #1". You take 1 mL of "Dilution #1" and add it to 99 mL of sterile water to make "Dilution #2". Finally, you take 100 microliters of "Dilution #2 and inoculate a plate of GVPC medium that allows the cultivation of Legionella pneumophila. Four days later, you count 25 colonies of Legionella pneumophila. What is the CFU/mL of the Legionella pneumophila in the original cooling tower sample.

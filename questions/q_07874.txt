Then he sees God, pure, never-born, everlasting; and when he sees God he is free from all bondage.  This is the God whose light illumines all creation, the Creator of all from the beginning.  He was, he is and for ever he shall be.  He is in all and he sees all." b)  ". . . when we argue that pleasure is the end and aim of life, we do not mean the pleasure of prodigals and sensualists . . . .  We mean the pleasure of being free from pain of body and anxiety of mind.  It is not a continual round of drunken debauches and lecherous delights . . . but sober reasoning, searching out the motives of choice and avoidance, and escaping the bondage of opinion, to which the greatest disturbances of spirit are due . . . . [the wise man] believes that what chance bestows is not the good and evil that determine a man's blessedness in life, but the starting-points from which each person can arrive at great good or great evil."  c)     " 'Oh, but doom will crush me. . . .    A father's hands are stained, / blood of a young girl streaks the altar.    Pain both ways and what is worse?    Desert the fleets, fail the alliance?    No, but stop the winds with a virgin's blood,    feed their lust, their fury? -feed their fury! -/ Law is law!. . . .'    And once he slipped his neck in the strap of Fate,     his spirit veering black, impure, unholy,    once he turned he stopped at nothing, / seized with the frenzy. . . ."

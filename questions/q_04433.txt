Read the following paragraph and answer the question.      Speech anxiety, a fear of speaking in public, is one of the most common anxiety disorders.  In fact, many students refuse to enroll in public speaking courses because of this overwhelming fear.  Unlike math anxiety, it is not a matter of mastering basic concepts. Instead, it involves being familiar with the styles and formats of effective speech making.  Like math anxiety, getting a friend to help you might be a good way to cope with this type of stress.  Practice in front of a friend and let him or her give you some feedback.  Just as you should develop a positive feeling toward math, so should you engage in positive visualization.   Take deep breaths and imagine giving the speech with self-confidence, receiving wonderful feedback and compliments about your performance. List the three transitions that indicate a compare/contrast relationship in this paragraph.

Here are steps of muscle contraction, in jumbled order. A. Calcium ions are released into the sarcoplasm.   B. Calcium ions combine with troponin, pulling away the tropomyosin, allowing the myosin heads to bind to the actin. The myosin head has an ATP molecule attached to it already, which undergoes hydrolysis.   C. A nerve impulse travels along the sarcolemma, down the T-tubules, and reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum   D. As the crossbridge forms, ADP and a phosphate group are released from the myosin head, resulting in the power stroke   E. After the nerve impulse ceases, calcium is returned to its storage location by active transport.

Write a function called weather() that takes in one parameter: a weather list (list of tuples). The first element of each tuple is the date (str), the second element is a descriptor of the weather (str), and the third element is the temperature (int). The function should create and return a dictionary that maps each descriptor to a list of tuples of dates and their temperatures from the weather list that match the descriptor.  Example Output #1: >>> weatherList = [("1/10", "cold", 45), ("2/04", "sunny", 67),("8/27", "hot", 98), ("12/10", "cold", 32)]>>> weather(weatherList){"cold": [("1/10", 45), ("12/10", 32)], "sunny": [("2/04", 67)], "hot": [("8/27", 98)]}  Example Output #2: >>> weatherList = [("10/14", "rainy", 22), ("7/26", "foggy", 72), ("1/23", "foggy", 62), ("10/31", "windy", 45), ("12/23", "snowy", 22)]>>> weather(weatherList){"rainy": [("10/14", 22)], "foggy": [("7/26", 72), ("1/23", 62)], "windy": [("10/31", 45)], "snowy": [("12/23", 22)]}

Please use the following information to answer the question(s) below.Trichoplax adhaerens (Tp) is the only living species in the phylum Placozoa. Individuals are about 1 mm wide and only 27 mm high, are irregularly shaped, and consist of a total of about 2,000 cells, which are diploid (2n = 12). There are four types of cells, none of which is a nerve or muscle cell, and none of which has a cell wall. They move using cilia, and any "edge" can lead. Tp feeds on marine microbes, mostly unicellular green algae, by crawling atop the algae and trapping it between its ventral surface and the substrate. Enzymes are then secreted onto the algae, and the resulting nutrients are absorbed. Tp sperm cells have never been observed, nor have embryos past the 64-cell (blastula) stage.Tp's body symmetry seems to be most like that of

Consider the design of two logic circuits that both have four inputs: A, B, C and D; and one output: X.  Each circuit is implemented using 4-input AND gates (with negated inputs) and an OR gate to generate the output.  For circuit 1, X is defined to be 1 if and only if the unsigned binary representation of A, B, C and D is greater than 7.Note A is the most significant bit, then B, then C, and D is the least significant. For circuit 2, X is defined to be 1 if and only if the total number of 1's among A, B, C and D is exactly 2.  Which of the following 4-input gates would be used in the implementation of both circuits?

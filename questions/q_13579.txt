Given , the 2x2 gradient of the cost with respect to the convolutional layer , and the 2x2 weights , perform the backward pass and return , the gradient of the cost with respect to , the output activations from the previous layer. Note that we want the resulting value at [2,2] (indexing starts at 1) of the gradient . Assume the usual convolutional layer implementation (forward pass is cross-correlation).   Note: the kernel was applied with no padding and stride=1 ;     dh11 = [dh11] dh12 = [dh12]   dh21 = [dh21] dh22 = [dh22]         w11 = [w11] w12 = [w12]   w21 = [w21] w22 = [w22]

Thus, the two distinct forms are connected by gradual variation in morphological, behavioral, and genetic traits.

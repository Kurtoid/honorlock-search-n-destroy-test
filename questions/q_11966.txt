Write the pseudocode of a program (process P1) that creates a child process (P2), which in turn creates its own child process (P3). Make sure that your program does not yield more than 3 processes when executed. Let P1 and P3 communicate through a pipe where P1 is the reader and P3 is the writer. P1 should keep reading from the pipe into a buffer of size N, where N is the value of command line argument 1. It continues reading until there won't be any more data. P3 should write ``Hello, grandma'' to the pipe each time and for a total of M number of times, where M is the value of command line argument 2. Make sure that each process closes the end of the pipe that it does not use. Also, the processes should terminate in the following order: P3, P2, and P1.

A private university is owned and operated by a religious organization. The university is accredited by the department of education of the state in which it is located. This accreditation certifies that the university meets prescribed educational standards. Because it is accredited, the university qualifies for state funding for certain of its operating expenses. Under this funding program, 25 percent of the university's total operating budget comes from state funds.A professor at the university was a part-time columnist for the local newspaper. In one of her published columns, the professor argued that "religion has become a negative force in society." The university subsequently discharged the professor, giving as its sole reason for the dismissal her authorship and publication of this column. The professor sued the university, claiming only that her discharge violated her constitutional right to freedom of speech. The university moved to dismiss the professor's lawsuit on the ground that the U.S. Constitution does not provide the professor with a cause of action in this case. Should the court grant the university's motion to dismiss?

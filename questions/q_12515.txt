[Note: be sure to differentiate between wealth and income appropriately in your response (as I have done in the question).] Figure 16.6 from our text is provided below, which shows the distribution of wealth in the U.S. in 2013.  How does the distribution of wealth in the U.S. compare to the distribution of income?  In other words, is wealth more / less equally distributed than income? Consider Household A, which is in the top 1% of the chart, and Household B, which is in the bottom 40%.  How does this distribution of wealth impact the 2013 incomes of these two households?  How is it likely to affect the incomes of their offspring, when their offspring are adults? How might Piketty use this graph to confirm his arguments?  Would he want another graph to place alongside this one, and if so, what graph would that be?  What would his "solution" be?

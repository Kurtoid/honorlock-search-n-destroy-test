1.Suppose we have a ring made of gold, and we melt it down.  Has anything gone out of existence?  Are there problems that arise if we say 'Yes'?  Are there problems that arise if we say 'No'?  Present some of the immediate problems with each answer, and then discuss some variety of views (at least 3 altogether) which try to address these problems in presenting an overall view about what there is and how things persist.  Discuss the views critically and in enough detail to explain how the view addresses (or fails to address) the relevant problems.  (You may find it useful to see how the views would also handle these questions - Does it make a difference if instead of melting it, we chop it up?  What if some simples are destroyed in the process?) (YOU CANNOT WRITE ON THIS IF YOU ARE: HUCK, ASHLEY, SMIT, DAVID)

Auburn has been directed to upgrade its primary WWTP to a secondary plant that can meet an effluent standard of 25 mg/L BOD5 and 30 mg/L SS. In consultation with AU faculty, the city has selected a completely mixed activated sludge system. It is estimated that the BOD5 of the SS is equal to 70% of the SS concentration. The following data are also available from the existing primary plant. Flow= 0.250 m3/sec; influent BOD5 =64.0 mg/L; X= 1,500 mg/L MLVSS in aeration tank Growth constants: Ks= 110 mg/L BOD5; umax= 3.0/day; kd= 0.06/day; Y= 0.60 mg VSS/mg BOD5 removed
The incomplete reaction shown below is a so-called Prins pinacol reaction. The second part of the reaction's mechanism is analogous to that of a pinacol rearrangement (covered in class). Consider the Prins pinacol reaction below, particularly the cationic intermediate shown and the curved arrows illustrating the next mechanistic step, and answer the following questions.  Which of the following cations (A-F) represents the intermediate formed in the mechanistic step that is illustrated above (with curved arrow)? [intermediate1] Which of the following cations (A-F) represents the mechanistic intermediate that would form following the one you selected above? [intermediate2]  Which of the following molecules (G-J) would be the expected major product of the reaction? [product]  How many new chiral centers are established in the course of the reaction? [chiralcenters]

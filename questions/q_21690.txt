( 3 pts.) Two 4.0-kg point masses, m1 and m2, are attached to either end of a massless rod of length 1.60 m. The system rotates initially with angular velocity 20 rad/s about an axis that is perpendicular to the rod and passes through its center. Mass m2 is now pulled radially inward toward the axis of rotation until it is half its original distance from the axis. What is the new angular velocity of the system? Ignore friction.
Questions 12 through 15 are based on the passage below: 1          Long before the process of my vocational self-examination (justification) began I once cornered and talked to a high wire artist in a small traveling circus. I asked him why he chose that particular way of making a living. The first few minutes were filled with circus romance - the thrill of hurling through space, feeling at the last instant that pasty flesh of two always welcomed hands pressing around the wrists, swinging you forward to the next set of pasty hands which in turn deliver you safely back to the starting platform; the joy of laughter and approval and applause in the eyes of "children of all ages," the clanking of train wheels moving you on to the next city; even the part about it being a comfortable life with good pay. But finally he said what I had not expected him to say. "Now you really want to know why I go up there on that damned thing night after night after night?" I said I did. "Man, I would have quit it a long time ago. But my sister is up there. And my wife and my father are up there. My sister has more troubles than Job. My wife is a devil-may-care nut and my old man is getting older. If I wasn't up there, some bad night, man . . . smash!" His foot stomped the floor with a bone cracking thud. 19                                "H'mmm." 20                                He started to walk away but I had one more question to ask and ran after him. "But why do they stay up there?" He looked like he didn't want to answer, wasn't going to answer. But then he did. Turning from the door of the boy's locker room in the county seat high school, with a brown craft cardboard box and heavy crayola sign: MEN'S COSTUMES above it for the evening's performance, he looked me up and down and then, as he disappeared, blurted it out: "Because I drink too much!" -- Will Campbell, "Vocation as Grace"   Question 12: Why does Campbell call this story "Vocation as Grace"?

Most of you came here with some pretty strong opinions about what literature is, what it can or even should be. You may not have even been aware of having these ideas. They were not necessarily ideas you had formed, but principles extrapolated from things you had either observed or been told. Some of these ideas may have been pretty straightforward, with an apparent (if misguided) moral basis. Think of "profanity has no place in literature." Seems reasonable enough. Maybe it's connected to this idea that literature should be beautiful or something, and that profanity's ugly, or maybe it means literature should be moral, and profanity's immoral, so it can't be literature, or maybe it has something to do with education, like if the writer can't think of a classier word then maybe he or she is not a very talented writer. Turns out all of this is nonsense. Sometimes, as we learned from Etheridge Knight, "fuck" is not an inappropriate word but rather the only appropriate word, and a lot of the reason why certain parties would like for you to believe otherwise has to do with them not wanting you to understand where a writer like Knight is coming from and what he's trying to say and why profanity's the right way to say it. Or let's say you didn't have a problem with Knight's language, but you didn't think literature could be so political. Let's say you didn't think graphic depictions of lesbian sex belonged in literature. Let's say you thought the sentences were supposed to be make sense. Well, both of those ideas have been out of date since 1914, and so on. Let's say you thought Ernest Hemingway was the great American patriotic sportsman and now you're confronted with an antiwar atheist. Let's say you thought Anne Sexton ruined the fairy tales. That makes you Glen Matlock, by the way. He's the guy who got thrown out of the Sext Pistols for complaining when they changed the words to "Johnny B. Good." "But you can't," he said. "It's a classic." Goodbye Glen Matlock. Hello Sid Vicious. What's that you say? Great literature has to be original. It can't be in translation? Allow me to introduce Mr. Ezra Pound, the inventor of Modern poetry in the English language as you understand it. You can see what I'm getting at here.  Put it like this: Which of these writers and works was most difficult for you to accept under the umbrella of literature? What were the gaps in your background and the deficiencies in your education that made it difficult for you. Note that this isn't your opportunity to stick to your guns, critique the materials, critique us, et cetera. You're being asked a question about yourself, which I want you to answer in the most sincere, soul-searching, and self-effacing manner possible. It is possible to learn. It is good to learn. Which one of these things threw you for a loop the most, and how did you resolve it, and how is your understanding of what literature is or can be different now? How are you going to make sure you're not Glen Matlock the next time we go round the prickly pear? You should be detailed here. Tell me which lines surprised you--which scenes, which quotes, which ideas.  Tell me how the boundaries of literature were pushed for you. It doesn't have to be a bad experience, though it can be difficult. And it doesn't have to mean something bad about you, either. Look, there are all kinds of words and ideas and subjects your humble professor doesn't want anywhere near his dinner table. Just remember that, with very few exceptions, a book is not a dinner table. Give me a good length essay for this one. Be thorough. Be authentic. Try to say something real. Keep your eyes on the book and on yourself. Those are your subjects. The book and the self. What did you learn?  Call it 500 words or so. Go.

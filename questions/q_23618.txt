In the Free Fall experiment you dropped a "picket fence" through a photogate and the computer recorded the time between the leading edges of the bars in the picket fence breaking the beam of the photogate. From this you found a graph of position x versus time t. Suppose this experiment were performed on a different planet, Planet X, resulting in the graph shown. What is the acceleration due to gravity on Planet X? Note: The equation for the best-fit line is:    0.8478x^2 + 0.418x + 1x10^(-5)

QUESTION 4     Use this information to answer the following questions: You push a 3.5kg tin resting on a tabletop to the right and you have to exert a force of 2.67 N to start the tin sliding. Once it is sliding, however, you can use a force of only 1.5 N to keep the tin moving with a constant speed.         4.1   What is the magnitude and direction of the normal force?   (2)     4.2   What is the coefficient of static friction between the table and the tin?   (2)     4.3   What is the kinetic frictional force?   (2)     4.4   What is the resultant/net force on the tin while it is moving?   (2)     4.5   Draw a force diagram for the tin as it is sliding in a positive direction to the right.Make sure to include all labels and values.   (3)             [11]

Suppose that the PDF (probability distribution function) for the number of years it takes to earn a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree is given in the following table.     x P(x)   3 [a]   4    5 [b]   6 [c]   7 [d]     Let X = the number of years it takes to earn a bachelor's of science degree.  Let P(x) = the probability that  it will take x years. Find P(x=4), which is the missing probability in the table above. Hint:  The sum of the probabilities in the P(x) column should equal to 1.

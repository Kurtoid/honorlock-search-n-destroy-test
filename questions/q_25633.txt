The flesh of a dead animal is broken down by many types of decomposers. During the last part of this process, the flesh is turned into small soluble nutrients, such as ions of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, which can be used by plants in primary production. This final part of the decomposition process is known as
An opaque ring outlining the cornea, sometimes resulting from the deposit of fatty globules and aging is:
carbonate CO3-2    chlorate ClO3-1    chlorite ClO2-1    chromate CrO4-2    cyanide  CN-1     If you were to dissolve potassium carbonate, K2CO3, in water,  what ions would be dissolved in the solution? Choose the letter of the correct response. A) K22+(aq) + CO32-(aq) B) 2K2+(aq) + CO32-(aq) C) 2K+(aq) + CO32-(aq) D) 2K+(aq) + C(s) + O32-(aq) E) no ions would be dissolved in solution

She feared that the show would be sold out if she waited to purchase tickets when she arrived in town, so on June 1, the woman mailed a letter to an old friend who lived in the city asking him if he would purchase the tickets for her in exchange for a $100 fee. The friend replied by letter on June 5th that he would do so. But on June 6th, he decided that he didn't feel like waiting in line for the tickets after all so he sent a text to the woman telling her that her request was too much to ask of him and that he would not get the tickets for her.

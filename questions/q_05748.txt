Problem  No. 1  A double angle shape, 2L6x4x5/16 is connected by a  3/4 -in gusset plate with LLBB as shown below.  The total tensile service load (unfactored load)  applied is it is 25% dead load and 75% live load.  The bolts are 7/8-in-diameter, A325 bearing-type.  The angle material is A572 Grade 50 steel, and the gusset is A36 steel. Hint: Check all possible failure possibilities, including block shear. Gage spacing (bolt raw spacing) see Manual p1-52 (Table 1-7A). Based on this answer the following question: Question 1.6: For the spacing of rows of bolts as per Table 1-7A in the Steel Manual what i g1 ? [Enter value in inches]

Craig Moritz and colleagues examined how the distribution of 28 small mammal species in Yosemite National Park has changed over the past century by resurveying plots initially surveyed between 1914 and 1920 by Joseph Grinnell. Moritz and colleagues then generated curves showing the probability (0-1) of finding a given species at a particular elevation. Their research showed that ranges for 6 species expanded, ranges for 10 contracted, and 12 showed no change. The historic and current elevation probability curves for the alpine chipmunk (Tamias alpinus), bushy-tailed woodrat (Neotoma cinerea), and pinyon mouse (Peromyscus truei) are shown below.According to the graphs, for which of the three species did the range expand upslope?

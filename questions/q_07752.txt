Examine the following is true for a closed economy examining only the short-run. C = 1,000 + (3/4)*(Y - T) I = 13,000 - 125,000*r Gbar = 4,000 Tbar = 4,000 Mbar = 24,000 P = 2 L(Y,r) = Y - 100,000*r   a) Derive the IS and LM curves and use them to calculate the short-run equilibrium level of output (Y), the real interest rate (r), consumption (C), and investment (I). b) If the government wanted to increase output by 500 from it's value in (a) (so that the change in Y = 500) in the short-run by increasing government expenditures and keeping taxes unchanged, calculate what the new real interest rate (r) would have to be equal to and by how much G would have to increase by to achieve the desired increase in Y.

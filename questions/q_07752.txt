(40 minutes) Liquid oxygen flows through a tube of outside diameter 30 mm, the outer surface of which has an emissivity of 0.03 and a temperature of 85 K. This tube is enclosed by a larger concentric tube of inside diameter 50 mm, the inner surface of which has an emissivity of 0.05 and a temperature of 290 K. The space between the tubes is evacuated. Determine the heat gain by the oxygen per unit length of inner tube. How much is the heat gain reduced if a thin-walled radiation shield with an emissivity of 0.03 on each side is placed midway between the tubes?

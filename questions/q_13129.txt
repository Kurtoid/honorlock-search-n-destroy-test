Assume that the average visual reaction time for all the students (70 students) in a class was 0.285 seconds (standard deviation = 0.075 seconds).  Also, assume that these data are normally distributed.  What is the probability that a student selected randomly from this class will have a visual reaction time between 0.210 seconds and 0.285 seconds?  Note: z-score table below and z = [y-average] / stdev.
Consider the following scenarios where you are trying to construct a confidence interval. Determine which distribution you would use to construct a confidence interval: the standard normal () or the t-distribution ().

Allie, Benton, and Cathy are planning to mix red and yellow paint. They are considering which of the two following paint mixtures will make a more yellow paint.             A mixture of 4 cups red and 5 cups yellow             A mixture of 6 cups red and 7 cups yellow Allie says that both paints will look the same because to make the second mixture you just add 1 cup of each color to the first mixture. Benton says that the second mixture should be more yellow than the first because it uses more yellow than the first mixture.

Which paint will be more yellow, and why? Use a ratio table to solve this problem in two different ways, explain in detail why you can solve the problem the way you do.

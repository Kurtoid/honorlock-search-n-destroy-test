Johnny: 2021-02-25-SAR-Johnny-final-report-redacted-1.pdf    Johnny died in hospital in January 2018. He was 67 years of age. He had complex physical and mental health needs. He was entitled to Section 117 Mental Health Act aftercare having previously been detained under that Act. He had been supported to live as independently as possible in his own property which was situated in a neighbouring local authority area. When these arrangements came under strain he began to be repeatedly admitted to hospital until he agreed to a nursing home placement in the Manchester City Council area a little over a year prior to his death. Johnny never settled in this placement and repeatedly asked to leave. Opportunities to review his placement were not taken and in the months prior to his death, several safeguarding concerns were raised.   The then Manchester Safeguarding Adults Board (now Manchester Safeguarding Partnership) decided to undertake a safeguarding adults review (SAR) on the grounds that neglect may have been a contributory factor in Johnny's death and there were concerns that partner agencies could have worked together more effectively to protect Johnny.   Choose and answer TWO of the following questions:     Identify and evaluate some of the difficulties that key agencies faced in working together to share information and safeguard Johnny.  Evaluate the extent to which Making Safeguarding Personal was used to support and work with Johnny.    Choose one of the agencies involved in Johnny's case. What is your analysis of their role in this case?    What do you think is the most important piece of learning from this case? Why do you think this?

Use it or lose it In 1801, a biologist named Lamarck published a model of evolution. In his model, traits evolve according to the way that organisms use them. For example, giraffes had short necks that could not reach the leaves at the top of the tree (Figure 1). If a giraffe stretched its neck to reach these leaves, its offspring would have longer necks than usual. As giraffes needed to stretch higher, the average neck size in the population would increase. Thus, the traits of a species would evolve according to their use to individuals in a population. In a similar way, traits could disappear if they were not used. For example, if giraffes were to start feeding on grass instead of leaves, the necks of their offspring would be shorter. Over generations of disuse, necks of giraffes would return to a small size. This model has been used by some biologists to infer that elephants have frequently used their trunks to grab far objects.  Figure 1. Stages by which giraffes would have evolved longer necks according to Lamarck's model. The numbers denote changes over time as giraffes needed to stretch higher to obtain food.   Use this information and your understanding of biology to answer questions 1-5.   1. Lamarck's model of evolution is best described as a mathematical model.
4) You are holding a bicycle wheel with a radius of 0.8m and a mass of 5 kg that is spinning counter-clockwise at 5 rev/s around the z-axis when viewed from above. a) What is the angular momentum of the bicycle wheel (magnitude and direction.)? b) You use your right hand to apply a friction force to the outer edge of the wheel. You want the wheel to stop in 5 seconds. How much force should you apply? c) If you are sitting on a frictionless spinning stool while stopping the wheel, will you begin to spin? Explain why or why not. If you do begin to spin, which direction will you spin?

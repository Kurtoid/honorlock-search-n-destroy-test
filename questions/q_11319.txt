You are given an array  of   distinct integers (indexed 1 through ) which are not arranged in any particular order. The objective is to determine the smallest and the second smallest  of these  integers (without sorting the whole array). Observe that the problem is trivial if  For the sake of simplicity, you can assume that   is a power of two. Develop an algorithm based on the divide and conquer principle to do so and express it in the form of pseudocode. Specifically, write a recursive function    that returns the smallest  and the second smallest integer  in the portion of the array starting from index  to   using the divide and conquer principle.  Note that we can solve the original problem, by simply calling your function with parameters of  No need to analyze your algorithm.

The nurse knows aspirin decreases platelet activity for the duration of the platelet's lifespan. How many days prior to the surgery should the nurse tell the client to stop taking aspirin?
Exam Policies  You are allowed to use Quartus II to write, compile, and test your code for this final exam question. You are not allowed to open files related to past work of any kind during the exam.  You should not be seen viewing code from lecture or a previous lab experiment during the exam. You are not allowed to use any outside resources during the exam.  This includes: internet searches, the textbook (hard or soft copy), prior lab reports, another student's work, another person, notes, lecture material, cell phones/tables/other electronic devices. Within Honorlock, you must allow screen sharing at all times.  If screen sharing is stopped, this will be seen as a violation of academic honesty.  If screen sharing is voluntarily ceased, your exam will be penalized with a loss of points, with a maximum penalty of a final exam score of 0 points.   Problem Statement An event detector system indicates whether an event (positive or negative edge) has occurred on an input signal. The output should be high if:  a transition from high to low (negative) has occurred on the input signal, from one positive clock transition to the next. a transition from low to high (positive) has occurred on the input signal, from one positive clock transition to the next.  If an event has occurred just prior to the last positive clock edge, the output is a 1 for one clock period; otherwise, it remains a 0.   A sample output is below.      Write a complete VHDL design description for this event detector, as a two-process or three-process FSM.   Use the following entity declaration for your design. entity event_det isport(    input : in std_logic;     clk : in std_logic;     rst_bar : in std_logic;     event1 : out std_logic );end event_det; Exam Submission  Write, compile, and functionally simulate your design in Quartus II. Upload a text file of your code to Canvas.  Code should include a header with your name, course, and date. Upload a screen shot of your functional simulation results to Canvas.

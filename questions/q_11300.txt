Fill in the blanks below so that the code correctly determines the lanes that a new value is on in a Skip List data structure. rand.nextBoolean() generates a random Boolean value (with a probability of .5 for true) and log2 returns the logarithm with base 2. After the code executes, levelOfNewValue should contain the highest level / lane that the new value is on.    Random rand = new Random(); int maxLevel =(int)log2(this.size()+1); int levelOfNewValue = 0; while ([BLANK1]) { [BLANK2] }

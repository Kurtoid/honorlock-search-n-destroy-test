Case Study 3 Kyle is a 12-year-old boy who reluctantly agreed to attend therapy after getting arrested for breaking into a grocery store. His mother reports feeling "exhausted," adding that it has been hard to raise a boy who "doesn't know the rules." Beginning as a young child, Kyle was unusually aggressive, bullying other children and taking their things. When confronted by his mother, stepfather, or a teacher, he tended to curse, punch, and show no concern for possible punishment. Disruptive, impulsive, and "fidgety," Kyle's mom suspected he may have ADHD and she advocated for him to be placed in a special education program in second grade. In fourth grade, he began seeing a psychiatrist for weekly sessions and medications. He was adherent only sporadically with both the medication and the therapy. When asked, he said his psychiatrist was "stupid." During the year prior your session, he had been caught stealing from school lockers (a cell phone, a jacket, a laptop computer), disciplined after "mugging" a classmate for his wallet, and suspended after multiple physical fights with classmates. He had been arrested twice for these behaviors. His mother and teachers agreed that although he could be charming to strangers, people quickly caught on to the fact that he was a "con artist." Kyle was consistently unremorseful, externalizing of blame, and uninterested in the feelings of others. He is disorganized, inattentive, and uninterested in instructions; he constantly loses his possessions. He generally does not do his homework, and when he does, his performance is erratic. When confronted about his poor performance, he tends to say, "And what are you going to do, shoot me?" Kyle, his mother, and his teachers agree that he is a loner and not well liked by his peers. Kyle lives with his mother, stepfather, and two younger half-siblings. His stepfather is unemployed, and his mother works part-time as a cashier in a grocery store. His biological father is in prison for drug possession. Both biological grandfathers have a history of alcohol dependence. Kyle's early history was normal. The pregnancy was uneventful, and he reached all of his milestones on time. Kyle has no known medical problems, alcohol or substance abuse, or participation in gang activities. He has been regularly truant from school but has neither run away nor stayed away from home until late at night. On mental status examination, Kyle was casually groomed and appeared his stated age of 12. He was fidgety and made sporadic eye contact with you. He said he was "mad" and insisted he would rather be in jail than in therapy. His speech was loud but coherent, goal directed, and of normal rate. His affect was irritable and angry. He had no obvious cognitive deficits but declined more formal testing. His insight was limited, and his judgment was poor by history.

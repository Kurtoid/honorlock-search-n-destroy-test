A 2-year-old child is brought to the clinic after developing a hoarse, bark-like cough during the night with "trouble catching his breath" according to the parent. The history reveals a 2 day history of low-grade fever and upper respiratory symptoms. On exam, the child has a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, occasional stridor when crying, and a temperature of 101.3degF. What is the next step in treatment for this child? Correct Answer: Prescribe oral dexamethasone for 2 days. This child has croup with milder symptoms and may be managed at home with oral steroids. IM steroids are given to children who are vomiting. Inpatient admission is considered for children with respiratory distress (rates between 70 and 90 breaths per minute, severe retractions, and stridor at rest). Racemic epinephrine is useful for more severe symptoms, especially for stridor, but is done in the ED or hospital and should always be combined with a steroid.

Translate the following passage into good, clear English. Partial credit will be given, so try to put something or at least a note for each word. Post primum bellum, civitas a tyranno malo recta est. Alterum bellum protinus contra tyrannum sacerdotes inceperunt. Multis rebus gestis, sacerdotes tyrannum non captum esse nuntiaverunt. Itaque, cives tyrannum sibi expellendum esse credebant. Solum signum expectabant. Luce clarissima a quattuor viris visa, copiae quam fortissimae contra tyrannum missae sunt. Dehinc revenientes milites tyrannum istum captum esse et urbem liberatam esse nuntiaverunt. Plures viri hoc bellum peius quam primum bellum esse putaverunt sed patriam cariorem quam vitam ipsam esse crediderunt. Tyranno pessimo expulso, cives ducem meliorem et sapientiorem quaesiverunt.

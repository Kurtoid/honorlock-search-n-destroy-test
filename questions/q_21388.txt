See It All Factory produces two similar products: small table lamps and desk lamps. The total factory overhead budget is $640,000 with 400,000 estimated direct labor hours. It is further estimated that small table lamp production will require 275,000 direct labor hours, and desk lamp production will need 125,000 direct labor hours.   Using a single plantwide factory overhead rate with an allocation base of direct labor hours, the factory overhead that See It All Factory will allocate to desk lamp production if actual direct labor hours for the period for desk lamps is 120,000 would be

You are tasked with enumerating the viral load of an unknown sample. You begin your investigation by serially diluting the sample resulting in the following dilutions: 10-2, 10-4, and 10-6. You spread 80ul of each dilution onto a separate nutrient agar plate and incubate for 48 hours. Upon examining the plates for the 10-2 and 10-6 dilutions only. You observe the following results:  10-2: 125 PFU  10-6: 90 PFU  Calculate the phage titer for these two agar plates. Report your final answer in the correct notation and with appropriate units.

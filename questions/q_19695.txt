On Free Response ANOVA items that require you to complete a table, you will need to use the Insert Table feature to input your tables.  You will also need to clearly state your hypotheses, critical value, test statistic, decision and conclusions. Eight observations were selected from each of 3 populations (total of 24 observations), and an analysis of variance was performed on the data. The following are part of the results.

Problem 2 The project network along with the normal and crash data are provided below. The project needs to be crashed to 17 days, that is the entire project should be finished in 17 days.   To crash the entire project to 17 days, which activities should be crashed and by how many days so that the crashing is done at the least possible additional cost (Please provide the sequence in which the project was crashed. Use as many rows in the table as you need; you may not need all 7 rows/steps and it's OK to leave the extra steps/rows blank).  PLEASE, no notes in the table. Strictly, only note the activities (e.g., "A"), days by which you crashed them (e.g., "3"), and the cost of crashing (e.g., "225"). You may describe your work in the next question/space    Step # Activity/activities crashed Days crashed Crashing cost   1 [A] [B] [C]   2 [D] [E] [F]   3 [G] [H] [I]   4 [J] [K] [L]   5 [M] [N] [O]   6 [P] [Q] [R]   7 [S] [T] [U]    You may describe briefly, each step of your crashing process, if you would like, in the following question.

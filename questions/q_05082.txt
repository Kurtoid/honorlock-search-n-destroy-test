Suppose a skier attaches a rocket to their back and uses it to propel them forward. On a flat surface, the skier travels [d] m with a force of [F] N. If the power produced by the rocket is [P] W, how long in seconds did it take for the skier to travel those [d] m? (1 W = 1 N m/s)
Consider a four-department layout problem where four departments (1, 2, 3, 4) are to be assigned to four locations (A, B, C, D).  The distances (left matrix) between each pair of locations and the number of trips per day (right matrix) between each pair of departments are shown in the matrices below:     A B C D   1 2 3 4   A --- 50 50 100  1 --- 3 8 5   B  --- 100 50  2  --- 4 2   C   --- 50  3   --- 7   D    ---  4    ---    Showing all necessary work, compute the total distance traveled for the following two layouts (e.g., A = 1 means department 1 is assigned to location A) (8 points) Layout 1: A = 1, B = 4, C = 2, D = 3 Layout 2: A = 3, B = 1, C = 2, D = 4

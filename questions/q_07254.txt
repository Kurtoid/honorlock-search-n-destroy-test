LRVM Consider a multithreaded process using the LRVM library.  Two threads in this process concurrently modify different persistent data structures (m1, m2, respectively) in the same memory region R1 as shown:    Thread T1                                                                        Thread T2  Begin transaction                                                           Begin transaction      Set-range (start-address-m1, sizeof(m1))                      Set-range (start-address-m2, sizeof(m2))                                           ...                                                                                        ...

(a) (2 points) (Answer True/False with justification)  "LRVM will abort T2's transaction."    (b) (2 points) (Answer True/False with justification)  "LRVM will ignore T1's abort since T2 is modifying persistent data in the same region."    (c) (2 points) (Answer True/False with justification)  "The above execution will result in creating one abort record and redo record on the disk."

Consider the illustration below, in which all nodes use the Google Spanner System. Each of the three nodes stores an object. The figure shows the execution history for the object and the timestamp associated with the write operation which produces the corresponding value of each of the objects. Client1 just issued a Write operation on ObjectY but has not yet received an acknowledgement that the write is committed. Client2 issues a Read* on ObjectY.      Select the correct answer to complete each of the sentences below:   a. If the read operation is a Read-Now, Client2's read will receive ObjectY=[q1] b. If the read operation is a Read-at-Timestamp(s=5), Client2's read will receive ObjectY=[q2] c. If the read operation is a Read-at-Timestamp(s=7), Client2's read will receive ObjectY=[q3]

You are working for a contractor that has a contract for construction of a new hospital. As part of the project, you need to remove the soil for the construction of the basement and foundation for a parking garage. From the project plans, you know that 5,000 bank cubic yards must be excavated and that 1050 compacted cubic yards will be required to backfill the completed foundation. You plan to stockpile the soil needed for backfill on site and haul the excess soil to a disposal site. The average haul distance is estimated to be 450 ft. with an 8% average uphill grade. The contractor had the soil tested and determined that the bank density is 2,880 pounds per cubic yard, the loose density is 2,300 pounds per cubic yard, and the compacted density is 3,200 pounds per cubic yard.  What is the percent swell for the soil? What is the percent shrinkage for the soil? How many bank cubic yards should be stockpiled to be used for backfill operation? How many loose cubic yards of soil should be hauled away to the disposal site?

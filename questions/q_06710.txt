At St. Edward's hospital, when patients afflicted with a certain disease are given the standard treatment, 20% show improvement in their symptoms. A new treatment for the disease has gained popularity at other hospitals, so the physicians at St. Edward's hospital decide to try the new treatment with 100 of their patients to test whether there is any difference in the new treatment's effectiveness. If 27 of the 100 patients given the new treatment show improvement, is this enough evidence to conclude with 95% certainty that the new treatment has a significantly different effect than the standard treatment?
The largest estuary in the United States is the Chesapeake Bay, which extends through six states. The Bay is one of the most productive natural areas in the world. It is home to thousands of plants and animals, including many commercially important species. The water of the Bay is relatively shallow. Many areas are no more than 10 feet deep, with an average depth of 30 feet. Light penetrates the shallow water and supports submerged plants that provide food and shelter for the many species living in the bay ecosystem. However, like many estuaries, the Bay receives large amounts of fertilizer runoff from farms, lawns, and wastewater treatment facilities. Which is the most probable sequence of events when fertilizer runoff reaches the Bay?

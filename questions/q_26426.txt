Physician Office Record Office Notes: Mr. Hafner is a 51-year-old white male who has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He had esophageal dilatation for a Schatzki's ring since the last time he was here in April because of swallowing difficulties. He claims that since then he has had no problems with his swallowing and even his heartburn has improved a lot. He denies any chest pains or any shortness of breath. He is still taking Prilosec for symptoms of reflux. The patient is on lovastatin for hyperlipidemia. He is severely overweight, but he is not motivated to lose weight. He is not working and yet he does not do any kind of exercise. Physical exam shows a well-developed, very obese male who does not appear to be in any distress. He is nonchalant about his problems and what he is more interested in is symptomatic relief of his symptoms rather than his hypertension or risk of cardiovascular disease. His vital signs today show a blood pressure of 132/84, heart rate is 110 bpm, weight is 231.5 pounds which is one and one half pounds more than what he weighed last time. He has no pallor, no jaundice. Neck shows no jugular venous distention. Heart is regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Extremities show no edema. Assessment: Blood pressure is normal. I changed his anti-hypertensive from hydrochlorothiazide to atenolol for better control of his blood pressure.  His last cholesterol profile was done in October when he had an LDL of 130, HDL of 40 and triglycerides of 213. He is on lovastatin for hyperlipidemia for which I will continue the dose of 20 mg daily. In term of his severe obesity, the patient is unmotivated, but I advised him on exercises that he can do and a more healthful diet consisting of mostly vegetables and salads.  I will continue the Prilosec since it offers symptomatic relief of his reflux. His next visit will be in four months.

A small investment fund has a $345 million equity portfolio with a beta of 0.96. The current futures price for a contract on the S&P 500 Index is $3,920. Recall that S&P 500 Index Futures contracts are 250 times the value of the index. How many futures contracts should be sold to reduce the total beta of the portfolio to 0.60?

Operation Warp Speed relies on Fedex and UPS to distribute COVID-19 vaccines across the US. Fedex handles shipments to the Western US and UPS manages those to the East. Operation Warp Speed moves the vaccine in 45 lb boxes that each carry about 4,000 doses. Fedex charges $300 per box to move vaccines to the West Coast.  Fedex moves the vaccines to Los Angeles via airfreight in ULD's (Unit Load Devices). Each ULD can hold up to 64 boxes.   General Perna's team wants to trade off the costs of getting the vaccine to states and counties in the Western US against the delays inherent in larger shipments. A larger shipment represents more Days of Supply, which means the vaccine waits longer to become a vaccination.  Demand for vaccines in Los Angeles County is estimated at 1.6 million doses (for the A+ portion of the population), which is about 11% of the total demand the Fedex hub will serve in the Western US.  The cost of a dose of vaccine is roughly $40. After long deliberations and an extensive scientific study considering perishability, risk of lives lost due to delays, etc., General Perna's team concluded an appropriate inventory holding cost for COVID vaccine is 50% for the period in question  Using these values, what is the ideal shipment size, measured in boxes, for sending vaccine to Los Angeles County that minimizes the 'total cost' for Operation Warp Speed?
Atlanta Recreation and Park Department is considering two mutually exclusive proposals for a new football complex on a city-owned lot.       Alternatives   Initial Investment   Annual maintenance Cost   Annual Benefit     A1   $800,000   $87,500   $194,000     A2   $1,000,000   $105,000   $224,000     The complex will be useful for 30 years and has no appreciable salvage value assumed. Assuming 8% MARR, which alternative should be selected, and why? Use Benefit-Cost analysis. (P/A, 8%, 30) = 11.258

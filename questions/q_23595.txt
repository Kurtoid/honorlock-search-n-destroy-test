(40 points)   Prism Specialty Chemical Co. v. Ding Control Systems, Inc.  United States District Court for the Southern District of California               In this action, a former customer has filed suit against Ding Control Systems, Inc. (Ding).  Ding, a Delaware corporation headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, makes large, computer-controlled vessels used in industry for chemical synthesis (i.e., creating a desired chemical by combining other chemicals under special conditions such as high heat or pressure).  Ding also installs the vessels for its clients.                            The plaintiff alleges that Ding sold it defective vessels and that Ding's negligent installation of the machines led to damage to the plaintiff's factory.                 In September 2019, Ding's president, Tom Ding, attended a chemical manufacturing convention in Kansas City, Missouri.[1]  There, he met purchasing representatives from a California corporation, Prism Specialty Chemical Co. (Prism).                Over the two days of the convention, Tom Ding negotiated and formed a working relationship with Prism's representatives.  Later that year, the two firms met at Ding's headquarters in St. Louis, Mo., completed negotiations there, and entered into a contract for Prism to purchase customized pressure vessels from Ding.  One of the customized features was necessary in order to allow the vessels to be installed immediately adjacent to the factory floor in Prism's factory.  Ding also agreed to handle the installation of the machines.                 In early 2020, a technician hired by Ding installed the machines in Prism's headquarters factory in the suburbs of San Diego, California.  Prism alleges that the machines soon began to function poorly, failing to properly complete different chemical processes.  It alleges that in October 2020, one of Prism's machines malfunctioned during use and vented hot gas into the surrounding environment, causing some of the other adjacent vessels to catch fire.  The resultant fire damaged Prism's manufacturing plant.  The plaintiffs allege that Ding's employees installed the failed machine in an unsafe location that caused the gas venting and the resultant fire to be particularly destructive.               Last month, Prism filed suit against Ding Control Systems in federal court in the Southern District of California, in San Diego.  Prism asserts a claim for negligence, arguing that Ding failed to use reasonable care in (a) designing the vessels and/or (b) installing the pressure vessels in Prism's factory, and that these failures caused $350,000 in damage to Prism's factory, plus (claims Prism) an additional sum of punitive damages.  Prism also asserts a claim of breach of warranty against Ding, seeking $100,000 in damages - the cost of the purchase and the installation fee.                 Ding denies liability, arguing that the vessels were properly designed, and that its customer misused them by failing to perform regular maintenance on them.               Disputed issues will likely include the design of the vessels, what caused the failure, whether Prism maintained the vessels properly, and the reasonableness of decisions that Ding's field technician made while installing the machines in Prism's factory.                 Prism plans to call as a witness the managers of its factory, and the purchasing representatives who negotiated the contracts with Ding at the convention.  Prism will also call a local expert witness who will testify that Ding's technician improperly installed the pressure vessel in Prism's factory.  Ding will call as witnesses its president Tom Ding; the company's chief product designer; and the technician who installed the machines in the plaintiffs' factories.   Important evidentiary exhibits at trial will likely include the contract documents; Prism's records showing when maintenance was performed on the vessels; and the remains of the damaged pressure vessel from Prism's factory.  The median time to trial in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri is 22 months from the filing of the action; the median time to trial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California is 36 months.               Ding does not believe the current forum, a federal court roughly 1800 miles from St. Louis, would be a convenient one in which to present its case.                            Therefore, Ding has filed a motion to transfer venue from the Southern District of California to the Eastern District of Missouri, where its headquarters is located.  The plaintiff opposes the motion.    Should the motion to transfer venue be granted?  Explain.        [1] NOTE: The state of Missouri is divided into two federal judicial districts.  The Eastern District of Missouri has its principal courthouse in St. Louis; the Western District of Missouri has its principal courthouse in Kansas City.

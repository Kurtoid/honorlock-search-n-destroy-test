By typing my name here, I am acknowledging that I have read and understood the Remote Proctor NOW Rules and Procedures. I understand the consequences for breaking these rules. I have contacted my instructor to clarify any misunderstandings about these rules and procedures.   Rules and Procedures for Testing with RPN:   RPN will ask to see an photo ID. Make sure your ID is clearly photographed, so that your name can be read and your picture has good resolution.  You will need to start the test by spinning your camera around the room. When you do this, spin it at a constant pace that takes 10 seconds to complete.  Make sure the entire room is covered, going up and down when necessary.  Also include the desk, and the space around it, that your computer is on.  To get the timing down so that your spin lasts 10 seconds, please practice. You may use any calculator on the test.  Show your calculator to the camera at the start of the test.  Some calculators have a lid or case that holds them. Do not play with the case or take the case on and off during a test. It is best to remove the case or lid from the room while testing.  The room must be silent.  Please inform everybody in your home that they must be quiet. Nobody should enter the room you are in.  Consider placing a "Do Not Enter" sign on your door. Absolutely no phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, or any other computerized devices can be anywhere in the room, with the one exception of the computer you are using.  There may be televisions, radios or stereos in the room but they must be turned off. You may not wear headphones while taking your test.  You may use a white board with a marker as your "scratch paper" to write your work out.  After each problem, show the camera your work and then show the camera that you are erasing the board.  At the beginning and end of the test, show the camera the blank board.  There should be no visible writing utensils (pen, paper, etc.) or lose paper or notebooks in the room. You may not use paper or notebooks as your scratch paper. There can be no writing, of any kind in the room that can be helpful on a test. This includes, but is not limited to, a poster with formulas on it, notes written on walls or furniture, a piece of paper with formulas or problems from the homework written on it.  The consequence for violating rules 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 is that the test you are taking will be a 0 and you will not be able to use RPN anymore. Violating rules 6, 7, or 8 is considered academic dishonesty (cheating) and your test grade will be a 0, and your course grade may be an F, with any additional consequences at the discrepancy of the instructor.

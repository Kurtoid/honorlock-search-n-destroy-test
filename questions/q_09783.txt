Given that 80% of the population is right-handed, find the probability that 340 or more are found in a random sample of size 400. This time use the normal approximation to the binomial. a) n=[n] b) p=[p] c) q=[q] d) What is the first value for x (a whole number) [x] e) Find the mean=np= [mean] and f) standard deviation [standard] Does the problem meet the conditions so we can use the normal distribution to approximate the binomial distribution?     A) Yes    B) No     Just type the letter [letter1] Which bell curve applies to the situation? [letter2] Just type the letter. A   B C      What value for x will be used when you apply the continuity correction? [x] What is the z-score? z=[zscore] Round to two decimal places. What is the probability that 340 or more out of 400 are right-handed? [prob] Round to four decimal places.

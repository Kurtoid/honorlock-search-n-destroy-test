Your little sister plays with a toy boat on an inclined plane of angle th = 30*. The bottom end of this inclined plane there is a spring with a spring constant of k = 500.0 N/m fastened securely at the bottom so that the spring is parallel to the surface as shown in the figure below. Her 2.5 kg toy boat is placed on the plane a distance d = 0.4 m from the spring. From this position, her toy boat is projected towards the spring with a speed v = 0.75 m/s.

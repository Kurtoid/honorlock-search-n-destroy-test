An RN reviews the ABG results of a patient in respiratory distress and notes: pH of 7.28, PCO2 of 49, and a HC03 of 26. Normal ranges: ph=7.35-7.45, CO2=35-45, HC03=22-26. The nurse interprets these results as:
A large ion like potassium (K+) would travel into the cell against its gradient through an electrogenic:
A healthy 38-year-old male presents to the primary care clinic following a rear-impact motor vehicle crash while stopped at a stoplight.  The incident occurred 48 hours ago.  He is now seeking treatment for complaints of neck pain which first presented as stiffness about 12 hours after the crash. He now reports pain at the base of his skull which is worsened with movement.  On examination, the patient reports tenderness over the posterior cervical spine. Range of motion of the cervical neck, particularly against resistance, is diminished. Spurling's sign is negative. Neurologic assessment of the upper and lower extremities is unremarkable. The patient has equal strength in both extremities.  Which of the following is the most probable diagnosis based upon this clinical presentation?
A 100.0 mL sample of 0.300 M NaOH is mixed with a 100.0 mL sample of 0.300 M HNO3 in a coffee cup calorimeter. If both solutions were initially at 35.00degC and the temperature of the resulting solution was recorded as 37.00degC, determine the DHdegrxn (in units of kJ/mol NaOH) for the neutralization reaction between aqueous NaOH and HCl. Assume 1) that no heat is lost to the calorimeter or the surroundings, and 2) that the density and the heat capacity of the resulting solution are the same as water: Density of H2O = 1.00 g/mL; heat capacity of water (specific heat) = 4.184 J/g. oC.

Mercury, also known as quicksilver, is one of the few elements that are in liquid form at room temperature. Over the centuries mercury has had many ritualistic and scientific uses, almost all of which have been discontinued as its toxic properties have come to be understood.  In ancient China and India, mercury was considered an aid to good health. Historians believe that an early Chinese emperor was driven insane and killed by mercury pills that were supposed to make him live forever.  In Europe and America in the 1700s and 1800s, mercury was used in the manufacture of felt for making hats. The mercury solutionthat the hat makers used was highly toxic. Symptoms included hallucinations and dementia--thus the origin of the phrase "mad as a hatter." Mercury was once widely used to treat syphilis, which caused confusion because mercury poisoning symptoms are so similar to those of the disease it was supposed to relieve. It was also used as a diuretic and as a laxative.  Although now banned in the United States, mercurochrome is still widely used around the world as a topical antiseptic. Mercury's use has been discontinued in home thermometers, herbicides, and light switches. Through its industrial uses it has entered thefood chain, showing up in potentially dangerous concentrations in some kinds of fish. Mercury is still used in dentistry.

Answer one only of the following essays. Map out the argument you intend to pursue, and support your claims therein with specific references to the examples (from lectures and readings) that verify your thesis. Also recall that the quotes below are merely included to suggest themes or issues to you, not to serve as the only thing about which you write.  Option A   "Sufism is generally perceived as spiritually focused and about the development of the self, a perception that many Sufis perpetuate through their self-representation. However, Sufi orders have been historically involved as important civic and political actors within the Muslim world by engaging in inter-faith dialogue, political challenges to religious orthodoxy, and activism. This has important implications for understanding the development of what is often referred to as the 'heart' of Islam. Sufis generally present the perception of Rumi and love poetry.. but at a deeper level Sufi orders, groups and organizations are political, active in inter-faith dialogue, and engage in changing society."                                         --Milad Milani, Sufi Political Thought As our readings and classroom presentations endeavored to show, Sufism holds a vital, yet complex, place in the history and development of Islam. At two levels, the spiritual and the political, one can argue that it violates basic Islamic assumptions, while others may say that it transcends rather than violates. Certainly, at the political level, in the centuries we've studied, it has been vital in preserving Islamic society.

For you are trying to cause its collapse from the outside, and we from the inside, but still she stands."                                                                                 --Fu`ad Pasha to a French diplomat, later 1800s After its heyday in the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire experienced a variety of tensions that often pulled it in contrary directions.

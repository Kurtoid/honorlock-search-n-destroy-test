A 37.7 cm long solenoid with diameter 7.33 cm has 1330 turns and a resistance of 9.23 O. It is connected to a programmable power supply which delivers a current I = 13.3(1- e -2.3 t) A when triggered. Wrapped coaxially inside the middle of the solenoid is another solenoid with a resistance of 1.37 O, a length of 9.37 cm, a diameter of 3.77 cm and 377 turns. Find the induced current in the second solenoid at time t = 337 ms after the power supply is triggered.

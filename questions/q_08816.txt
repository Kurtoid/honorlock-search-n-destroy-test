13) A research study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dementia on direct medical costs. Ninety demented residents were divided into three groups based on their level of dementia: mild, moderate, or severe. The medical claims data were collected from CMS Medicare database. Test the hypothesis at the alpha level of .05 that the average mean direct medical costs for the three groups are all equal. Assume that the direct medical costs for each group follow a normal distribution and that the population variances for the three groups are all equal. Based on this information, what is the most appropriate statistical method to test this hypothesis?

Perform the following hypothesis test: A particular brand of tires claims that its deluxe tire averages at least 50,000 miles before it needs to be replaced. From past studies of this tire, the standard deviation is known to be 8,000. A survey of owners of that tire design is conducted. From the 28 tires surveyed, the mean lifespan was 46,500 miles with a standard deviation of 9,800 miles. Using alpha = 0.05, is the data highly inconsistent with the claim? (You may assume that the underlying population is normally distributed.)   Is this a test of one mean or proportion? [a1] State the claim in mathematical form. [a2] (This is the [a16] hypothesis.) Identify the null and alternative hypothesis. H0: [a3] HA: [a4] We will use the [a5] distribution because the population standard deviation is [a6]. Is this a left, right, or two-tailed test? Select the matching graph. [a15] A. B. C. State the significance level. a = [a8] Calculate the p-value using technology. p-value = [a7] Compare the p-value to the significance level. p-value [a9] a, meaning that we will [a10] the H0. Therefore, because we [a11] the H0  and the original claim was the [a12], we find that there [a13] sufficient evidence to [a14] of the claim that its deluxe tire averages at least 50,000 miles before it needs to be replaced.

Two experiments from the paper are shown below. The top image is Figure 5A, where the researchers studied the effect of including AMP or ATP-g-S in the reactions. They noticed a high molecular weight band appearing in the reactions with AMP or ATP-g-S (labeled p53*). The bottom image is from Figure 6. The researchers performed the same reactions as in Figure 5A but then performed immunoprecipitation using a p53 antibody followed by a Western Blot utilizing an antibody targeting ubiquitin. Why does the higher molecular weight form of p53 (p53*) appear when AMP or ATP-g-S is included in the reaction? Would p53* occur if HPV 11 E6 is included in the reaction instead of HPV 18 E6?

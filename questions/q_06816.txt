Original passageI get my first glimpse of Stonehenge while mired in a five-mile traffic jam. It's just after midnight, a few hours before sunrise on summer solstice, the longest day of the year. From my car, I can see the familiar stones bathed in an eerie blue light that gives the venerable monument the feel of an empty film setthough it won't be empty for long. I'm one of 30,000 people hoping to see the sun rise over the stones. We've been stuck for hours on the A303, a highway that, infamously, runs just a few hundred yards from Stonehenge. At 2 in the morning, I pull into a parking lot reserved for solstice celebrants about a mile from the site. Security guards make sure I'm not carrying immoderate amounts of alcohol, and I walk the rest of the way with an exuberant crowd of new agers, students, and local residentsany one of whom could be a pagan.Eric A. Powell, "Solstice at the Stones," Archaeology Sept./Oct. 2003: 36. PARAPHRASE:  Powell relates his experience driving on a summer solstice to see the sun rise over Stonehenge. From where he is stuck in traffic on highway A303 at midnight, Stonehenge looks empty. However, 30,000 people will soon be there. It is 2 a.m. before he gets to the parking lot. Guards check to verify that he doesn't have too much alcohol, and he walks with the other celebrants the mile to the famous monument (36). I have heard that Stonehenge was closed to visitors for years, but, as Powell tells us, it is open once again to the public. I hope to go there on a summer solstice someday to share with others what must be a supremely mystical encounter.

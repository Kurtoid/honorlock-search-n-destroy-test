Problem 4. (20 points) A steel bar with circular cross-section is subjected to axial tensile force that varies from zero to Pmax. The ultimate tensile strength of the bar is 1,250 MPa. The fraction, f, of the ultimate tensile strength is 0.9 and the endurance limit of a polished specimen is 600 MPa. The stress concentration factor and notch sensitivity factor are 1.8 and 0.95 respectively. The reliability modification factor is given as 0.897. When the smallest diameter, d, of the bar is 26 mm, determine the maximum force (Pmax) that the bar can carry for 105 cycles. Assume the factor of the safety is 1.0. During the solution process, you should utilize one of the appropriate failure criteria.    Write down the obtained Pmax value. [answer_pmax]

Researchers are studying the average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline across   the country. Last year at this time, the average price at all stations nationwide was $3.17  per gallon, but this year, a random sample of 67 stations had an average price of $3.09  per gallon, with a standard deviation of $0.28 per gallon. These researchers would like to test that the average price at all stations nationwide is lower now than it was last year.  What alternative hypothesis should the researchers use to test their claim?

The FBI develops a computer program known as a "worm" program. It is designed to infiltrate any computer using a web browser or any other software to interact with a government computer, without the knowledge of the comput's owner. Once the worm program arrives on the us's computer, it locates any documents stored on the computer that are classified for national security purposes. It is a crime for an unauthorized person to possess classified national security documents. If such documents are present on the us's computer, the program sends out a message to notify authorities. If such documents are not present, the worm program erases itself and the user never knows that it was present on the computer. If the FBI disseminates this worm program as broadly as possible, does its use violate the constitution?

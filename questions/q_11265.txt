Group Design Choice 1 of 2   Luria, Vygotstky's student, once said: "language is a system of codes adequate for independently analyzing an object and expressing any of its features, properties, and relationships. The word is the foundation of the system of codes which ensures the transition from the sensory to the rational world" (Luria, 1982, p. 39). Therefore, the word, not reading and writing skills, becomes the main instrument of human conscious activity, or in other words, the mental tools of literate thought. Such an understanding of literate thought does not limit the mode of the word to print, which suggests that literate thought could be mode independent.   A. What is literate thought? What is your understanding of the mode independence nature of literate thought?   B. The mode independence nature of literate thought justifies New and Multiple Literacies as equal vehicles for the development of literate thought besides print literacy. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that literacy development in New and Multiple Literacies might contribute to the development of print literacy as well. An elementary school is running a New and Multiple Literacies program, a 10-week comprehension monitoring intervention for 24 3rd graders with specific language impairments in the afterschool program. Design one 45-minute lesson for the program. Make sure to include the following information:  The theme/content of the lesson The goals/behavioral objectives of the lesson What will you expect the students to do with teacher assistance? What will you expect the students to do independently or with little assistance?    C. You aim to test the efficacy of the 10-week intervention program by comparing students in this elementary school to those in the afterschool program of the neighboring elementary school, who did not receive the intervention. Design an intervention study to test this research aim.  Describe the participants in your overall sample and the sub-sample groups. What are three independent variables (including covariates) you will measure? Why and how will you collect data on those independent variables? What are two dependent variables you will measure? Why and how will you collect data on those dependent variables? Describe the group-level research design you will use, including when you will collect data on each of the variables above, and how your design addresses issues of validity. Write two testable research questions for your study. Your research questions should explicitly address the research aim.  Be sure that you have referred to each of the independent and dependent variables somewhere in the research questions. For each research question, describe the statistical analysis you will perform to test the research question. Be clear about how you will include each of your variables as part of the statistical analysis.

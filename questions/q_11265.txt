Part C (1 point) This question builds on the answers to Questions 2 and 3. Frank's Sausage is looking at a new sausage system with an installed cost of $480,000. This cost will be depreciated straight-line to zero over the project's 3-year life, at the end of which the sausage system can be scrapped for $70,000. The sausage system will save the firm $170,000 per year in pretax operating costs, and the system requires an initial investment in net working capital of $29,000. The net working capital associated with the project can be recovered at the end of the project. The tax rate is 34% and the discount rate is 10%. What is the net present value (NPV) of this project?   Answer to two decimal places. If your answer is a positive amount, omit the (+) sign. If your answer is negative, use a (-) sign.

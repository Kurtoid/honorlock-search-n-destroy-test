Below is a dynamic sequence of MIPS instructions proceeding through an in-order pipeline.  You can make the following assumptions. The integer operations, add and addi, require a single cycle addition.  Loads and stores take a cycle to calculate the effective address and an additional cycle to access the data cache.  Floating-point fadd.d and fsub.d operations requires 4 cycles to execute.  For each stall (stall1, stall2, and stall3) explain why the stall occurred. Instructions:  1. fadd.d f2,f0,f1 2. add x4,x5,x6 3. fld f1,4(x2) 4. fsub.d f3,f4.f5 5. addi x3,x2,1 6. fsd f3,8(x3) 7. fadd.d f4,f3,f2 8. lw x1,4(x2) 9. sw x1,8(x2)10. fsub.d f5,f2,f3

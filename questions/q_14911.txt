A baby girl receives a(n) ____ chromosome from her ______.
Which bacteria is/are rods?
2.d.) When a new node joins or leaves Dynamo there is the possibility of many trees having to be recalculated, causing significant overhead. For this question, you can assume that all nodes are identical and each physical node corresponds to only one virtual node (aka token). Assuming the strategy described in Section 4.2 (i.e. partitioning strategy 1 in Section 6.2) what trees have to be recalculated when a node leaves Dynamo? (Hint: consider the case when in Figure 2 in the reference paper node B leaves Dynamo and answer the question of what node C needs to store before and after node B crashes; the new key ranges that C needs to store require computation of new Merkle trees; the same needs to be done for the exact same key ranges in other nodes besides C - which nodes?)
These are limitations that may occur when obtaining a medical history from a patient (Mark all that apply)

Write a function called num_unique that takes a sorted array of integers and an integer repesenting the length of that array as parameters and that returns the number of unique values in the array. The array is guaranteed to be in sorted order, which means that duplicates will be grouped together. For example, if a variable called list stores the following values: {5, 7, 7, 7, 8, 22, 22, 23, 31, 35, 35, 40, 40, 40, 41} then the following call num_unique(list, 15) should return 9 because this list has 9 unique values (5, 7, 8, 22, 23, 31, 35, 40 and 41). It is possible that the array might not have any duplicates. For example if list instead stored this sequence of values: {1, 2, 11, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 31, 34, 37, 40, 41} then a call on the function would return 15 because this list contains 15 different values. If passed an empty array, your function should return 0. Remember that you can assume that the values in the array appear in sorted (nondecreasing) order. You are not allowed to use a temporary array, string or struct to solve this problem and you are not allowed to call library functions to help you solve it.
It has been described in our LTPs that the acid chloride functional group is the most electrophilic functional group that we will study this semester.  It was shown that when an acid chloride is exposed to water it produces a hydrolysis reaction that results in the formation of HCl and an organic product.  a)  True or False.  It was suggested that this hydrolysis reaction is an example of a SN2 reaction.  (Type in T or F only)[TF]   b) Based on the above information and reaction type, what would be an accurate name of the organic product if acetyl chloride (the acid chloride of acetic acid) was exposed to ammonia, instead of water? [name]

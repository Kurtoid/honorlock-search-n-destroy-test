Which of the following is a major theme of Luke 3-9?
A patient has been admitted to the hospital with a reported symptom of being "unable to walk due to generalized muscle weakness". The initial tentative diagnosis is a motor neuropathy, but extensive nerve and electromyography recordings reveal normal neurological and muscle electrical properties. It is evident that the patient has muscle mass lower than normal. However, tests with nerve and muscle stimulation show normal maximal isometric force normalized to muscle mass (cross sectional area). Examination of gait confirm that the patient has trouble walking, and further tests show two important features: 1) decreased voluntary and electrically-stimulated submaximal isometric force normalized to muscle size/area, and 2) abnormal maximal isotonic properties (loss of peak power and maximal shortening velocity, both normalized to muscle size and length). Based on these observations, you can deduce the following:

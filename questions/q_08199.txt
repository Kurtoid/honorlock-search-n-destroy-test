Megging is measuring the electrical resistance between the rotating and stationery coils of electric motor to determine if sufficient moisture is present to cause a short circuit on startup.
THINK: A scientist finds what she thinks is a new species of rodent on a small Pacific island. However, some similar-looking rodents inhabit some nearby islands. She mates the new rodent with the nearby rodents and gets viable (living) but sterile offspring. Why?  [Hint:  2 categories of allopatric speciation are: Dispersal = which occurs when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area Vicariance = which occurs when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms]

Let the function f : N - R be defined recursively as follows:      Initial Condition:  f (0) = 1/3Recursive Part:  f (n + 1) = f (n) + 1/3, for n >= 0 Consider how to prove the following statement about this given function f using induction. f (n) = (n+1)/3, for all nonnegative integers n. Select the best response for each question below about how this proof by induction should be done.  Q1.  Which of the following would be a correct Basis step for this proof?  [Basis] A. For n = k, assume f(k) = (k+1)/3 for some integer k >= 0, so f(n) = (n+1)/3 for n = k. B. For n = 1, f(n) = f(1) = f(0)+1/3 = 2/3; also (n+1)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3, so f(n) = (n+1)/3 for n = 1. C. For n = 0, f(n) = f(0) = 1/3; also (n+1)/3 = (0+1)/3 = 1/3, so f(n) = (n+1)/3 for n = 0. D. For n = k+1, f(k+1) = (k+2)/3 when f(k) = (k+1)/3 for some integer k >= 0, so f(n) = (n+1)/3 for n = k+1.  Q2.  Which of the following would be a correct Inductive Hypothesis for this proof?  [InductiveHypothesis] A. Assume f(k) = (k+1)/3 for some integer k >= 0. B. Prove f(k) = (k+1)/3 for some integer k >= 0. C. Assume f(k+1) = (k+2)/3 when f(k) = (k+1)/3 for some integer k >= 0. D. Prove f(k) = (k+1)/3 for all integers k >= 0. Q3.  Which of the following would be a correct completion of the Inductive Step for this proof?  [InductiveStep] A. When the inductive hypothesis is true, f(k+1) = (k+2)/3 = (k+1)/3 + 1/3 = f(k) + 1/3, which confirms the recursive part of the definition. B. f(k+1) = f(k) + 1/3, which confirms the recursive part of the definition. C. When f(k+1) = (k+2)/3 = (k+1)/3 + 1/3; also f(k+1) = f(k) + 1/3, so f(k) = (k+1)/3, confirming the induction hypothesis. D. When the inductive hypothesis is true, f(k+1) = f(k) + 1/3 = (k+1)/3 + 1/3 = ((k+1)+1)/3 = (k+2)/3. Q4.  Which of the following would be a correct conclusion for this proof?  [Conclusion] A. By the principle of mathematical induction, f(k) = f(k+1) for all integers k >= 0. B. By the principle of mathematical induction, f(n) = (n+1)/3 for all integers n >= 0. C. By the principle of mathematical induction, f(n+1) = f(n) + 1/3 for all integers n >= 0. D. By the principle of mathematical induction, f(k) = (k+1)/3 implies f(k+1) = (k+2)/3 for all integers k >= 0.

Some types of colorblindness are sex-linked recessive traits carried on the X chromosome.  A woman who has normal vision, but who is a carrier for colorblindness, is pregnant with the child of a normal male (who is not colorblind). What is the chance that the child will either have or be a carrier of colorblindness regardless of gender?

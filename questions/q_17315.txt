A client is admitted to the unit post-operative. Vital signs are: blood pressure, 158/96 mm Hg; radial pulse 120 beats per minute and bounding, respirations, 24 breaths per minute and bilateral crackles to auscultation. What response does the nurse conclude that the client most likely is experiencing?
A distribution of point charges is placed on the coordinate system shown below. The axis is marked in meters. Assume the potential infinitely far from the origin is zero.   a) Calculate the electric potential due to the distribution of charges at point P, which is located at the origin. b) Find the electric potential at r= 8mi+4mj (8m, 4m) labeled as P' in the figure. c) A charge qc = -1.965x10-3 C is placed at the origin and is moved infinitely far away. What is the change in potential energy for qc. d) First of all, qc is removed from the origin. Then a charge of qd=8.65x10-7 C is placed at P'. What is the change in potential energy in moving this charge to the origin? part a) 3. Find the contribution to the electric potential from charge q1 at the origin. Write your answer in scientific notation, and enter the coefficient, rounding to 3 decimal places. Do not include units, and put a minus sign if negative.. V1 =         x107 V

You work for Hester & Co Solicitors, a small firm specialising in matrimonial finance and divorce proceedings. The firm recently acted for Mrs Gmerek following the breakdown of her three-year marriage to Mr Gmerek.  As part of this instruction, you obtained a financial settlement on behalf of Mrs Gmerek, which included a lump sum of PS50,000, in addition to having the former matrimonial home transferred into her sole name. There is a small mortgage outstanding on the property.  Mrs Gmerek has a full time job working for a local charity earning PS30,000 per annum.  She has an 8-year-old son from a previous relationship, who lives with her full time.  She has no contact with, or financial support, from the father. Mrs Gmerek has no investments or savings other than about PS2,000 that she paid into a cash ISA with Clackshire Building Society some years ago. She has previously given no thought to a pension (although has recently been enrolled in her employer's workplace scheme). She would like some investment advice as to what she should do with the PS50,000 she has received and in relation to her financial planning more generally. If Mrs Gmerek was a new client when you acted on the divorce, what should have been the first thing you asked to see before accepting the instruction and why?

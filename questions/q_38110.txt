1. [35 points] Weekly demand for a tablet at a Target Electronics store is normally distributed with mean of 40 units and standard deviation of 12 units. The store purchases the tablets for $280 each. There is a four-week lead time once an order is placed. The fixed ordering cost is $500 per order, and the annual inventory carrying rate is 30 percent. Unsatisfied demand can be backlogged into the next cycle. The estimated loss of goodwill cost is $40 per unit. Assume there are 52 weeks in a year. ***For this question, when you read "z" from the z-chart, you must always pick the upper z-value. You should not interpolate or pick the lower z-value.   I. [18 points] Determine the optimal order quantity and reorder level using the (q,r) policy model. II. [2 points] What is the safety stock for this item at the optimal solution? III. [6 points] What Type II service level is achieved using the optimal policy? IV. [9 points] What is the annual total expected cost associated with the optimal policy?     2. [40 points] A company has two assembly plants located in Dallas and Seattle with daily production rate of 60 and 80 units, respectively. Components A and B are used to make the final product at the assembly plants. One unit of component A and two units of component B are used in each product. Components A and B are purchased from suppliers located in Tampa and Savannah, respectively. Currently the components are shipped from the suppliers directly to the assembly plants. The trucks used have a capacity of 1000 units of either component, and the cost of $2700 per truckload. The inventory holding cost per component is $0.6 per day, and the transit time per route is 3 days. Assume that there are 360 days in a year.   I. [22 points] What are the annual total logistics (transportation, in-transit inventory, and on-site inventory) costs, if the optimal shipment quantities for direct deliveries are to be used? II. [18 points] The company is going to use trucks that have a capacity of 3000 units of either component with the cost of $6000 per truckload. What are the annual total logistics (transportation, in-transit inventory, and on-site inventory) costs, if the optimal shipment quantities for a milk-run delivery scheme are to be used? In other words, a truck picks up subassemblies first from Tampa then from Savannah and drops off first at Dallas and then at Seattle. Assume that it takes exactly 2 days to drive from Tampa to Savannah, exactly 4 days from Savannah to Dallas and exactly 3 days from Dallas to Seattle in calculating the in-transit costs associated with this system.     3. [25 points] Suppose you work as a supply chain analyst at a company with a stochastic demand during lead time. I. [10 points] Your boss has heard the term "crossdocking" in a conference, but he is not sure what it means. So, he asks you to explain what is crossdocking? What are the advantages and disadvantages of having a DC with crossdocking? How would you answer his questions? II. [10 points] The company has a manufacturing factory in China that ships their products to a central warehouse in Charlotte. The company has predetermined values for its order size and reordering level. Now the inventory manager asks you to choose a carrier among three available options. What would you do to determine the best carrier? What are the important factors and parameters of each carrier that are involved in your calculations? You should briefly explain your approach. III. [5 points] One of your colleagues claims that the expected cycle length of the (q,r) policy model is always equal to the cycle length of the basic EOQ model for any inventory system. Is this true? Why? (You should justify your answer by providing a proof or a counterexample.)

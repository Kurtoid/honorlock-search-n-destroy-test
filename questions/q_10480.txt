"Vaccines"  Source 2 "Vaccines." Gale Opposing Viewpoints Online Collection, Gale, 2020.

A vaccine is a biological product that helps humans or other animals develop immunities that protect them from one or more diseases. English doctor Edward Jenner (1749-1823) established the scientific basis for vaccination in 1796 after noticing that women who contracted cowpox from milking cows did not get smallpox even during major outbreaks in their communities. Jenner used material from their cowpox sores to manufacture a smallpox vaccine. Scientists continued to improve upon Jenner's smallpox vaccine, and vaccination eventually became mandatory in many states within the United States and in other countries worldwide. The World Health Organization's (WHO) first international smallpox vaccination program was started in 1959, and the WHO launched a global Intensified Eradication Program in 1967. The last known outbreak was in Somalia in 1977, and the WHO declared smallpox eliminated in 1980. Vaccines for various other diseases were also developed. Most vaccines, such as those for varicella (chickenpox), measles, meningitis, and polio, create long-term immunity with a single inoculation or a brief series of several shots. Others, such as flu vaccines, require periodic inoculations. Vaccinations have received wide support from US and global health-care organizations. The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted the need for ongoing investment in the development of vaccines. Despite consensus in the scientific community regarding the effectiveness of vaccines, some Americans remain skeptical about vaccine safety. Vaccines carry a minimal risk of injury, and all vaccines are tested, regulated, and regularly reviewed for safety. Despite these reassurances, some parents choose not to have their children vaccinated. Mandatory Vaccination The effectiveness of widespread inoculation in preventing, or in some cases eradicating, disease led to proposals that vaccinations be mandatory. Massachusetts passed the country's first vaccination law in 1809, which allowed local governments to require smallpox vaccination for residents over age twenty-one. In 1855 Massachusetts made smallpox vaccination mandatory for all children attending public schools. After several legal challenges, in 1905 the US Supreme Court ruled in Jacobson v. Massachusetts that states had the authority to mandate vaccinations in the interest of public health. In the twenty-first century, every state requires that children meet certain immunization requirements in order to attend public school, though the specific vaccination schedule varies from state to state. However, all states allow parents to obtain exemptions for their children for medical reasons. Nearly all states, with the exceptions of California, Mississippi, New York, and West Virginia, offer exemptions on religious or philosophical grounds. No US federal law requires vaccinations, though the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a federal agency under the US Department of Health and Human Services, issues vaccine recommendations and purchases half of all vaccines for distribution under state administration. Opposition to Mandatory Vaccines Opponents of mandatory vaccination contend that such legislation violates the Fourteenth Amendment, which maintains that the "liberty" of citizens cannot be impeded by state or federal law. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Jacobson v. Massachusetts that the Constitution does not guarantee unlimited "liberty," especially at the cost of the health and safety of others. Opponents of mandatory vaccination also cite the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of religion. While forty-six states and the District of Columbia allow religious exemptions from vaccines, guidelines for such exemptions vary in strictness from state to state. Critics of religious exemptions contend that they are based on personal choice, not religious canon. Parents who seek religious exemptions oppose vaccinations for different reasons according to the religion they practice. Muslims who do not consume pork products, for example, object to vaccines that contain gelatin derived from pigs. The Islamic Organization of Medical Sciences, however, has declared that the gelatin used in vaccines has been processed sufficiently to no longer be considered impure. Some Catholics object to certain vaccines because they were originally developed using human cell strains obtained from fetuses aborted in the 1960s, and the Catholic Church does not condone abortion. However, Catholic authorities have stated that because the vaccines come from descendant cell lines independent of the original fetal tissue, and because no alternatives are available, Catholics may receive the vaccines because they promote the greater good. Nevertheless, some members of the church remain staunch in their opposition. Fears that vaccines may injure children have caused further opposition to mandatory vaccinations. Resistance to vaccination increased significantly after the 1998 publication of a study by British former physician Andrew Wakefield (1957-) linking the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism. The study was quickly debunked, and the British medical journal Lancet, which had published it, formally retracted it in 2009. Though Wakefield's theory and other theories linking vaccination to autism and developmental disorders have been repeatedly proven false, many people continue to cite them as reasons for refusing vaccination for their children. Benefits of Vaccines Most parents in the United States choose to have their children vaccinated. Benefits include protecting children from certain preventable diseases and improving overall public health. The CDC recommends vaccinations against sixteen different diseases for children and adolescents and provides schedules with appropriate ages for the different inoculations. Vaccination programs have been so effective that most people have never personally witnessed the devastation childhood diseases routinely caused in previous generations. People may therefore resist vaccination because the threat of lifelong disability or death seems distant and unreal. But when enough people forgo vaccination, diseases once thought eradicated can resurface. In 2000, for example, the United States declared that measles had been eliminated nationwide. However, the disease has not been eradicated globally, and unvaccinated international travelers can expose residents to the disease. An outbreak of measles between December 2014 and February 2015 originated with unvaccinated visitors to California's Disneyland theme park. Cases spread over seven states and into Canada and Mexico. The outbreak led California to adopt one of the nation's toughest policies regarding vaccination exemptions. Another large measles resurgence occurred in 2019, with the CDC reporting 1,282 individual cases in thirty-one states, the highest number of cases since 1992. The majority of patients had never been vaccinated against measles, and clusters of cases formed in communities with larger numbers of unvaccinated people. Following the 2019 outbreak, New York passed legislation ending religious and philosophical exemptions to mandatory vaccination, and other states proposed laws to place stricter limits on such exemptions. However, lawmakers in some states, such as Arizona, continued to introduce bills to expand exemptions. Even after a disease has been eliminated within a geographic area, vaccinations are needed in order to maintain herd immunity. Herd immunity is the principle that having a high proportion of a community vaccinated protects those who cannot be vaccinated themselves. For example, some people, such as babies and people with compromised immune systems, cannot receive certain vaccinations. Though the exact threshold varies by disease, public health experts recommend a vaccination rate of over 90 percent for most contagious diseases to ensure herd immunity. If the vaccination rate drops significantly, the likelihood of an outbreak rises, putting the unvaccinated at risk.

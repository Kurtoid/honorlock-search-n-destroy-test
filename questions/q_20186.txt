E&T Books is a publisher of collectible maps that does all of its own map production - from map research and design to the printing and packaging of the maps. E&T is planning to create a new map to commemorate the upcoming 100th anniversary of Irish Independence. The publishing project will last 5 years after which E&T expects the demand for this map to have been exhausted and the project completed. The printing of this map will require a different printing process than E&T's other maps. As a result, E&T would need to purchase printing machinery and equipment for $1,125,000. Installation for the equipment will cost an additional $95,000. E&T will use straight line depreciation for this project. E&T has already paid for some preliminary design work for the map. This design work cost $25,250. E&T expects the following sales figures:                 Units Sold Year 1    20,000 Year 2    15,000 Year 3    10,000 Year 4    8,000 Year 5    5,000 The sales price of the map would be $75. Variable costs for the map will be $35. There will be additional annual fixed costs of $10,500. In addition, there will be costs for finalizing the map design of $7,500 before printing begins. The map project will require an initial injection of net working capital of $8,500 which will be returned at the end of the project. E&T's corporate tax rate is 33% and E&T has decided that the appropriate discount rate for this project is 14.5%. a. Determine the free cash flows of the project for time 0 to time 5. b. Calculate the NPV and IRR for this project. c. Should E&T undertake the printing of this map?

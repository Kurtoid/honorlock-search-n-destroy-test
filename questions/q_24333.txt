The hypothalamus (a part of your brain) detects fluctuations in temperature. The receptors on it are known as thermoreceptors. Skin also possesses thermoreceptors which can detect the temperature of the external environment. This information is relayed to the hypothalamus which can in turn transmit nerve pulses for corrective mechanisms to occur. If you are HOT, sweating (the water released absorbs heat from your body) and Vasodilation (blood vessels near the skin get bigger - skin may get red- this increases heat diffusion to the outside of your body) occurs. If you are COLD, Vasoconstriction (blood vessels near the skin get smaller- decreases heat loss), and Shivering (muscle movement creates heat) occurs. In extreme cold, blood flow to extremities decreases in order to protect internal organs

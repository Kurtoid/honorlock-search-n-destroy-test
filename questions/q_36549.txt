To complete this part of the exam, you will read the following instructions, type your name in the box, and then close Honorlock.

Click the Supplementary Timed Writing 5 link at the left. You have completed this timed writing previously, but I will be able to see your new attempts based upon the date you complete the training. Click the 3 minutes radio button and then click OK. To start the timed writing, you will simply begin entering the text shown on page SB-30 in your book. Most likely, you will not be able to enter the entire text in the 3-minute period. Do not worry, this is to be expected! The key is to type at a pace that you are consistently hitting the correct keys.  Take the timed writing two times. If you have a lot of errors the first time, slow down a little bit to help improve your accuracy. I will see the wpm and number of errors for each attempted timing as soon as you complete them, so you do not need to worry about submitting anything through our Canvas classroom.

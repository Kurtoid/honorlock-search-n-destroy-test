Write your name on the upper right corner of your first solution sheet, start each problem on a new sheet, and write clearly.  For full credit, show all work and box your final results. It is important to distinguish vectors from scalars. Grading will stop where an arrow is missing for a vector or an arrow is used for a scalar, with no credit given for the rest of the problem. 1. (10 points) A uniform cube of mass M and side a is placed on the xy plane as shown, with one edge on the x axis and the midpoint of the edge touching the origin.   (a) (6 points)     Find the inertia tensor of this cube about the origin.   (b) (4 points)     Find the principal axes that go through the origin and the principal moments  corresponding to them.  (You may draw the principal axes on a sketch of the cube, or express each by using a vector parallel to it -- for instance (1, 1, 0) if an axis lies on the xy plane and is tilted from the x axis by 45 degrees toward the y axis. The vector can be of any length.)       2. (10 points) Two carts of equal mass move without friction on a horizontal track that runs between two fixed walls. Each is attached to its adjacent wall by a spring, whose spring constant is k, and the carts are attached to each other by a third spring with spring constant 2k, as shown in the figure below. Find the frequencies of the normal modes of this system, as well as the ratio x2/x1 for each mode. Do this problem with no or minimum amount of calculation by invoking equivalent oscillators. You may use a conventional brute-force method, such as the one used by Taylor, with a penalty of 3 points.       3. (10 points)    A bead of mass m is threaded on a frictionless circular wire loop of mass 2m, as shown below. The hoop is suspended at point A and is free to swing in its own vertical plane. Find the normal frequencies of small oscillations, as well as the ratio

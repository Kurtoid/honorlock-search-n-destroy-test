Ok, let's get the hard stuff out of the way first... For the next few questions, consider the following.   You run a small eaterie that caters to fancy guests who like fancy foods and fancy ways of spelling things like "eatery."   You know that.... Your target market has substantial (99%) unaided awareness and completely understand what your offering is. However, because of how you spell things, people are turned off, and only 50 percent of the market actually likes you. From there, 40 percent want to go to your place and generally 35 percent actually do.   You're looking at a local advertisement purchase of about $600 in the Gainesville sun. According to the Gainesville Sun, 50% of the 10,000 that read the newspaper have the income and interest statistics that you're looking for (they are your potential customers)   From previous campaigns, about 10 percent of those customers will end up going to your web site. Of your site visitors, usually you can convert 50 percent into potential customers who visit your establishment. Generally speaking, 30 percent of those visitors will make a purchase ($5 profit), with 1/3 of those purchasers becoming a regular. Regulars usually come by monthly for 3 years.  You're also aware that some of this information may contradict itself. So now you have a few things to consider.

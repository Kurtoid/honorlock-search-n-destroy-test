PLGA microspheres (MS) were loaded with two different drugs, "Drug 1" and "Drug 2". The release profiles in vitro were obtained under sink conditions, shown in the figure below. Given that the PLGA MS characteristics were exactly the same in both cases, describe 2 possible differences in drug characteristics between "Drug 1" and "Drug 2" that would result in their respective release profiles.
Instructions: Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.        (1) Street skateboarding and vert skateboarding differ in several ways. (2) Street skateboarding takes place in outdoor public areas where there are staircases, benches, walls, and sidewalks. (3) In contrast, vert skateboarding usually takes place in skate parks with ramps or bowls. (4) Another major difference is the tricks performed in each type of skateboarding. (5) Street skaters use a style called the grind, which involves scraping their boards' axles against objects such as stairway handrails. (6) They also perform tricks that involve kicking the board to flip it into the air. (7) Vert skaters, on the other hand, use the steep walls of the ramps or bowls to pick up speed and gain "air time" at the edges. (8) While airborne, they perform different flips and spins. (9) To achieve these tricks, they use boards that are wider and flatter than street boards, which have upturned noses and tails to aid kicking.   Does this paragraph compare, contrast, or both?

The Freundlich isotherm for adsorption of xylene for activated carbon is as follows: q = 51.3 Cf 0.204 where,              q = mg of xylene adsorbed/g of carbon Cf = aqueous equilibrium concentration of xylene It is desired to reduce xylene concentration from 1200 mg/L to 10 mg/L. You are asked to design a batch system to treat a flow 1000 L/day of solution containing 1200 mg/L of xylene.  Amount of carbon (in Kg) required per day is most nearly: ( 1 m3 = 1000 L)

In corn, small pollen (sp) is recessive to normal pollen (sp+) and zebra necrotic (zn) is recessive to normal tissue (zn+). The genes that produce these phenotypes are closely linked on chromosome 10.   The cross below shows the genotypes of the two corn plants that were crossed (a dihybrid cross, the parents are heterozygous for both traits).      If no crossing over occurs between these two loci, what progeny are expected from this cross?

Use the following map to answer the questions that follow. Canvas will randomly select three of the five numbered station models. For each of these three station models selected by Canvas, indicate the observations requested. Label units! If you do not label units, you will not be able to get full credit. Each station model is worth 4 points. Note: You only need to answer this for the ONE station model per question listed below the map in BLUE. You will get three questions in a row that ask you for information for three different randomly-selected station numbers. If this is the first one you have seen, you will see two more stations in the next two questions. If this is the second one you have seen, you will see one more station in the next question. If this is the third one you have seen, this will be the last one; you do not have to answer this for every station labeled with a number.    Indicate the following observations for Location / Station Model 1: Temperature, Dew Point, Pressure, Wind Direction and Speed, and Cloud Cover Be sure to indicate which answer is which variable in your answer and don't forget to label units!

Long Answer: Write 6-8 sentences (one-two small paragraphs). This prompt has multiple questions in order to help you quickly brainstorm and address the issue from different angles. Answering each one will help you arrive at a complete answer quickly; however, some of the questions flow into each other, so focus on the complete idea as you write.   Both the "Woman Question" and the term "Angel in the House" were common phrases used and talked about in Victorian society, literature, and art.  First, what did Coventry Patmore mean by the term "Angel in the House" in his poem? (Remember, you weren't asked to read that poem, but it was mentioned because it was the first time this phrase was used.) What was he trying to say about his wife? In other words, explain the original/"positive" meaning of this phrase.  Second, build on your previous answer with the following question: Why was the term later viewed as problematic by other Victorians? What did this term start to mean to others? Why did this term develop a negative connotation? How does the phrase "Woman Question" demonstrate push-back against the "Angel in the House" ideal?  Make sure you address both parts of this question.

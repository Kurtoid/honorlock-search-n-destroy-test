In question 12 you had inoculated 2 cultures, 1 with Variant A and another with Variant B and counted the number of cells every 30 minutes, collecting the data at each time point for both variants. Now consider how the different generation times of Variant A and B would impact how the growth curves for these two variants would look. On your scratch paper, draw the bacterial growth curves that you would predict for each variant, evaluating how generation time affects the growth curves of these variants (make sure you comment on all 4 phases of the growth curve). You may draw both of the curves on a single graph or you may draw them separately. You may also choose to write your comments directly on your scratch paper or you may type them into the text box online, your choice. Please draw on your piece of scratch paper and then, using your phone, take a scan or picture of your answer.

Blood flow to a tissue remains relatively constant despite a reduction in arterial pressure (autoregulation). Which of the following would be expected to occur in response to the reduction in arterial pressure?
Problem 1 Questions 1-2 are for problem 1 Estimate the unit thermal resistance for a partition made up of 3/8 in. gypsum board on each side of 6 in lightweight aggregate blocks with vermiculite-filled cores. The air on both sides may be treated as still air. If the air temperature difference between the two sides is 7.2 F, find the heat transfer rate across the block.  The conductance of the gypsum board is 3.1 Btu/(hr-ft-F), the conductance of the block is 0.33 Btu/(hr-ft-F), and the unit resistance of the still air is 0.68 Btu/(hr-ft-F).

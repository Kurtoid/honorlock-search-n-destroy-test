Code-Writing, Part 2. Please read the code sample below carefully. You may assume all classes are properly imported.  Then read the instructions in the question which follows and write an appropriate code sample. Consider the following main method which calls WriteArray.  WriteArray writes each element of an array of any serializable type to a binary file. WriteArray takes in two parameters and returns a boolean.  The first parameter is the array to be written, the second parameter is the name of the file being written.  It returns true if the write process completes without exception and false otherwise.  WriteArray prints each element's string representation to the console immediately before writing it. public static void main(String[] args){    Integer[] theArray = {999, 18, 123456789, 555, 74, 1, 25, 12345, 9999, 9, 4875};    if (WriteArray(theArray, "outputFile.txt")){        System.out.println("Write successful");    }} As a result of a program run, the file outputFile.txt contains the binary representation of every Integer contained in theArray and the console output would be (assuming a successful write): 999181234567895557412512345999994875Write successful

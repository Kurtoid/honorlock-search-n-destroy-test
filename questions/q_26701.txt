The contract stipulates that Mary Frances will take all of Olivia Jade's final exams for her.  For every A received, Olivia Jade will pay Mary Frances $200.  For every B received, Olivia Jade will pay Mary Frances $100.  Mary Frances assures Olivia Jade that there is no possibility that she will receive any grade lower than a B. Their college requires that all students present a valid driver's license in order to take their exams.  On the day of Olivia Jade's Ethics and Morals exam, Mary Frances shows Olivia Jade's license.

Use the following information to answer the following questions.The dune-burrowing spider Seothyra species lives in the Namib Desert on the southwestern coast of Africa. These spiders build silk-lined burrows with a sticky silk mat at the entrance to trap insect prey. While foraging during the day, the spider remains concealed in its burrow and shielded from direct sunlight when prey are not present. When insect prey become entangled in the sticky silk mat, the spider will run out of its burrow and capture the prey insects.During the day, environmental temperatures vary from 17 to 73degC (63-164degF). If a spider is forced to remain outside of its burrow, it shows signs of thermal stress at 49degC. When spiders are unrestrained, they spend more time waiting inside their burrows to keep their internal temperatures below 49degC, even when surface temperatures are above 65degC. In addition, spiders respond more quickly to prey stimuli during the hottest times of the day and capture prey in significantly less time when surface temperatures are above 49degC. The captured arthropods (prey) tend to succumb more quickly to hot surface temperatures; they are more lethargic and struggle less when captured at the high temperature ranges.When foraging spiders are too hot, they retreat into their burrows. What type of feedback system does this indicate?

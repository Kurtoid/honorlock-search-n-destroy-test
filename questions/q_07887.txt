A Caucasian couple is concerned that their unborn baby will have cystic fibrosis (CF). They already have a 4-year-old daughter. A dot blot analysis is performed to genotype the family for the F508 deletion in the CFTR gene. Probes complementary to the region spanning the F508del and to the wild type (WT) sequence in that region (WT) are spotted onto a membrane.

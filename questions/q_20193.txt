22. It has been reported that the purple flower color in one species of the Japanese morning glory maybe caused by dominant alleles at either one of two separate gene pairs, e.g., A-bb or aaB-. When dominant alleles are present at both gene pairs (A-B-), the color of the flower is blue, and when both are homozygous recessive (aabb), the color is scarlet.    If AAbb was crossed with aaBB the flower color would be blue. If these blue flowers (F1) were crossed, what would be the phenotype and genotype of the F2? If the F1 were crossed to either of the parents, what would be the phenotype and genotype of the F2?

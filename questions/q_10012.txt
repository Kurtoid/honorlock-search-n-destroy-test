In wolves, gray coat color (G) is dominant to black (g) and brown eyes (B) are dominant to blue (b). The genes that control these traits are located on different chromosomes. The alpha male of the pack has the dominant phenotype for both traits and is heterozygous for both traits. The alpha female has brown eyes and a black coat; she is heterozygous for eye color. Which option represents gametes that would be made by the alpha female?

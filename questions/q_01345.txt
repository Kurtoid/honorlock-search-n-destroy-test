Each block in a direct-mapped write-back cache with a snooping write-invalidate, cache coherence protocol has 3 states: invalid, shared, and exclusive.  When the source is processor, it means the request (cache result) came from the current processor (cache).  When the source is bus, it means that the request came from another processor (cache).  A read miss or write miss indicates that the cache block was accessed, but the correct memory block was not in the processor's cache.      Case Source Current State Request Action New State   1 processor invalid read miss place read miss on bus    2 processor invalid write miss place write miss on bus    3 processor shared read hit     4 processor shared read miss place read miss on bus    5 processor shared write hit place invalidate on bus    6 processor shared write miss place write miss on bus    7 processor exclusive read hit     8 processor exclusive write hit     9 processor exclusive read miss write back block    10 processor exclusive write miss write back block    11 bus shared read miss     12 bus shared write hit     13 bus shared write miss     14 bus exclusive read miss write back block    15 bus exclusive write miss write back block      Indicate the cache state transitions based on the information in the table above.  In other words, choose one of the three states (invalid, shared, or exclusive) that will be the new state of the processor's cache block for each case in the table.  You should do this by cutting and pasting the lines below and fill in an I (invalid), S (shared), or E (exclusive) to represent the new state for each case. 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.
According to The World Bank, only 9% of the population of Uganda had access to electricity as of 2009. Suppose we randomly sample 163 people in Uganda.

Recall that the digestive processes in the stomach occurs in three phases. In the third phase CCK and Secretin inhibit the stomach, but stimulate the liver and pancreas to release their products. Based on this information and what you know about the physiology and anatomy of the digestive system and accessory organs answer the following questions:   A. Explain why the stomach is inhibited, but the liver and pancreas are stimulated in this third stage.   B. Specify the function of the exocrine secretions released from the pancreas and indicate where these secretions enter into the gastrointestinal track.

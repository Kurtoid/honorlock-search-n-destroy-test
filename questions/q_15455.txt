A frictional force between the crate and the floor points to the left, opposite the motion. a)  Use the work and energy equation to find the total work done by all non-conservative forces together. b)  Given the frictional force between the crate and the floor is fk = 40 N, find the work done by the plumber (by force F) to the box.

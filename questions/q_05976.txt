If the "system" is the girl plus the basketball, what is the velocity of the girl/basketball system after she catches the ball, assuming there is no friction between the skates and the floor.          BEFORE   AFTER     Ball   m = 10 kg v = 16 m/s   m = 10 kg v = ?     Girl   m = 30 kg v =  0 m/s   m = 30 kg v = ?
This law forced people into helping catch alleged runaway slaves; refusal to do so was a federal crime.  Accused African Americans had no right to a jury trial or lawyer and a federally appointed commissioner (not the court system) would be responsible for determining their status.

The compressive strength of concrete is normally distributed.  A random sample of four concrete specimens yields 1876 psi, 1864 psi, 1888 psi and 1899 psi.    This question is part of a quiz or exam given at Arizona State University, copywritten by Dr. L. Chattin.  It may not be reproduced, posted or distributed without permission of Arizona State University and L. Chattin. Determine the upper bound of a 2-sided 99% confidence interval on the population mean concrete strength.  Select the answer closest to yours.
Millennials number around 83 million and represent a huge business opportunity in the United States. Which of the following is a defining feature of millennials?
The following fault tree should be used as a basis for all answers to this question:   Determine the probabilities for intermediate events F1, F2, F3, F21 and F22. (Use rare event approximation.)  P(F21) = [Answer211] P(F22) = [Answer212] P(F2) = [Answer213] P(F1) = [Answer214] P(F3) = [Answer215]   Use Boolean algebra to develop a complete expression for the fault tree in terms of basic events, only. Expression = [Answer22]   Simplify the Boolean expression to identify the minimal cut sets.  Expression = [Answer23]   How many OR and AND gates does the Boolean equivalent fault tree include, based on the minimal cut sets? OR gates = [Answer241] AND gates = [Answer242]   Calculate the top event probability, based on the minimal cut sets.  P(TE) = [Answer25]   Determine the importance of the minimal cut sets and rank them. (Use the P(TE) value in your Ik value calculations.) Cut Set #1 event(s) = [Answer2611]; Pk-value = [Answer2612]; Ik-value = [Answer2613]; Rank = [Answer2614] Cut Set #2 event(s) = [Answer2621]; Pk-value = [Answer2622]; Ik-value = [Answer2623]; Rank = [Answer2624] Cut Set #3 event(s) = [Answer2631]; Pk-value = [Answer2632]; Ik-value = [Answer2633]; Rank = [Answer2634]   Are there more than three cut sets that need to be analyzed for ranking? [Answer27]   Do the importance values for the initiators identified in the cut sets differ from the cut set importance values, themselves? [Answer28]

An 18 inch diameter (circular cross-section) culvert 50 ft in length and 4% slope is to be placed under a farm road to carry an estimated peak runoff of 15 cfs. The invert elevation of the pipe inlet is 100 ft and the maximum tail-water elevation is 101 feet. The entrance is square and corrugated metal pipe (CMP) is to be installed. Assume that ponding of water above the culvert has no effect on runoff. To what elevation would the road have to be built so that this flow condition would not overtop the road?

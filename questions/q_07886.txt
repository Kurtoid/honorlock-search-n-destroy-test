*** For all B problems below, you MUST provide your work on the template or blank paper and upload as a single file after you have finished the exam. *** Select a one 10-point B question (that is, one of B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, or B6) to skip -- it will not be graded.  Make your choice at the bottom of the question. The remaining seven B problems that you do answer will total 76 points. B1. (10 points). You bought a share of stock one year ago for $75 and sold it today for $81.50. The stock paid a $2.25 dividend today. If the inflation rate over the last year was 1.4%, what real rate of return did you earn on your stock investment? B2. (10 points) If a stock investment had realized total returns of 18%, 12.5%, and 14.5% over the last three years, what is the 95% prediction interval for next year's return? B3. (10 points) You own 200 shares of stock A, currently priced at $80 per share, and 500 shares of stock B, currently priced at $25 per share. The beta of stock A is 1.14 and the beta of stock B is 1.88. The risk-free interest rate is 4% and the expected return on the market portfolio is 10%. What is the expected return of your portfolio? B4. (10 points) Stock A has an expected return of 15% and volatility of 20%, while stock B has an expected return of 18.5% and volatility of 30%. If the correlation of returns between the two stocks is 0.78, what is the volatility (i.e., standard deviation of returns) for a portfolio that has 67% invested in stock A and 33% in stock B? B5. (10 points) The risk-free interest rate is 4%. Stock A has a beta of 1.20 and an expected return of 14.2%. Suppose you create a portfolio by combining stock A with a risk-free asset (e.g., Treasury bills) and the resulting portfolio has a beta of 0.90. a. (5 points) What proportion of your portfolio is invested in stock A? b. (5 points) What is the expected return of your portfolio? B6. (10 points) You are evaluating a project that costs $250M and is expected to provide total cash inflows of $40M per year over the next 10 years (end-of-period cash flows). a. If your required return is 15%, what is the MIRR of the project? b. Would you Accept or Reject based on MIRR? (select one) B7. (12 points) You are evaluating a mining project that costs $2.5B to undertake and is expected to generate cash inflows of $0.75B per year for the next 15 years (i.e., end-of-year payments starting at time 1). However, to get those inflows, you will also need to spend $3.0B ten years from now and there is a cost of $5.5B at the end of the project life to restore the land. If your required return is 10%, what is the NPV of the mining project?   B8. (14 points) Your firm is choosing between two potential investment projects of similar risk. The required return on either investment is 12% and you believe that whichever project you choose, you will replace it with similar investments into the indefinite future. Project A has a five-year life, an estimated NPV of $6,350, and EAA of $1,762 per year. Project B has an eight-year life and costs $500,000. It is expected to generate cash flows of 98,200 per year for the eight-year life, plus an additional 48,750 at the end of the final year. a. (6 points) What is the NPV of project B? b. (6 points) What is the equivalent annual annuity (EAA) of project B? c. (2 points) Which project would you choose, and WHY?   Select one of the following 10-point B problems to indicate you are choosing to skip it.  That question will not be graded.

Storytellers across all cultures, whether they use the printed word or film format, become a part of a larger dialogue regarding social, cultural, and political values. In a handwritten essay, analyze how your assigned novel engages with some of the concerns of, and inherent questions posited by, postcolonial theorists today. How and why does the text engage with and respond to specific concerns of postcolonialism? Be sure to keep in mind that you must demonstrate a clear understanding of postcolonialism, contemporary world literature, and literary analysis. Remember, just because a story setting is a colonial time period does not disqualify a text from engaging with postcolonialism. Review your notes from our class conversations during the last three weeks of the semester.  No works cited page is required, but you do need evidence to support your claims in essay, but you absolutely must identify the author and title in your introduction. Use Paragraphs. The five paragraph strategy is appropriate for timed essays (exam essays). Use this to your advantage. Introductions and Conclusions must have four sentences minimum. Body paragraphs must have five sentences minimum. Write 500-750 words. The minimum requirement of 500 words is set by Blinn. I have never had a student NOT hit 500 words, IF they plan an outline for a five paragraph essay. Be organized. You can use an index card to write an outline or notes on. It must be a handwritten card, and can only contain outlined ideas. Do not pre-write an essay! Use evidence. If you have direct quotes from the novel, you can write them on your index card (hint: keep them short!) but summary and paraphrasing is also acceptable. You are typing this into a text box-- you do not need to double space, but DO leave a space between paragraphs AND DO indent for new paragraphs.

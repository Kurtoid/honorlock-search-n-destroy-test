Demand for each style during the season is Normally distributed with a mean of 2000 and a standard deviation of 800. The retailer pays $100 per unit and plans to sell them at the retail price of $175 per unit. Any units not sold during the season can be sold on the secondary market for $70 per unit.  The styles are delivered by ocean container at a cost of $4,000 per container and the retailer is responsible for this transportation cost.  a. Ignoring the transportation costs, how many units of each style 1 and how many units of style 2 should the retailer order to maximize expected profits?

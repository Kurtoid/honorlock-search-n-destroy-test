[15 points] At a fixed location of a highway, one observes that 25% of the vehicles are trucks and 75% are cars. At the same location, 2,500 vehicles (trucks and cars) are observed within an hour. The trucks travel at 40 mph and the cars at 60 mph.  At a certain point in time, variable speed limit (VSL) control is turned on, requiring all vehicles in the highway section to reduce their speed to 35 mph simultaneously, such that the vehicle spacing (and thus the density) for each vehicle type/class remains constant after the activation of the VSL control.  No vehicles enter or exit the subject highway section.  Determine   (a) [5 points] the density of vehicles before the VSL activation (b) [5 points] the percent of each vehicle type seen by a stationary observer after the VSL activation (c) [5 points] the percent of each vehicle type seen on an aerial photograph after the VSL activation

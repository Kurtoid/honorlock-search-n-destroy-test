A bank has $[zerocat] million in assets in the 0 percent risk-weight category. It has $[twentycat] million in assets in the 20 percent risk-weight category. It has $[fiftycat] million in assets in the 50 percent risk-weight category and has $[hundredcat] million in assets in the 100 percent risk-weight category. This bank has $[tier1] million in Tier 1 capital and $[tier2] million in Tier 2 capital. What is this bank's ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets? Type your answer as percentage and not as decimal (i.e. 5.2 and not 0.052). Round to the nearest two decimals if needed. Do not type the % symbol.
12. A hospital division consists of three large nursing units, A, B, and C. The registered nurses (RN's) in units A, B, and C earn $30, $27, and $24 per hour, respectively. Overtime is paid at time-and-a-half. There is also the possibility of assigning some of the hours from nurses assigned to unit A to meet requirements in units B and C. The division wants to develop a 4-month staffing plan. The minimum number of labor hours required in each unit each month are:     January February March April   Unit A 2700 3300 2700 2600   Unit B 2400 2800 2900 2600   Unit C 2100 2200 2500 2800    The number of regular-time hours allocated for any individual unit should be the same in each of the 4 months (i.e., regular-time hours in unit A might be more or less than units B or C, however the number of regular-time hours assigned for A in January must be the same number in A for Feb, March, etc.). Overtime can be used as needed in any unit, but cannot exceed 18% of regular-time hours in any month. In any given month, up to 15% of the total number of regular-time plus overtime hours available from nurses assigned to unit A can be used to meet nursing requirements in units B and/or C. Develop a linear programming formulation that will determine the assignment of regular-time and overtime nursing hours to each nursing unit each month. The objective of the model is to minimize total staffing costs for the division during the 4-month period. Constraints of the model should guarantee that nursing hours meet or exceed the labor hours required in each unit each month, and that the overtime and substitution (i.e., using hours assigned to A to meet requirements in B and/or C) conditions are satisfied.

State the correct order of ACTION POTENTIAL :   1 Resting potential - the resting, no stimulus yet 2. Threshold - when the depolarization reaches about -55 mV a neuron will fire an action potential 3. Stimulus - a disturbance causes a few sodium channels in a small portion of the membrane to open 4. Hyperpolarization / refractory period - the K gate closes. When the membrane potential returns to the resting value, the potassium channels shut down and potassium ions can no longer leave the cell. 5. Resting state - the membrane potential slightly overshoots the resting potential, which is corrected by the sodium-potassium pump, which restores the normal ion balance across the membrane 6. Depolarization - Sodium ions enter the cell through the open sodium channels. The positive charge that they carry makes the inside of the cell slightly less negative 7. Repolarization - K gate opens. The developing positive membrane potential causes potassium channels to open.

Below is a summary of a nursing study. Read the summary and then answer the factual questions that follow.  A team of researchers conducted a two-year study to test the hypothesis that breastfeeding outcome at 8 weeks postpartum is affected by the quality of mother-infant interactions during the first few days postpartum. Married women aged 21 to 35 who were in the third trimester of their first pregnancies and who had expressed a desire to breastfeed their infants for at least 12 weeks were considered eligible for the study.  A sample of 125 pregnant women from Atlanta who met the study criteria were recruited into the study.  The quality of mother-infant interactions was measured between 48 and 96 hours postpartum in the subjects' homes, using a tool called the Nursing Child Assessment Feeding Scale (NCAFS). The NCAFS consists of six sets of items, and each set lists a series of caregiver and/or infant behaviors that the researchers watched for and recorded during routine feedings. For example, one set measures the degree to which the mother fosters her child's social-emotional growth.  Scores from the six sets are summed for a total score that can range from 1 to 76, with higher scores reflecting higher quality interactions.  Breastfeeding outcome (breastfeeding one or more times a day versus not breastfeeding at all) was assessed 8 weeks later. Data for the study were collected over a 14-month period.  The statistical findings indicated that women who had higher scores on the NCAFS scale postpartum were more likely than women with lower scores to continue to breastfeed at 8 weeks after delivery.

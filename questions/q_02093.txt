A compound is known to have a free carboxyl group with a pKa of 2.0 and one other ionizable group with a pKa between 5 and 7. To 500 mL of a 0.2 M solution of this compound at pH 3.0 was added 20 mL of a solution of 2.0 M potassium hydroxide (strong base that completely dissociates). The pH changed to 6.4. The pKa of the second ionizable group is:

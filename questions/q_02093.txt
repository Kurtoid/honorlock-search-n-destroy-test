A 75-year-old female presents to the emergency department with vomiting, high-grade fever, and left flank pain of 2 days duration. Prior to that, the patient started having dysuria a week ago and her primary care doctor started her on ciprofloxacin. The dysuria did not improve. Patient has a history of CHF , and CAD s/p CABG 5 years ago. Home medications include: aspirin, carvedilol, lisinopril, ciprofloxacin., furosemide, and spironolactone. Initial labs--WBC: 18,000 with 15% bands, Hg: 12, HCT: 36, platelets: 250,000, Na: 131, K: 3.7, Cl: 99, HCO3: 28, BUN: 80, Cr: 2.8 (last Cr was 0.7 ten days ago), glucose: 95, Ca: 8.0, BNP: 300, and lactic acid: 3.0 (normal is up to 2.0). Urinalysis showed elevated white blood cells, trace protein and blood, bacteriuria, and many hyaline casts. Urine sodium was 8 mmol/L. FeNa was

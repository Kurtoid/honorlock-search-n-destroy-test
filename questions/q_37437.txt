True/False.  Enter T or F for statement.  (Do not enter the words "true" or "false".  Just the letter T or F) [1] Propagating electromagnetic waves are governed by the fully static Maxwell's equations. [2] Transmission line effects must be considered when an electrical conductor is longer than 1 meter. [3] A transmission line helps to guide electromagnetic wave energy in a certain direction, whereas in free space, electromagnetic wave energy can be distributed in three dimensions. [5] The characteristic impedance Z0 of a transmission line is largely attributed to the resistance of the copper conductors. [7] Cellular networks use square "cells" to provide radio coverage across a region of land. [8] One advantage of a half-wave dipole antenna is that the current and voltage are constant along the length of the antenna segments. [9] The radiation pattern of an antenna quantifies the potential health effects during operation. [10] Part 15 of the FCC regulations describes how one can operate a radio transmitter (such as a WiFi router) without requiring a license from the government.

At the beginning of your answer, identify the genre and general time period of each author, by century (were they 16th, 17th, 18th, or 19th?) -1 for each missing or incorrect century or genre.  Note: Your answer must draw from the assigned readings in the course. You're being asked about the author's assigned writing, NOT about their lives.   Essay Questions: Choose 1 of the following 2 options to write about.   OPTION 1 Discuss the work of Las Casas and Rowlandson. Note: you're not being asked to discuss the author's biography. To receive credit,  answer with reference to their assigned writing from this class. First, discuss the rhetoric employed by Casas: in his writing, how did he attempt to convince his audience that the exploitation of indigenous Americans should be ended? Cite as many examples as you can remember, always noting the effect these examples had on his writing. What other rhetorical strategies did he employ? Then, compare his work with the Narrative of Mary Rowlandson. What were their differing attitudes towards Indigenous Americans? How did this manifest in their language?  Remember: extra credit may be offered to students who write an especially specific, thoughtful, well-constructed essay.                                                                                                                                                                                              OPTION 2 OR (if you'd prefer another option): Compare Anne Bradstreet's literary work to the work of Edward Taylor. Do you see any similarities between the literary works of these writers? What are the key differences?  Be sure to note the dominant subject matter of their work. In your discussion, support your points with reference to at least 2 works by Bradstreet;   1 work by Taylor. (If you forget the name of a specific work, you can describe it.)     Remember: extra credit may be offered to students who write an especially specific, thoughtful, well-constructed essay.

OPTIONAL ESSAY BONUS (D2L Question 83):  If you want to do a bonus, you may CHOOSE to answer EITHER this essay bonus or the bonus problem from D2L Question 81. You may NOT answer both.   This bonus has two parts to it.  Answer both parts, labeling each part (a) or (b).

Mutations are necessary for evolution to work.   If both these statements are true, how is it possible for all the diversity of life we see today to have been produced by evolutionary processes?   b) Considering what has been discussed in class, explain clearly how evolution explains both the unity and the  diversity of life.

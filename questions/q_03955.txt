PART ONE Short Answer Questions (5 pts each = 25 points)   Please choose five out of the following six questions to answer.  Your answer to each question may not exceed 75 words.   A group of Green County Sheriff's deputies sue the County, asking the court to issue an injunction that will compel the County to recognize a newly formed labor union that would represent the deputies.   The County moves for summary judgment.  It argues that it cannot legally recognize such a union, because a state statute forbids the members of "any town, city, or state law enforcement agency" from forming a labor union.   In their response brief, the deputies argue that, as employees of the Green County Sheriff's Office, they are not prohibited from unionizing by this statute, because the Sheriff's Office is a county law enforcement agency, and the statute only prohibits unionizing by a "town," "city," or "state" agency.     Q: First, what canon of statutory interpretation does the argument in the deputies' brief reflect?  And second, if you were the County's lawyer, what is an argument you might make in reply - to advocate to the court that the canon in question should not apply here?

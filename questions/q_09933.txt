Regarding hemostasis:  Hemostasis has three phases: vascular phase, platelet phase and coagulation phase Hemostasis is a complex cascade or chain reaction in which many things happen at once. During the vascular phase, endothelial cells contract and release endothelins During the platelet phase, platelets release a variety of chemicals that promote aggregation, vascular spam, clotting and vessel repair The extrinsic pathway, the common pathway and the intrinsic pathway are part of the coagulation phase At the end of the common pathway, fibrinogen is converted to fibrin
This question has two parts. (1) Replace the system acting on the place by an equivalent force-couple at point B.  Express the force portion as a single vector acting at an angle.  You may skip drawing the FBD but you must include all other diagrams and notation required by solving problems of this type. (2) Replace the force-couple you found in part (1) with an equivalent force and its location that acts along AB Include all required diagrams for this problem type in your solution. Place your final answer(s) in a box. You do not have to use the homework format (Problem/Find/Solution, explanations, ruler) but you must use proper notation.

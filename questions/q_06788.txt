Use the information for the question(s) below.Consider two firms, Firm X and Firm Y, that have identical assets that generate identical cash flows. Firm Y is an all-equity firm, with 1 million shares outstanding that trade for a price of $24 per share. Firm X has 2 million shares outstanding and $12 million in debt at an interest rate of 5%. Assume that MM's perfect capital markets conditions are met and that you can borrow and lend at the same 5% rate as Firm X. You have $5000 of your own money to invest and you plan on buying Firm Y stock. Using homemade leverage, how much do you need to borrow in your margin account so that the payoff of your margined purchase of Firm Y stock will be the same as a $5,000 investment in Firm X stock?

Rules  Operational considerations    1 The oxidation number of an atom in an elemental substance is zero.    2 The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to the ion's charge.    3 Oxidation number for common elements H, O , and halogens:H: +1 when combined with nonmetals; -1 when combined with metals.O: -2 in most compounds; Sometimes -1 (so-called peroxides, O22-); Very rarely -  1/2  (so-called superoxides, O2-); Positive values when combined with F (values vary).Halogens: -1 for F always; -1 for other halogens except when combined with oxygen or other halogens (positive oxidation numbers in these cases, varying values).    4 The sum of the oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals the charge on the molecule or ion.

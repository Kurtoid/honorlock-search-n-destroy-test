Here is a table of processes and their associated arrival and running times.    Show the scheduling order for these processes under 3 policies:  (1) First Come First Serve (FCFS),  (2) Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF),  (3) Round-Robin (RR) with time slice quantum = 1.  Q1. Assume that context switch overhead is 0 and that new RR processes are added to the head of the queue and new FCFS processes are added to the tail of the queue. Please Fill in the running Process number only (for example, "P1",  you should only input 1). FCFS is given to demonstrate how you will need to answer this question.

Note that wait time is the total time spent waiting in queue (all the time in which the task is not running). Fill in the waiting time, number only (for example, 0, 1 or 2).

43.  An auditor desired to test credit approval on 10,000 sales invoices processed during the year. The auditor designed a statistical sample that would provide 5% risk of assessing control risk too low (95% confidence) that not more than 7% of the sales invoices lacked approval. The auditor estimated from previous experience that about 3% of the sales invoices lacked approval. A sample of 100 invoices was examined and 5 of them were lacking approval. The auditor then determined the achieved upper precision limit to be 8%. In the evaluation of this sample, the auditor decided to increase the level of the preliminary assessment of control risk because the

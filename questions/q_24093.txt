WORKOUT PROBLEM starts here: (Nothing to submit here, just read the problem. Some of the homework format/layout is already provided)    Two blocks connected by a rope passing over an ideal pulley rest on frictionless ramps. Ignore air resistance. Block 1 has a mass of 100 kg and block 2 has a mass of 50.0 kg. The angles are th = 30.0deg and a = 53.1deg. The system is released from rest.    Given: Connected blocks on frictionless ramps.Find:  Draw a FBD clearly and neatly for block 1. Draw a FBD clearly and neatly for block 2. Determine the accelerations of the blocks.

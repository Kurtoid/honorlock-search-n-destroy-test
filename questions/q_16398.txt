Fills any extra space with the null character.   strchr(str1, char1) returns a pointer to the first occurrence of char1 in str1.   strrchr(str1, char1) returns a pointer to the last occurrence of char1 in str1.   strstr(str1, str2) returns a pointer to the first occurrence of str2 in str1.   strlen(str1) Returns the length of string str1.   strtok(str1, del) Splits string into tokens on any character in delimiter string. One split per call.   strcmp(str1, str2) If str1 and str2 are equal returns 0. If str1 is alphabetically before str2 or a substring of str2 returns a negative number. Otherwise returns a positive number.   strncmp(str1, str2) Works like strcmp but only compares up to the first n characters of both strings         Character Function Description   tolower(ch1) Returns ch1 in lowercase   toupper(ch1) Returns ch1 in uppercase   isalnum(ch1) Returns true if ch1 is alphanumeric   isalpha(ch1) Returns true if ch1 is alphabetic   isdigit(ch1)  Returns true if ch1 is a decimal digit   islower(ch1) Returns true if ch1 is a lowercase letter   ispunct(ch1) Returns true if ch1 is a punctuation character   isspace(ch1) Returns true if ch1 is white-space   isupper(ch1) Returns true if ch1 is an uppercase letter    Creating an array: type name[size] = {value, value, ..., value};   Memory: variable = (type*) malloc(size); variable = (type*) calloc(count, size); free(pointer);   Reading a file: FILE* file = fopen(name, "r"); type variable; while (fscanf(file, "placeholder", &variable) != EOF) {      // do something with variable } Placeholder for reading a whole line: "%[^n]n"   Splitting a string: First call: char* name = strtok(original_string, delimiter) Following calls: char* name = strtok(NULL, delimiter)   Reading a number from a string: atoi(string) - returns an int with the value stored in the passed in string atof(string) - returns an double with the value stored in the passed in string   Structs typedef struct typename { // declaring a struct type     type name;     type name;     ...     type name;  // fields } typename;     expression description    a & b AND ; all bits that are set to 1 in both a and b    a | b OR ; all bits that are set to 1 in a or in b or both    a ^ b XOR ; all bits that are set to 1 in a or in b but not in both    ~a NOT ; the "ones complement" of the bits of a  (all bits flipped)    a > n RIGHT SHIFT ; moves all digits to the right by n places;    same as dividing  a / 2n

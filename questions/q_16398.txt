This question is worth 10 points and will be graded separately. Score will be added to your Exam. For this part of the exam, you will submit your diagrams on a separate sheet of blank paper to the Exam 1 Part 2 link on Blackboard AFTER you finish your test. Please follow these steps exactly to receive credit: Complete all the drawings while connected to Respondus LockDown Browser. When your drawing is complete be sure to put your name on the front of the drawing. After disconnecting from the exam, you have 30 minutes to submit all the drawings to the "Exam 1 Part 2" assignment on the "Exams" link. You can submit the file as a pdf or a jpeg file.  The questions will only be shown in the actual exam, so it is important to complete the drawing before submitting/disconnecting from your exam. Use a separate sheet of paper to do these drawings and a pen or pencil.  Question: The following question is inspired on the REAL "Beauty" and the "Beast" story, which is far from Disney's happy ever after. Petrus Gonzales, who suffered form congenital generalized hypertrichosis, was captured as a boy and became the property of Henry II, King of France in 1547. He was not considered human but was given an education. Later in life he was forced to marry an unknowingly, and beautiful, Lady Catherine, who met him literally at the altar. The purpose of this marriage was to obtain offspring who could be offered as gifts to other kingdoms. Again, not so very fairy tale.The are several types of congenital generalized hypertrichosis, among those, X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive. For this question you will create two family pedigrees that will expand three generations starting with Petrus and Catherine, who we will consider normal/non-carrier. You will need to use the appropriate symbols and connections in the pedigree chart as well as to write the corresponding genotypes in order to get full credit. Each pedigree (5 points each) should reflect the trait inheritance in all the generations. For the first pedigree assume that Petrus has the X-linked dominant hypertrichosis and for the second pedigree assume he has the X-linked recessive type. Label them properly. We will study the first three children of Petrus and Catherine, two girls and a boy. The eldest girl married a "normal/non-carrier" man and had four children. In your pedigree charts, for this third generation, each of the four children will represent a genotype that you can obtain by doing a Punnet square with the parents information. Each family member in the pedigree must have their genotype next to its respective symbol.

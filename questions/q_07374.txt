3. ii) How does the electric field within a parallel-plate capacitor relate to the area A of the plate and charge q in one of the plates? (Use Gauss's law) ii) Determine the potential difference between the plates if the separation between them is d and show the correlation between its capacitance and physical dimensions. iii) How does the correlation change if an insulator of dielectric constant k is inserted between the plates? iv) With a diagram, briefly discuss how a capacitive proximity sensor works.

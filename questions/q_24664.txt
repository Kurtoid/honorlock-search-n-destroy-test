Lawyer represents Plaintiff in a wrongful death action against Defendant. Defendant is accused of negligently killing Plaintiff's son, a local honor student, while Defendant was driving drunk. The case has generated some publicity in the local media, and is approaching trial. Defendant's lawyer recently was interviewed by a local news station about the case. During the interview, Defendant's lawyer said, "We of course all mourn the loss of this young man. Even if he was no model citizen and had personal problems involving drug abuse and cheating at school, no one minimizes the loss." Upset at these statements about inadmissible facts, Lawyer the next day called a press conference and said, "This young man before his death set an example for our youth to follow. Any problems he had were the minor and private indiscretions of youth with no relevance to this case. The loss here is the loss of an outstanding young man who was killed by a driver who was not only drunk, but as tests will show was also high on narcotics." Is Lawyer subject to discipline?

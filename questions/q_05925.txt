Stephen was in a restaurant in Toronto with his friends.  A group of American tourists came in and one of Stephen's friends decided to have some fun.  He had a toy badge in his pocket that he had bought for his six-year old brother to use as part of a Halloween costume.  He gave Stephen the badge and convinced him that it would be hilarious to play a practical joke on the Americans.  Stephen went over to the Americans' table, flashed the fake badge and told them that he was an FBI agent who had them under surveillance.  He said they were all under arrest for suspected terrorist activity.  At first the tourists became quite frightened.  However, once they realized they had been the victims of a silly prank, they called the Toronto police and the police arrested Stephen for impersonating a peace officer.

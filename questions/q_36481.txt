Here is a fun one that should be workable but challenging.  Create the program and upload you file below. (I suggest no more than 40 minute for your first attempt, than move on and return to it later if time permits) The Dayton Electronic Manufacturing, Inc (DEMI) company manufactures two styles of remote keyless entry systems  (the X30 and the X40) that various auto dealers supply to customers when a new (or used) automobile is purchased. DEMI currently operates four production facilities located in Springfield OH, Hartford, New Orleans, and Orlando. The manufactured items are shipped from the plants to regional distribution centers located in Trenton, Chicago and Seattle. It is from these regional locations that the product is distributed nationwide. As more automobile manufactures include keyless entry as a standard option, and DEMI finds itself locked out of the manufacturer market, demand for DEMI's products have decreased. As a result, management is contemplating closing one or more of its production facilities. Distribution facilities are not currently being considered for closing.   Each production facility carries a fixed operating cost and a variable cost associated with building each of the products. Data has been compiled on production costs, resource availability, and resource usage at each of the production plants. That information is summarized in the table below.       Plant    Fixed Cost per Month      Production Cost (Per 100)  X30     Production Cost (Per 100)  X40   Production time (hr/100)  X30   Production time (hr/100)  X40   Available hr Per Month     Springfield  53,000 1100  1300   6   6   720     Harford  38,000 1100  1250   7   8   780     New Orleans  25,000  1000   1000   5  5  530     Orlando   28,000   1200   1500   5   9   680       The entry systems are sold nation wide at thes ame prices: $24 for the X30 and $30 for the X40.   Current monthly demand projections at each distribution center for both products are given in the following table.       Demand   Trenton   Chicago   Seattle     X30   2200   3100   4000     X40`   4500   5800   6000     The transportation costs between each plant and each distribution center, which are the same for either product, are shown in the following table:    Transport Cost per 100  Trenton   Chicago   Seattle     Springfield  200 270 450    Harford  100 200 700    New Orleans  250 240 300    Orlando  180 220 350       Determine which of the plants to close and which to keep Determine the number of X30 and X40 to be produced at each Determine a shipping pattern from the plants to the distribution Maximize the net total monthly profits.  Do not exceed the production capacities at any plant.    Formulate DEMI's problem as a fixed charge, linear/integer program (MIP). Implement your model in Excel and solve the model to answer DEMI's questions.

Use the following vignette to answer questions 3 and 4 A 35-year-old woman is evaluated for a 10-month history of intense abdominal pain and bloating after eating.  Her discomfort was initially intermittent, but during the last 5 months it has been present with every meal, lasting approximately 1 hour before resolving.  When asked to identify where she feels bloating, she points to her mid-epigastric region.   Eating smaller meals decreases the intensity and duration of the discomfort. She denies having pain or difficulty when swallowing, heartburn, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. Calcium carbonate antacids (Rolaids) do not relieve her symptoms.  The patient smokes cigarettes, but denies drinking alcoholic beverages. She has gained approximately 9 kg (20 lb) over the past year. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and she takes no medications. On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Body mass index is 32.  Palpation reveals tenderness in the epigastric section of the abdomen, both upper left and right quadrant.  Auscultation of the abdomen reveals normal bowel sounds.  No bruits are detected.  The remainder of the physical examination is within normal limits.  A complete blood count is normal. 3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Cilia and flagella

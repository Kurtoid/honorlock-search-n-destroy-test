A nutrition store in the mall is selling an herbal supplement intended to improve memory. To test the effectiveness (i.e., the influence on memory) of the herbal mixture, a skeptical researcher obtains a sample of n = 36 people and requests that each person take the suggested dosage each day for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4-week period, each individual takes a standardized memory test (large numbers indicate better memory). The scores from the sample produced a mean of M = 26. In the general population, the standardized memory test is known to have a mean of u = 30 and s = 12. Do the sample data support the conclusion that the herbal supplement improved memory? To answer this question, go through the 7 steps for hypothesis testing and use a = .05 (critical value = +-1.65). SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. 1) IV(s) and DV(s) and the number of tails: 2) State Hypotheses: 3) Describe where the critical region(s) would be on a distribution. 4) Calculate the z-score for the sample mean (if possible bold, underline, or indicate your final answer). 5) Decision: 6) Effect size: 7) Plain English interpretation and APA statistical information:

Senario QusestionsPlease use the following information to answer the question(s) below.Placozoan evolutionary relationships to other animals are currently unclear, and different phylogenies can be created, depending on the characters used to infer relatedness. Placozoans are multicellular invertebrates with a simple structure of only two tissue layers and only four cell types. They have the smallest amount of DNA measured in any animal. In comparison, sponges have no tissues but about 20 cell types. One species of placozoans, Tp (Trichoplax adhaerens), produces a neuropeptide almost identical to one found in cnidarians. The genome of Tp, although the smallest of any known animal, shares many features of complex eumetazoan (even human!) genomes. The next three questions refer to the phylogenetic trees that follow. In the trees, the outgroup is a taxon that is outside the group of interest; members of the group of interest are more closely related to one another than to the outgroup.Which tree(s) has (have) been created by emphasizing genomic features of placozoans?

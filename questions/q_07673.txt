Hypnosis is something that has and has not been successful with helping people stop smoking. I obtain a sample of 24 smokers. Before undergoing hypnosis, I have each person record the number of cigarettes that they smoked that week. They undergo hypnosis and then I have them record the number of cigarettes that they smoked the week after hypnosis. The data show MD = -2.4 with a variance of SS = 750 for the sample of difference scores. Does hypnosis influence the number of cigarettes that people smoked? Use an a = .05. a. How many tails? What is the IV and DV? (3pts)b. State the null and alternative hypotheses using the appropriate symbols. (2 pts)c. Identify the critical value that will serve as the decision criterion. (1 pt)d. Compute the appropriate test statistic. Show your work and bold, underline, and italicize your final answer. (4 pts)e. State your decision regarding the null hypothesis. (1 pt)f.

An open box (no lid) is to have a square base. The  enclosed volume of this box is to be 864 in3.  The goal of this problem is to find the dimensions that will produce a box that will use as little surface area as possible.  To answer this question, consider the following:  Let x = the length of the base and let y = the height of the box.  a)    You know that volume = length x width x height. Using the given information, write an equation for the volume, then solve it for y.  b)    The surface area is the sum of the areas of all sides. In this situation with no lid, the surface area is S = 4xy + x2.  Substitute what you got for y in (a) and simplify. This is the surface area function, S(x).  c)   Take it from here. Find the dimensions (x and y) that will minimize the surface area. If rounding is necessary, do so to the nearest tenth.

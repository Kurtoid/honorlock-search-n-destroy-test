You are to administer ampicillin 100 mg IM q 4 hours.  The vial states that you should reconstitute with 1.2 ml of sterile water to provide a concentration of 125mg/ml.  How many ml should you administer?
The set of dilatometry  heating curves shown below for polyGower were of two samples that had been processed differently from their melts, with each having been cooled at a different rate.    -  Choose from the parentheses the type of transitions that occur for this polymer:  A (first / second) [1] order transition occurs at a temperature of 135degC, and a (first / second) [2] order transition occurs at a temperature of -40degC. - One curve corresponds to polymer that had been quenched rapidly from melt, and the other is for the same polymer that was allowed to cool slowly for several hours.  Which curve corresponds to the quenched sample?  Fill in blank with (red or blue). [3] If anyone is colorblind, the top curve is red and the bottom curve is blue. - Which of the following best describes the room temperature (25degC) physical characteristics of the  blue polyGower?   Fill in blank with choice of A - D. [4]     (A)  Glassy and brittle     (B)  Hard and rigid     (C)  Flexible and tough     (D)  Rubbery elastomer (assuming very high MW) - Which of the following best describes the room temperature (25degC) physical characteristics of the red polyGower?  Fill in blank with choice of A - D.  [5]     (A)  Glassy and brittle     (B)  Hard and rigid     (C)  Flexible and tough     (D)  Rubbery elastic (assuming very high MW) - What will be the density of the blue polyGower at room temperature?  Fill in blank with choice from A thru F: [6]     (A)  density = 0.971 g/cc     (B)  density =  0.997 g/cc     (C)  density = 1.003 g/cc     (D)  density = 1.030 g/cc     (E)  density = 1.043 g/cc     (F)  density = 1.055 g/cc    (G)  density = 1.060 g/cc - If one were to take the red polyGower and let it age for a very long time at room temperature, how would the specific volume of the polymer change? Chose from A thru E: [7]    (A)  The Vsp would decrease to eventually approach 0.977 cc/g.    (B)  The Vsp would decrease to eventually approach 1.003 cc/g.    (C) The Vsp would increase to eventually approach 0.977 cc/g.    (D)  The Vsp would increase to eventually approach 1.003 cc/g.    (E)  The Vsp would stay the same. - The reason for this is because the polymer chains can (coil/ relax / stiffen) [8] and try to come closer to their equilibrium conformations, thereby slowly (increasing / decreasing) [9] the free volume that had been trapped and frozen in when the sample was cooled rapidly. Because this polymer can crystallize, the chains might slowly become more organized and increase in crystallinity as well.  Such processes could be hastened if a slightly (lower / higher) [10] temperature was used to more readily enable various chain motions.

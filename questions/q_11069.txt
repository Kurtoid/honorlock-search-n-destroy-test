Three point charges are fixed in space on the coordinate system shown below. The coordinate axes are marked in meters.      a) Find the electric field at point P, located at the origin. b) Calculate the electric field at a point P' at position r= 11 mi + 8 mj [ r=(11 m, 8 m)]. c) Find the force on an additional charge of qo=-6.4x10-6 C placed at the origin. d) What is the force on a charge of 4.9x10-2 C if it is placed at point P'? part a)  Now calculate the magnitudes of each of the contributions to ther electric field at point P.    = 1.636   x  105    = 1.001   x  105    = 9.250   x  105 7. What are the units for electric field? Use only SI abbreviations for the base units. SI unit: [unit1]/[unit2]

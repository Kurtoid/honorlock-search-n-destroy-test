TEST 5490/4495-4    Spring 2021     1 (35%). Sketch the total electric field change vs. time due to a negative, uniformly charged lightning leader developing vertically toward ground from a spherically symmetrical cloud charge source. On the same sketch show the field-change components due to the developing leader channel and due to the depletion of the cloud charge source.   In producing your sketch use the following input parameters. The height H of the charge source above ground is 8 km, the line charge density is 10-3 C/m, the speed v of the leader tip is 107 m/s, and the horizontal distance D from the charge center is 7 km. How would the waveforms change if the speed were 105 m/s?         2 (35%). Show that at horizontal distances of the order of tens of meters or less the net electric field change due to a uniformly charged leader is approximately inversely proportional to distance. How should the net return-stroke electric field change vary with distance in this distance range?         3 (30%). It has been observed that at distances of 10 km and farther the lightning leader electric field waveshape depends on stroke order: 89% of first-stroke leaders exhibit monotonic positive waveforms, whereas 89% of subsequent strokes of order 8 through 18 show hook-shaped, net negative waveforms. Explain why.

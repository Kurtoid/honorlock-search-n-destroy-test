a) List four factors that affect the biodegradation rate of polymers. (2 points) b) You are testing two biodegradable polymer scaffolds for vascular grafting applications. One scaffold is mainly composed of elastin and the other is mainly composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). As a first test, you are implanting the two types of scaffolds subcutaneously (under the skin) in a mouse model. In a few of the mice from your experiment, the concentration of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases was found to be an order of magnitude higher than for the other mice. Would you expect each of the scaffolds in these mice to degrade faster or slower than others from the 'normal' mice and why? (2 points) c) You've chosen a PLGA polymer with a melting point of ~60oC as the material for this vascular graft scaffold. Which of the following sterilization techniques would be most appropriate to sterilize this porous polymer scaffold: autoclaving, X-ray irradiation, or hydrogen peroxide plasma treatment? Justify your choice (i.e. briefly comment on suitability of each technique). (3 points)

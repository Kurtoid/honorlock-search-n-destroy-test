Consider an example of calculating the future value of savings. Suppose you have $1,000 in your saving account, and the yearly interest rate is r, then your saving balance by the end of the n-th years will be 1000*(1+r)n. (Hint: the corresponding formula in Excel would be "=1000*(1+r)^n" ). Now we want to see how the saving balance would differ if the interest rate r and the number of years n vary.  The Data Table for What-If Analysis serves as a right tool for this purpose. In the figure below, suppose the formula in cell B2 is "=1000*(1+K1)^K2" (cells K1 and K2 contain the original interest rate and number of years, respectively). To create the data table, which cell needs to be specified as the "Row Input Cell"?

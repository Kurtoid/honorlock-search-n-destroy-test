Use the example below to solve the exercises that follow. Show all steps using the Graphical Equation Editor.   Example:Determine whether the given polynomial is a perfect square trinomial, then factor it.          x2+14x+49{"version":"1.1","math":"x2+14x+49"} Solution:Determine whether the given polynomial is a perfect square trinomial (Step 1&2), then factor it (Step 3).Step 1 Check if the first and third terms are both perfect squares with positive coefficients.        x2=(x)2{"version":"1.1","math":"x2=(x)2"}and 49=(7)2{"version":"1.1","math":"49=(7)2"}Step 2 Identify a{"version":"1.1","math":"a"}  and b{"version":"1.1","math":"b"} , and determine if the middle term equals 2ab{"version":"1.1","math":"2ab"}  or -2ab{"version":"1.1","math":"-2ab"}.         a = x{"version":"1.1","math":"a = x"}  and  b = 7{"version":"1.1","math":"b = 7"}       2ab=2(x)(7)=14x{"version":"1.1","math":"2ab=2(x)(7)=14x"}Step 3 Use the first formula to factor the trinomial.     x2+14x+49=(x+7)2 {"version":"1.1","math":"x2+14x+49=(x+7)2 "} ExerciseDetermine whether each of the given polynomials is a perfect square trinomial.  If yes, then factor it. If not, then state so.  All steps are required for full credit.  a)  w2-16w+64{"version":"1.1","math":"w2-16w+64"}     and   b)  z2+6z+36{"version":"1.1","math":"z2+6z+36"} Step 1 Check if the first and third terms are both perfect squares with positive coefficients.         Step 2 Identify a{"version":"1.1","math":"a"}  and b{"version":"1.1","math":"b"} , and determine if the middle term equals 2ab{"version":"1.1","math":"2ab"}  or -2ab{"version":"1.1","math":"-2ab"}.     Step 3 Use the proper formula to factor the trinomial.

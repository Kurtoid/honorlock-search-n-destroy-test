Final Essay Exam The Professor and the Madman This essay must be written in front of a proctor (Honorlock).  It must include quotes to support the argument.  It must have a clearly stated thesis statement that maps out what the 3 main body paragraphs will discuss.  This needs to be a 5 paragraph essay.  It should be between approximately 500 and 700 words. To write this essay successfully, I recommend that you create an outline for the essay and write the quotes that you plan to use on your outline. You will be allowed to use the outline during your proctoring session. You may NOT write your whole essay in advance on the outline.

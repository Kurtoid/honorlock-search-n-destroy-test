By acknowledging these exam conditions, I acknowledge my personal responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the examination process.  I will keep all personal items, such as cell phones, iPods, smartwatches, or other communication devices securely stored during all testing procedures. I will not leave the area I am in during the exam. Restroom breaks should be taken before or after taking the exam. I will not attempt to access the internet, use a telephone, or otherwise communicate with outside resources during the exam. I will show (front and back) my notes to the camera prior to starting the exam and after answering my last test question if this quiz is in an online forum. I will maintain the integrity of the exam process by refraining from discussing exam items with anyone other than my professor until exam grades are posted. I will follow up with my professor(s) after the exam if I have questions or concerns about my exam performance.  I understand that academic dishonesty is a violation of the university's code of conduct. I also understand that my exam will not be graded and I will receive a zero unless I acknowledge these conditions of the exam.

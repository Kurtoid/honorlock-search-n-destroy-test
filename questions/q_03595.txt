Suppose a group is interested in determining whether teenagers obtain their drivers licenses at approximately the same average age across the country. Suppose that data are randomly collected from five teenagers in each region of the country.  The numbers represent the age at which teenagers obtained their drivers licenses.  An ANOVA was performed to determine whether or not significant differences exist among the mean ages for the five different regional groups.  Assume a = 0.05.  The partially completed ANOVA Table is located below.

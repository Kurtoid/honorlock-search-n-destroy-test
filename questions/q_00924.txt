Hello we are Innocent - Our story We are three entrepreneurs who met at university and formed Innocent after test marketing our first drink at a music festival. We are now Europe's best-selling smoothie business and continue to develop new and healthy products. Our purpose is to make natural, delicious and healthy drinks that help people live well. Innocent smoothie drinks contain the finest fruit we can find; we do not add sugar or anything else. We make tasty, healthy and convenient products to help people have more fruit and vegetables in their diet.  Our products include:  * Smoothies and juices made entirely from fruit and vegetables * Drinks and snacks for children  * Lunch pots that provide three portions of vegetables in every pot  * Coconut water, which is natural and fat free  * The first smoothie made from 100% British fruit. Our product trials and test marketing  * We sold our first smoothies from a stall at a music festival in London. We put up a big sign asking people if they thought we should give up our jobs to make smoothies, and put a box saying 'Yes' and a box saying 'No' in front of the stall. Then we got people to vote by putting their empty bottles into the boxes marked 'Yes' or 'No'. At the end of the weekend, the 'Yes' box was full, so we gave up our jobs to start Innocent.  * We agreed to a contract with a UK supermarket to sell our smoothies in 10 of their shops before launching on a larger scale.  * We regularly visit schools close to our offices and ask the children to taste and give feedback on new products that we are developing for our younger consumers.

Commute times are sometimes a factor in choosing a city, home, or job. Suppose that a researcher wants to estimate the average commute time for people employed in Orlando.  She takes a random sample of 200 people employed in Orlando and finds that the mean commute time for the sample is 25.4 minutes and the standard deviation is 5.7 minutes.  Based on this the 95% confidence interval is 24.6 to 26.2 minutes.   Suppose that a coworker makes the statement that the mean commute time in Orlando is more than 20 minutes.  Based on the information in the problem we can conclude that the:

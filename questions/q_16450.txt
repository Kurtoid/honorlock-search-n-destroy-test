A cross-bridge forms when a mysoin head -- already bound to [1] -- binds to an active site.  The myosin head releases [2], which provides energy for the power-stroke which causes the thin and thick filaments to slide past each other.  The head then releases [3]. [4] binds to the myosin head, causing the cross-bridge to break. The myosin head then [5], providing energy for the recovery stroke.  The four steps above are repeated as long as [6].

17,  Read the following passage from an essay on culture by American anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn (1905-1960). Then choose which statement is most logically supported by the information.  promiscuous: active sexually and relatively unselective about sexual partners celibacy:          going without sexual activity reciprocities: exchanges Every culture must deal with the sexual instinct.  Some, however, seek to deny all sexual expression before marriage, whereas a Polynesian adolescent who was not promiscuousdeg would be distinctly abnormal.  Some cultures enforce lifelong monogamy, while others, like our own, tolerate serial monogamy; in still other cultures, two or more women may be joined to one man or several men to a single woman.  Homosexuality has been a permitted pattern in the Greco-Roman world, in parts of Islam, and in various primitive tribes.  Large portions of the population of Tibet, and of Christendom at some places and periods, have practiced complete celibacydeg.  To us marriage is first and foremost an arrangement between two individuals.  In many more societies marriage is merely one facet of a complicated set of reciprocitiesdeg, economic and otherwise, between two families or two clans.

No paragraph response is required for this question.     Grass   BY CARL SANDBURG    Pile the bodies high at Austerlitz and Waterloo. Shovel them under and let me work--                                           I am the grass; I cover all. And pile them high at Gettysburg And pile them high at Ypres and Verdun. Shovel them under and let me work. Two years, ten years, and passengers ask the conductor:                                           What place is this?                                           Where are we now?                                           I am the grass.                                           Let me work.   The Road Not Taken    BY ROBERT FROST    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.   Annabel Lee   BY EDGAR ALLAN POE    It was many and many a year ago,    In a kingdom by the sea, That a maiden there lived whom you may know    By the name of Annabel Lee; And this maiden she lived with no other thought    Than to love and be loved by me. I was a child and she was a child,    In this kingdom by the sea, But we loved with a love that was more than love--    I and my Annabel Lee-- With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven    Coveted her and me. And this was the reason that, long ago,    In this kingdom by the sea, A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling    My beautiful Annabel Lee; So that her highborn kinsmen came    And bore her away from me, To shut her up in a sepulchre    In this kingdom by the sea. The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,    Went envying her and me-- Yes!--that was the reason (as all men know,    In this kingdom by the sea) That the wind came out of the cloud by night,    Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. But our love it was stronger by far than the love    Of those who were older than we--    Of many far wiser than we-- And neither the angels in Heaven above    Nor the demons down under the sea Can ever dissever my soul from the soul    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side    Of my darling--my darling--my life and my bride,    In her sepulchre there by the sea--    In her tomb by the sounding sea.

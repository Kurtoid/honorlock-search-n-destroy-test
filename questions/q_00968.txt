A freeway initially has one lane and adds a lane at location x = 0 mile. On the 2-lane section, the maximum flow is 4,000 vph, the jam density is 400 veh/mile, and the free flow speed is 60 mph. On the 1-lane section, the maximum flow is 2,000 vph, the jam density is 200 veh/mile, and the free flow speed is 60 mph. On a particular day, the traffic condition on this segment is freely flowing with flow of 1600 vph. Then, a severe accident occurs 1 mile downstream of x = 0 (i.e., at x = 1) and restricts flow to 1,000 vph. The accident is cleared one hour later.   (a) [5 points] Draw the fundamental diagrams for the 2-lane and 1-lane sections. (Assume triangular flow- density relations.) (b) [10 points] Draw a time-space diagram depicting the formation and dissipation of the queue resulting from the accident. Label clearly all traffic states and compute all relevant wave speeds. (c) [5 points] Compute the total distance that the queue travels.

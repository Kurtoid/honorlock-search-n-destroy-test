Read the passage below and answer the question that follows. Online Social Networks2 If there is a "killer app" on the Internet, it is social networks. Online social networks have developed very large worldwide audiences and form the basis for new advertising platforms and for social e-commerce. Online social networks are services that support communication within networks of friends, colleagues, and entire professions. The largest social networks are Facebook (1 billion worldwide), LinkedIn (175 million worldwide), Twitter (more than 140 million active users worldwide), and Pinterest (more than 100 million). These networks rely on user-generated content (messages, photos, and videos) and emphasize sharing of content.According to the context, user-generated content ________.

A quality control analyst is using a 1-sided upper test of hypothesis on mu with mu0 = 11.2 cm for the diameter of a part.   The diameter is assumed to be normally distributed, with population standard deviation equal to 0.8 cm.  This question is part of a quiz or exam given at Arizona State University, copywritten by Dr. L. Chattin.  It may not be reproduced, posted or distributed without permission of Arizona State University and L. Chattin. . The analyst samples nine diameters and is using  P(Type I error) = 0.01.  If the true population mean is 11.15 cm, what is the probability of Type II error?  Select the answer closest to yours.

Consider a mass, m1 being pulled up an inclined, frictionless surface by a mass, m2, as shown in the diagram below.  Find an equation for the total kinetic energy of the system in terms of the speed of the masses, v.Find an equation for the potential energy of the system ion terms of x.(Note that you must account for the rise in the elevation of m1 in your equation.)Consider the following data: m1 = 0.2 kg, m2 = 0.025 kg, sin th =0.0275, v = 0.309 m/s, x=0.0225 m.Calculate the kinetic energy, K, and the potential elergy U.Since the total mechanical energy is zero, show how well your experiment confirms the conservation of energy by calculating the % difference between K and the absolute value of U.

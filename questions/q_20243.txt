The figure above represents the analysis of the proteasome in humans, flies, sea urchins.  *    On the left, "fractions" refer to the biochemical size fractionation of the complexes (purification) from each organism.  *    In the center is a species pairwise heatmap (dark blue: correlation =1.0, yellow: correlation = 0.1).  The y-axis is based on fractions shown in left panel; x-axis are the protein subunits of the proteasome.  *    The right hierarchical clustering is generated from the correlation matrix, and the nodes defining elements of the proteasome (protein subunits) are identified. Comparing ONLY consider only the data shown in the left panel (fractionations), the data for human, fly and sea urchin The overall conclusion you would draw would be

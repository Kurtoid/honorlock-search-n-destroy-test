The following question came from the Mastering Biology homework. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects cells that have both CD4 and CCR5 cell surface molecules. The viral nucleic acid molecules are enclosed in a protein capsid, and the protein capsid is itself contained inside an envelope consisting of a lipid bilayer membrane and viral glycoproteins. One hypothesis for viral entry into cells is that binding of HIV membrane glycoproteins to CD4 and CCR5 initiates fusion of the HIV membrane with the plasma membrane, releasing the viral capsid into the cytoplasm. An alternative hypothesis is that HIV gains entry into the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and membrane fusion occurs in the endocytotic vesicle. To test these alternative hypotheses for HIV entry, researchers labeled the lipids on the HIV membrane with a red fluorescent dye.    What would be observed by live-cell fluorescence microscopy immediately after HIV entry if HIV is endocytosed first, and then later fuses with the endocytotic vesicle membrane?(a) The red fluorescent dye-labeled lipids will appear in the infected cell's interior.(b) A spot of red fluorescence will remain outside the cell after delivering the viral capsid.(c) A spot of red fluorescence will diffuse in the infected cell's cytoplasm.(d) A spot of red fluorescence will be visible on the infected cell's plasma membrane, marking the site of membrane fusion and HIV entry. Explain why option (a) is correct and why options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect.  (Note: Please write your response for each option separately for ease of grading.  Also, merely stating the negative of the answer choice will not earn points as you must adequately explain/defend your answer to demonstrate that you truly understand the material.)

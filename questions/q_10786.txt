When it comes to motor control, there is this concept of open loop vs. closed loop control. This concept applies to the function of the Premotor cortex and the Cerebellum. In general, open loop is linear, while closed loop is circular. Identify if the following statements describe open loop or closed loop motor control.  a) The medial region of the premotor cortex plans a movement (according to the plan of actions of the prefrontal cortex), then sends that information on, so the movement is executed by the primary motor cortex, and that's it. This describes _____[a]____ b) The lateral region of the premotor cortex plans movements, then sends that information on, so the movement is executed, and while the movement is executed the premotor cortex uses feedback to modify the planning and execution of the ongoing movement. This describes _______[b]_____ c) The _______[c]____is most suitable for movements that are very fast and thus, once they are initiated, there is no time for changing the plan. d) The Cerebellum may influence the motor programs which were originally involved in the planning and execution of an ongoing movement. This describes ____[d]_____ e) The _____[e]____ of the premotor cortex makes it possible for us to respond quickly to sensory cues with motor output planning, by omitting complex prefrontal cortex processing.   f) The Cerebellum may influence motor programs other than those that were originally involved in the planning and execution of a movements. This describes ___[f]______

Dynamic (real-time) imaging is made possible because:
Member ABC is supported by a pin at B and by a cord attached at A and C that passes over a frictionless pulley at E.  Given the distributed loading applied along AD and applied couple at C, determine the tension in the cord and the reaction at B. Assume that the weight of the rod is negligible compared to the applied loads.

(20 points) Develop an E-R model to organize the following data of a database that coordinates marathons around the state of Arizona.  The following data needs to be collected.  SSN, ParticipantMeasurements (height, weight),  ParticipantName, ParticipantAddress, BirthDate, Age, RaceLocation, RaceDate, RaceID, RaceDistance, RunningTime, FinishStatus Note that the database keeps information about the running time and finish status of each runner  for all the races organized so far. A race can have unlimited number of participants but needs at lease one to qualify as a race. For this database a participant can only join one race.

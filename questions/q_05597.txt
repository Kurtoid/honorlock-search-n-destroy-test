In England approximately 250 years ago, the peppered moth had light-colored wing patterns that camouflaged them against the light-colored trees. Over time in urban areas, the number of peppered moths with dark-colored wings increased as pollution from the Industrial Revolution darkened the trees the moths rested on. Which of the following statements best describes how the moths adapted to the new environment over time?
Which of the following body structures is part of both the digestive and endocrine systems?
Consider the following payoff matrix:     State of Nature   Decision X Y   A 175 95   B 125 105    The probability that X occurs is 0.5 (i.e., the probability that Y occurs is 0.5). Suppose that the perfect information about states of nature is given to a decision maker. What is the expected value of perfect information?

Your client is considering the construction of a transfer station.  Currently they haul 900 tons of waste per day (on average) in 24 yd3 garbage trucks to a landfill.  If this build a transfer station, they could haul their waste in 100 yd3 transfer trailers.  The density of waste in a garbage truck is 600 lb/yd3 on average, while the density of waste in a transfer trailer will be 800 lb/yd3.   The fuel efficiency of the current garbage trucks is 8 miles per gallon and the fuel efficiency of a transfer trailer hauled by a semi-truck is 5 miles per gallon; the cost of fuel is $2.75/gallon.  The non-fuel cost associated with a garbage truck is $0.75/mile and the non-fuel cost associated with a transfer trailer is $1.40/mile. The daily cost to build/operate a transfer station is $4,200/day. A) What is the break-even distance (one way distance from service area to landfill) where it becomes feasible for a transfer station to be constructed ?

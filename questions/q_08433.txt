(2 points)  A magnetar is a rare type of rotating neutron star with one of the most powerful magnetic fields in the universe. On March 12, 2020, a magnetar called Swift J1818.0-1607 was discovered in our own Milky Way galaxy, and it is the fastest spinning magnetar ever discovered, spinning at a rate of once every 1.4 seconds!  It's a spherical object with a mass twice that of the Sun (mass of Sun is 1.99 x 1030 kg), but with a diameter less than 20 miles (about 30 km)!  Suppose a mysterious force was exerted tangent to the star at it's equator, causing the rate of spin to slow down to once every 24 hours (like Earth), and suppose it took 1 year (31,557,600 seconds) for this change to take place. a. How much force would be required to cause this change? b. How much torque would be required?

Select the mathematical statements to correctly fill in the beginning of the proof of an inductive step below:   We will assume for k>=1 that 7 evenly divides 62k-1 and will prove that 7 evenly divides 62(k+1)-1 .   Since, by the inductive hypothesis, 7 evenly divides 62k-1 , then 62k can be expressed as (A), where m is an integer.   Thus, 62(k+1)-1=62[?]62k-1 =(B) by the inductive hypothesis=...

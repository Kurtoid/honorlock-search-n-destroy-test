Which of the following applies to both photovoltaic solar power and wind power?
DrrA is thought to interact with rab1.  The gel below shows the results from a co-immunoprecipitation experiment involving various GST-tagged rab proteins mixed with DrrA.  The rab proteins are listed at the top of the gel, including mutant rab1 proteins locked in either the GDP- or GTP-bound form.  A GST antibody was used for the co-immunoprecipitation.  A protein stain was used to visualize proteins in the top gel; a Western blot against DrrA was used to visualize proteins in the bottom gel. (i) Why was GST alone (far right lane) used for one of the co-immunoprecipitation conditions?  (ii)  Why were GST-tagged variants of rab 5 and rab7 used for this experiment?  (iii)  DrrA can be detected by protein stain, so why was a Western blot also run?

STATISTICS A researcher analyzes the factors that may influence amusement park attendance. She estimates the following model: Attendance = B0 + B1 Price+ B2 Temperature + B3 Rides + e  where Attendance is the daily attendance (in 1000s), Price is the gate price (in $), Temperature is the average daily temperature (in oF), and Rides is the number of rides at the amusement park. A portion of the regression results is shown in the accompanying table.  When testing whether the explanatory variables are jointly significant we would use the F statistic which has a value of most nearly

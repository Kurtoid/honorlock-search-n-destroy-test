The Harleysville Manufacturing Shop produces motorcycle parts. Typically, 10 pieces out of a job lot of 1,000 parts are spoiled. Costs are assigned at the inspection point, $50.00 per unit. Spoiled pieces may be disposed at $10.00 per unit. The spoiled goods must be inventoried appropriately when the normal spoilage is detected. The current job requires the production of 2,500 good parts. Which of the following journal entries properly reflects the recording of spoiled goods? A) Materials Control 200 Manufacturing Overhead Control      800       Work-in-Process Control                                     1,000 B) Manufacturing Overhead Control 1,000       Materials Control                                                     200       Work-in-Process Control                                        800 C) Materials Control 250 Manufacturing Overhead Control   1,000       Work-in-Process Control                                     1,250 D) Work-in-Process Control 1,250       Materials Control                                                     250       Manufacturing Overhead Control                     1,000
Typical groups will have a peak night which is the night with the largest number of rooms. The nights before and after the peak night are known as:
Rudolph and Riley (2017) discuss the differences between compliance and cooperation. In the case study associated with tiger conservation in Bukit Barisan National Park in Sumatra, Indonesia, wildlife conservation officials enacted a number of rules, such as no snare hunting in the reserve, associated with the conservation of tigers. If community members decide to follow these rules, this would be an example of what?

A patient is asking advice about which over-the-counter antacid is considered the most safe to use for heartburn. The nurse explains that the reason that calcium antacids are not used as frequently as other antacids is for which of these reasons?
Only work in Canvas will be graded for this question. At numerous times in the last few weeks, Dr. Pantazes has stated that Figure 5-4 (page 195) is the TS diagram for both a reversible heat engine and a reversible refrigeration cycle. Problems 2 and 3 use the same fluid (H2O) and operate between the same pressures (0.8 and 20 bar), yet the work of the reversible turbine and the reversible compressor for the systems are not equal and opposite. Explain why this is the case. If you were unsuccessful in solving Problem 2 and/or 3, you may use values of -400 for the reversible turbine and +700 kJ / kg for the reversible compressor in your explanation. Standard Advice for Explain Questions: A definition alone is not a good explanation, although it may be part of one. A good explanation expands beyond a definition to clearly and concisely articulate the key concepts of the explanation and why they are important in CHEN.

HMK Enterprises would like to raise $10.0 million to invest in capital expenditures. The company plans to issue five-year bonds with a face value of $1,000 and a coupon rate of 6.55% (annual payments). The following table summarizes the yield to maturity for five-year (annual-payment) coupon corporate bonds of various ratings:     Rating   AAA   AA   A   BBB   BB     YTM   6.17%   6.32%   6.55%   6.95%   7.57%      Assuming the bonds will be rated AA, what will be the price of the bonds? How much of the total principal amount of these bonds must HMK issue to raise $10.0 million today, assuming the bonds are AA rated? (Because HMK cannot issue a fraction of a bond, assume that all fractions are rounded to the nearest whole number.)
A steam engine runs on the Rankine cycle. The steam leaves the boiler at 20 bar and 250 oC. The turbine has an efficiency of 70% and an outlet pressure of 1 bar. Pressure changes in the boiler and condenser can be considered negligible and the liquid leaving the condenser is saturated. What is the efficiency of this Rankine cycle?

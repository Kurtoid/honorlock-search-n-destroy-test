QUESTION 4     Consider a 10 kg block accelerating at 4 m.s-2 down an incline, which is at 35o with the horizontal. Right click on the following button to open the DIAGRAM in a separate tab.        4.1   State Newton's Second Law of Motion in words.    (3)     4.2   Draw a labelled free-body diagram to represent all the forces acting on the block.    (3)         Ignore the effect of friction. Calculate the:         4.3   net force acting on the block.    (3)     4.4   component of the weight of the block parallel to the incline.    (3)     4.5   coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the surface of the incline.   (4)                           [16]

Gel electrophoresis is normally set up with the negative electrode at the top of the gel and the positive electrode at the bottom of the gel. The DNA products are loaded at the top of the gel, and then a current is applied to separate them. However, when preparing to run a gel, you accidentally switched the locations of the negative and positive electrodes such that the positive electrode is at the top and the negative electrode is at the bottom. You still loaded the DNA products at the top of the gel as normal. What result are you most likely to observe if you apply an electric current to this gel setup?
Identify the sample above. (fizzes with acid)

A 0.096-kg block on a horizontal frictionless surface is attached to an ideal massless spring whose spring constant is 270 N/m. The block is pulled from its equilibrium position at x=0.00 m to a displacement x = +0.080 m and is released from rest. The block then executes simple harmonic motion along the horizontal x-axis. When the displacement is x=-0.046m, find the acceleration of the block.

Question 1 - 11 points A) Build a multiple linear regression model named model1 with Adult Mortality as the response variable and all other variables as predicting variables. Include an intercept. Display the summary table of the model. B) Is the overall regression significant at the 0.01 alpha level? Explain. C) Using model1, calculate the Cook's distance of the points in the dataset and create a plot for the Cook's Distances.  D) Identify the row number of the observation with the highest Cook's distance.  E) Remove this observation from the mortality dataset. Call this new dataset mortality2 and create a new multiple linear regression model, called model2, using the same predictors as model1 with Adult Mortality as the response. Display the summary table of this model. Are there any significant differences between the models with and without the outlier? Would you classify this observation as influential?

Write a function called springDates() that takes in one parameter: a list of holidays (str). Each string in the list is formatted as: "month day". The function should return a dictionary of months mapped to a list of holidays in that month (ints).  Hint: string methods may be very useful for this problem  Example Output #1:  >>> holidays = ["March 20", "May 5", "April 1", "May 9"] >>> springDates(holidays){'March': [20], 'May': [5, 9], 'April': [1]}  Example Output #2: >>> holidays = ["March 16", "March 17", "March 23", "April 2"]>>> springDates(holidays){"March": [16, 17, 23], "April": [2]}

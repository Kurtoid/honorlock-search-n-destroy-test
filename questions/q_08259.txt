TREATMENT - Child Language Disorders You have Caitlin, an 8-year 6-month old third grader on your caseload.  She is from a family where only Standard American English is spoken and is from a mainstream American middle class family.  She goes to a high quality school in Bergen County, New Jersey.  Her parents both have college degrees.  Her father is a history teacher and her mother is a reading teacher.  Overall she has difficulty making inferences, identifying the main idea, and problem solving, and this is reflected in her language, which tends to limit dependent clauses to clauses beginning with 'because' and 'when' but with few other temporal, causal, or relational clauses.  While she can read the words because she has acquired the early literacy skills of decoding, sight words, and phonological awareness, she is having difficulty comprehending grade level texts because she is having difficulty making connections within the text.  Caitlin particularly has difficulty inferencing, problem solving, and identifying the main idea of a passage.  Her speech development is age appropriate and her vocabulary skills are age appropriate. Discuss three communication/language goals (not speech goals) you would develop for Caitlin.  Provide a brief rationale for each goal.  Discuss how each goal addresses the problems she has been having in the classroom, particularly in making inferences, problem solving, and identifying the main idea of a passage.

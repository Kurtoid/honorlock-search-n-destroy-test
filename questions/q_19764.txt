You are studying a population of 100 pigs, in which a single gene with two alleles controls ear shape. The allele for erect ears (E) is completely dominant to the allele for droopy ears (e). The frequency of the E allele in the population is 0.20. Answer the following four questions about this population. A. How many total alleles for this gene are there in the gene pool of this population (i.e., what is the total size of the gene pool)? [v1] B. What is the frequency of the e allele in this population? [v2] C. If the pigs in this population are allowed to mate randomly, what is the expected frequency of heterozygotes in the next generation, assuming there are no evolutionary forces acting on the population? [v3] D. You return to the pig population after hunting season and perform genetic tests and hearing performance tests on the remaining pigs. You find that the frequency of the E allele increased, because pigs with erect hears could hear better and survive better than pigs with droopy ears (you found this in your tests). Based on this information, the increase of the frequency of the E allele is most likely due to [v4]

(Q001) Abortion laws are among the most contentious public policies in the United States. In 1973 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a woman's right to privacy extended to her decision to have an abortion. This right was balanced, however, by the state's interest in guaranteeing safe and effective medical regulations. The balance has led to considerable controversy over the last 40 years as many state legislatures tried to limit the opportunities for women to have an abortion. Texas passed legislation in 2013 that effectively would have shuttered three-fourths of the abortion clinics in Texas. These laws, requiring abortion facilities to be like surgical facilities and requiring doctors providing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, were invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016. In the decision Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, the Court reaffirmed a woman's right to abortion services without facing an undue burden imposed by the state.Significantly, Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt has not rejected all state regulations of abortion procedures. Earlier, in 2011, the Texas legislature passed and the courts upheld a law requiring doctors who perform abortions to provide a sonogram to women before carrying out the procedure.The law requires doctors to provide with the sonogram "a simultaneous verbal explanation of the results of the live, real-time sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of arms, legs, external members, and internal organs." Doctors are also required to make the fetus's heartbeat audible to the woman. Pregnant women affected by the law may choose not to view the sonogram, listen to the doctor's explanations, or listen to the heartbeat. However, doctors who refuse to comply with the law are subject to losing their licenses to practice medicine. Doctors are not required to perform the sonogram procedure for women who were impregnated as a result of rape or incest.Proponents of Texas's law argue that because abortion involves a nascent human life, efforts to make women think twice about going forward with an abortion should be implemented. They believe that the state has a compelling interest to protect the lives of what they consider to be human beings in the earliest stages of development. Supporters emphasize that women can still go forward with a legal abortion if they so choose, but they should have full and complete information about the consequences of the decision they are making. Elizabeth Graham, the director of Texas Right to Life, adds, "This paternalistic attitude, that we're saddling women with too much information, really does an injustice. . . . It underestimates the capability of women to make a decision with more information, not less." Opponents of the law argue that abortion is a constitutional right that has been protected by the Supreme Court and that, through forcing women to take the extra step of having a sonogram, the state is making it more difficult for women to exercise this right. They cite the Court's argument that no abortion law can place an undue burden on women who choose to obtain an abortion, and they note that the law makes women come into a medical office twice--once for the sonogram and again for the abortion after the 24-hour waiting period. In particular, opponents argue that vaginal ultrasounds invade a woman's privacy, as they necessarily involve an invasive procedure that women should not be required to endure. Jenni Beaver, assistant director at the Southwestern Women's Surgery Center in Dallas, argues that the sonogram law "treats women as if they are stupid and don't know what is in their uterus. . . . The law just creates hoops and barriers and drives up the cost for the women. And we have not had anyone decide not to have an abortion because of a sonogram."Do you believe abortions should be curtailed in Texas, and if so, is the sonogram law an effective way to achieve this goal?

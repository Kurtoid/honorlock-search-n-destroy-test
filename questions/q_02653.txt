While riding a bike, Billy swerved to miss a pot hole and ran into the rear of parked car. It turns out, the car was in neutral and at the top of a hill. It starts rolling down the hill and runs into a semi-truck stalled in the intersection that was hauling gasoline. The resulting explosion sends shards of metal into a house next to the intersection where a terrorist cell was just putting the finishing touches on a dirty bomb (nuclear infused bomb). The metal shards start the reaction for the bomb to go off and the town of Laramie is eliminated off the map. The wonderful Wyoming wind carries nuclear fallout to Cheyenne and 500 people develop cancer as a result. Billy took cover in the pothole and miraculously survived the blast with minor abrasions. For what will Billy (or his parents) likely be held liable?

Problem 2 (50 pts) A NASA engineer wants to modify the experimental apparatus in Problem 1 by adding a thin quartz glass over the small cutout to allow the laser to enter. The glass has a thickness of 2 mm and a diameter of 3 mm, which is the  diameter of laser. The glass is well-insulated at the radial edges.  The imaginary component of the refractive index is k = 1.0888 x 10-8. The thermal conductivity of the glass is kglass, and the emittance at l > 4 mm is eglass. Neglect all reflections (external and internal) and external radiation from the inside and outside of the glass,. Assuming an absorbing only medium at the wavelength the laser is transmitted, complete the following:  The transmission through the quartz glass; setup with boundary conditions the 1D temperature distributions through the glass at steady-state but DO NOT solve; and briefly discuss the impact of the given problem assumptions.

This is a simple exercise of objects, classes, and inheritance. In this exercise, you need to create a class, Transaction, and two of its subclasses: OnlineTransaction and PhoneTransaction. You also need to create another class to host the main method. In the superclass Transaction, define the following:*        A (private) integer variable for the transaction ID;*        A (private) double variable for the transaction amount;*        A constructor method with two arguments to initialize the two instance variables;*        A (public) method to set the transaction ID; *        A (public) method to set the transaction amount;*        A (public) method to retrieve the transaction ID;*        A (public) method to retrieve the transaction amount;*        A (public) method to print the transaction information (i.e., transaction ID, amount) into a file     o   The method takes an object of PrintWriter as its argument     o   The method writes the following information into the output file via the PrintWriter object:             Transaction ID: 1001       Amount: 100.00          Note: For simplicity, throughout this question, you do NOT need to worry about the formatting of the output. You can simply use println() without any format specifier; you can also use printf() with format specifiers if you like. Either way, make sure you are using the correct syntax accordingly.*        Don't forget an import statement to incorporate the class definition of PrintWriter.  In the subclass OnlineTransaction, in addition to the inherited variables and methods, define the following:*        A (private) String variable for the reference source (i.e., where this online transaction comes from, e.g., "Direct Visit", "Google", "Email", etc.);*        A constructor method with three arguments to initialize all instance variables (id, amount, reference);*        A (public) method to print the transaction information into a file, overriding the same method in the superclass.      o   The method takes an object of PrintWriter as its argument     o   The method writes the following information into the output file via the PrintWriter object:            Transaction ID: 1001   Amount: 100.00  Type: Online    Reference: Google          Note: Type "Online" can be printed as is, but the reference source needs to be the actual value of the "reference" variable of each OnlineTransaction object.*        Don't forget an import statement to incorporate the class definition of PrintWriter.  In the subclass PhoneTransaction, in addition to the inherited variables and methods, define the following:*        A (private) double variable for the service fee for transactions completed over the phone;*        A constructor method with three arguments to initialize all instance variables (id, amount, fee);*        A (public) method to print the transaction information into a file, overriding the same method in the superclass.      o   The method takes an object of PrintWriter as its argument     o   The method writes the following information into the output file via the PrintWriter object:             Transaction ID: 1001   Amount: 100.00  Type: Phone    Fee: 5.00          Note: Type "Phone" can be printed as is, but the service fee needs to be the actual value of the "fee" variable of each PhoneTransaction object.*        Don't forget an import statement to incorporate the class definition of PrintWriter. In the main method:*        Create and initialize a PrintWriter object, which writes into the output file "output.txt". *        Create an array of four (4) elements, in the type of Transaction objects.*        Instantiate the four array elements, one by one, as objects of appropriate subclasses, according to the following information.         Transaction ID: 1001    Amount: 100.00 Type: Online       Reference: Google         Transaction ID: 1002    Amount: 5000.00 Type: Online       Reference: Email         Transaction ID: 1003    Amount: 800.00 Type: Phone       Fee: 5.00         Transaction ID: 1004    Amount: 200.00 Type: Phone       Fee: 8.00*        Use a loop to access all array elements. In each iteration, call the method that prints the information of each transaction into the output file. Properly pass in the PrintWriter object as the argument of the method.*        Close the PrintWriter object in the end of the main method.*        Your main method is likely to throw FileNotFoundException. Properly declare that.*        Don't forget the import statements to incorporate the class definitions of PrintWriter and FileNotFoundException.

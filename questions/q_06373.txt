Match the following meaning to the medical abbreviation: GASTRO
Amino acids include a side chain as well as ________.
Cell growth liberates energy which must be removed; otherwise, the temperature will rise so much that the cells may be killed. In a continuous fermenter for the production of Penicillium chrysogenum, the cells generate 27.6 kJ/L per hour, and the volume of the well-insulated fermenter is 2.0L. The feed temperature of a coolant gas is 25oC and the exit temperature is equal to the temperature in the fermenter. Penicillium chrysogenum cannot grow above 43o Will the cell survive? Justify your answer with proper calculations. Assume for simplicity that the coolant inlet and the outlet streams have a heat capacity of 4.0 J/g/ oC and the mass flow rates of 1025 g/hr are constant. (Don't forget to draw a diagram, write down the general energy balance equation, and simplify the EB eq.)     If your well-insulated fermenter were 5.0L instead, how fast will the coolant need to be flowing to ensure the cells stay alive.     If you were not able to change the flow rate of the coolant (i.e., same as in #1), describe two other ways you could still maintain the temperature in the 5L fermenter below 42oC to keep the cells alive? (no math.)

True or False: There are four things you must complete in order to gain access to the video lecture quizzes and the exams in this course.  You must earn a grade of 95% or better on the START HERE quiz in order to gain access to the rest of the course. You must submit the pdf of the full report results from the SmarterMeasure evaluation. Instructions are found in the Online Preparedness sub-module. You must complete the mock exam AND upload your scratch work to the dropbox provided. These are found in the Honorlock sub-module. You must install Microsoft Teams on your phone, reply to the introduction message, and then upload a screen pic of your reply to the dropbox in the Class Communication Policies sub-module.  If you do not complete these four items, you will not have access to assignments which are for point credit in this course. Not having access due to not complete the four items above is NOT an excuse for missing due dates; you will get zeroes for any assignments which are not completed by the due date. The answer is True.

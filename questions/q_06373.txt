Another striking set of symptoms in COVID-19 patients centers on the brain and central nervous system (meningitis and encephalitis). Frontera (an attending physician) says neurologists are needed to assess 5% to 10% of coronavirus patients at her hospital. ACE2 receptors are present in the neural cortex and brain stem, says Robert Stevens, an intensive care physician at Johns Hopkins Medicine. A cytokine storm could also cause brain swelling, and the blood's exaggerated tendency to clot could trigger strokes.   A 58-year-old woman with COVID-19 developed encephalitis, resulting in tissue damage in the brain (arrows) N. POYIADJI ET AL., RADIOLOGY, (2020) Many people think COVID-19 kills 1% of patients, and the rest get away with some flulike symptoms. But the story gets more complicated. Many people will be left with chronic kidney and heart problems. Even their neural system is disrupted. There will be hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, possibly more, who will need treatments such as renal dialysis for the rest of their lives. The more we learn about the coronavirus, the more questions arise. We are learning while we are sailing. In your innate immunity class, we have discussed a type of modified white blood cells found in the brain which can cross the blood-brain barrier and can release these cytokines. What is the name of these white blood cells?

Write your answers in the sheet(s) provided. Refer to the figure or diagram to answer the question. Where explanation or discussion is required, support your answers with relevant information and/or specific examples.   (a) The consequences of a growing human population have been a concern since the times of Thomas Malthus when he proposed that humans could exceed their carrying capacity on Earth.  (i) Describe the concept of carrying capacity for a species.   (ii) Describe how a change in the availability of a specific resource can affect the carrying capacity of a species.    (b) As the human population grows, forests are often clear-cut.  (i) Describe one negative effect of clear-cutting forested areas.   (ii) Besides creating or expanding forest preserves, describe one mitigation strategy that humans can employ to reduce the negative impact of human population growth on forests.   (iii) Describe an additional benefit of the mitigation strategy in described in (b)(ii).    (c) As a country industrializes, it often moves through a demographic transition. The model below illustrates the changes through the four stages of the demographic transition.   (i) Based on the model, identify the stage in the demographic transition with the greatest change in crude birth rate.   (ii) Based on the model, describe the relationship between the crude death rate and the crude birth rate that led to the trend in total population in stage 2.   (iii) Explain one likely social or economic cause for the change in the crude birth rate illustrated in stage 3.        (d) During a demographic transition, intensive agricultural practices used to feed a growing population can result in soil eroding from crop fields and running off into surface waters.  (i) Make a claim that proposes an effective, long-term solution to minimize the erosion of topsoil into surface waters.   (ii) Justify the claim made in (d)(i) by explaining and additional benefit to the proposed solution, other than preventing the erosion of topsoil.
The following code generates pink noise.  Add a volume analyzer and set the volume of the noise as the background of the  display window.  You need to scale the volume up as the analyzer only return a value between 0 and 1. import processing.sound.*; PinkNoise noise; void setup() { size(640, 360); background(255); // Create the noise generator noise = new PinkNoise(this); noise.play(); } void draw() { }

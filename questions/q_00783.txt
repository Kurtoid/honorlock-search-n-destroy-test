Case Excerpt for Question 20 The following instructions were given to the jury regarding the substantial factor test: "A substantial factor in causing harm is a factor that a reasonable person would consider to have contributed to the harm. It must be more than a remote or trivial factor. It does not have to be the only cause of the harm." The plaintiff argues that this definition is vague and that it misled the jury.

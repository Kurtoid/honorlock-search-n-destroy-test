Create a new kind of Dice class that can be used to create a dice object having a randomly determined number of sides (up to a maximum of 10). Write your class below to meet the following specifications. The Dice class should have (at least) two instance variables and a constant:  An appropriately named int variable for the number of sides. An int variable for the current face value of the dice. An int constant for the maximum number of sides (10).  The Dice class should have a single no-parameter constructor that  Generates a random number of sides. Assigns this generated value to the appropriate instance variable. Initializes the current face value to 1.  The Dice class should have two methods.  A  roll method that generates a randomly calculated face value, that is, a random number from 1 up to the number of sides on the dice.  The method assigns this value to the face value instance variable, and also returns the value from the method. An  equals method properly overriding that from the Object class. Two dice should be equal if they have the same number of sides and the same face value.  Notes:  You can add instance variables or methods if you want, but you don't need to. There's no need to import anything. Recall the useful nextInt(int j) method of the Random class that returns an integer from 0 to j-1.

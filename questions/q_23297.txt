Moss Co. had credit sales of $280,000 in 2020.  The allowance for doubtful accounts had a balance of $3,100 on 1/1/20, and during the year, Moss wrote-off $3,600 of uncollectible accounts.  At the end of the year they had an accounts receivable balance of $38,200.  Prior experience suggests that 3% of net credit sales will be uncollectible. What would Moss report as the net realizable value of accounts receivable on its 2020 balance sheet?

(1). Draw a figure and describe how RFID works? Illustrate its potential applications.  (10pts)   (2). Introduce the frequency hopping spread system and its advantages.  (10pts)   (3). Given a bit sequence 00100110 as follows. The time period of each bit is 2/f1, where f1 is the carrier frequency. Draw their ASK, FSK, BPSK, DPSK modulated output wave respectively. For ASK and PSK, the carrier is assumed to be sin(2pf1t). For FSK, the carrier is sin(2pf1t) for bit 0 and is sin(2pf2t) for bit 1, f1=1/2*f2. For DPSK, the first bit is modulated by sin(2pf1t). (10pts)      (4). What is the basic idea of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the time domain? Why do we need the OFDM? (10pts)           (5). The first figure above demonstrates the framework of the ZigBee transmitter. The second figure above shows the symbol-to-chip mapping happening in the DSSS block in the ZigBee transmitter.  Assume the data bits coming from the MAC layer are ...10100111,  please answer the following questions: (20pts)       (5a).

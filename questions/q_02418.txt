Order these major taxonomic categories into an increasingly inclusive hierarchy.
Which of the following would undergo secondary succession?
Label your answers A. and B.   This is a serious and common complication of myocardial disease in cats. Clinical signs will include: acute rear limb pain and paresis, cold foot pads that may have a blue tint to them, and a femoral pulse cannot be palpated. The diagnosis is based off the clinical signs and if available, an angiogram can be done. Treatment involves TPA and heparin.   A. What is this condition called?   B. How does the administration of TPA help patients with this condition (i.e.: What does the TPA do)?

What does NOT form the respiratory membrane?
A disk has mass m = 5 kg, outer radius Ro = 3.5 m, Ri = 2m, and mass moment of inertia .  The disk rolls without slipping on its inner radius at point B.  A cord is wrapped around the inner radius and passes over a massless pulley of radius rP = 0.2 m and is connected to a hanging mass mF = 2 kg. In addition to the cord, there is a force P = 50 N acting tangentially and horizontally to the outer radius of the disk.  Give the equations that must be solved in order to determine the initial acceleration of the disk, aC, when released from rest. You need not solve the equations, but give all force and moment balance relations and all kinematic equations necessary to describe the system.  Clearly indicate the unknowns in your equations.

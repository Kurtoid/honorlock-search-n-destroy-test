3.4   The following diagram shows a plant with variegated leaves. The plant was destarched by leaving it in the dark for 24 hours. Leaf X then had a strip of black paper attached to both the upper and lower surfaces. It was then sealed in a flask containing a solution of sodium hydroxide, a substance that absorbs carbon dioxide. Leaf Y also had a strip of black paper attached to both the upper and lower surfaces. The plant was then placed in the light for 24 hours and then a starch test was carried out on leaf X and leaf Y.

Read the following passage from "A New Home for NASA's Biological and Physical Sciences Research."  Then, based on your reading of the passage, choose the most appropriate answer to the question that follows the passage. You may be asked other questions about the same passage. Growing Plants in Space The Vegetable Production System, known as Veggie, is a space garden residing on the space station. Veggie helps NASA study plant growth in microgravity while adding fresh food to the astronauts' diet, which can enhance happiness and well-being on the orbiting laboratory. The most current study, Veg-04A, focuses on the impact of light quality and fertilizer on leafy crop growth for a 28-day grow-out, microbial food safety, nutritional value, taste acceptability by the crew, and the overall behavioral health benefits of having plants and fresh food in space. Mizuna mustard, a leafy green crop, was grown for 28 days under two different light quality treatments in space, and the impact on crop growth was analyzed in terms of the differences observed in plant yield, nutritional composition and microbial levels. One goal in these experiments is to grow leafy greens with high harvest index--meaning, most of the plant is edible. What's next for Veggie? Researchers will be testing the suitability of other plants, especially leafy greens, for crew consumption, and Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) will be growing radish and investigating underlying mechanisms of how plants grow differently in space.

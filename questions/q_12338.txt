Bioluminescence is an ability of many ocean-dwelling organisms that allows them to produce light in their bodies via complex chemical reactions.  These reactions are very costly to the organism in terms of energy consumption so it is important that organisms get the most "bang for their buck" by producing light that can be seen better/farther than any other light and that's exactly what they do.  Therefore, what color of light is produced most frequently and in greatest abundance by ocean bioluminescent organisms?

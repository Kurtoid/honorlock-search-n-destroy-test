Boundary testing  Suppose we are to test an income tax calculation system.  The input to the system contains two numbers, (X, Y).  X is an integer. If X = 1, it means single filing; X = 2, for married filing; other numbers are invalid.  Y represents the income of the filing and must be a nonnegative integer. Round the tax to integer. Design test cases to cover all boundaries for this system.  Some invalid test cases must also be designed.  Note: a test case should contain both input and expected output, i.e., ((X, Y), tax). You should test the cases above, on, and below the boundary.

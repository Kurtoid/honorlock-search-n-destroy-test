An experiment consists of casting a pair of dice and observing the number that falls uppermost on each die. We may represent each outcome of the experiment by an ordered pair of numbers, the first representing the number that appears uppermost on the first die and the second representing the number that appears uppermost on the second die. Consider the sample spaceS = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6),         (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6),         (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6),         (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6),         (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6),         (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)}Determine the event that the number that falls uppermost on the first die is greater than the number that falls uppermost on the second die.          a.    {(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)}         b.    {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (5, 6)}         c.    {(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5)}         d.

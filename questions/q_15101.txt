A defibrillator passes a brief burst of current through the heart to restart normal beating. In one such defibrillator, a 50 mF capacitor is charged to 6.0 kV. Paddles are used to make an electric connection to the patient's chest. A pulse of current lasting 1.0 ms partially discharges the capacitor through the patient. The electrical resistance of the patient (from paddle to paddle) is 240 O. How much energy is dissipated in the patient during this discharge time?

In a population of 550 guinea pigs, the coats can be either rough or smooth.  Of this population, in which rough coat is dominant to smooth coat, approximately 230 individuals have smooth coat.  Assuming that the population is at equilibrium for this gene/locus, answer the following. Part A: 1. Calculate the allele frequencies and genotype frequencies (p,2pq, etc.).  Perform all calculations to three decimal places.   (Note: you will NOT be scored on part A, but your work in part A, will be required to do Part B and should be included in your evidence of work. I need to see how you got these values to calculate Part B.)   Part B: BONUS: After the previous predictions were made, actual samples were obtained from all individuals in the population described above.  Genetic analyses were done, and it was found that of those that were rough, 120 are homozygous dominant and 200 are heterozygous.  Is the population above at equilibrium? Use the chi-square test to determine this.   (The chi-square formula and chart is shown below the questions for convenience.) Answer the following:  1. What was the chi-square value? 2. What was the df (degree of freedom) that you used? 3. Did you accept or reject the hypothesis? Why? 4. Is the population at equilibrium? Why or why not?
The design of different spectrophotometers depends on the type of measurement (e.g. atomic emission, atomic absorption, uv-vis absorption, fluorescence) they are intended to make. Image the table below is a block diagram of the components for atomic absorption equipment, indicate what is 1,2,3,4 and 5.    1 2 3 4 5
The question of the legalization and/or decriminalization of drugs is a controversial topic that elicits strong opinions on both sides of the topic. Define both approaches and present and analyze some of the arguments that have been offered in support of each. Explain the limitation model and give examples of it. Explain whether or not you are in favor of the legalization, decriminalization, and/or limitation of drugs and support your opinion with facts and data where appropriate.
A research team lead by Dr John Schorling, at University of Virginia School of Medicine conducted a study to understand the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors in central Virginia for African Americans. According to their recent research, several parameters such as BMI, age, cholesterol level, and waist/hip ratio can be used as the predictors of glucose level (Blood sugar level). They recorded the data and it can be found in the excel file attached. They asked us to create a model which can predict the effect of each of those variables on prediction of glucose level (blood sugar level), with significance level of 0.10. Please create that model and report your interpretation about the significance of each variable. More information about definition of each variable:  Glucose level: Blood sugar level can consequently result in diabetes. We want to evaluate the effect of 4 other variables on this variable. BMI: Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can be an indicator of high body fatness. BMI can be used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems but it is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual. age: the age of each participant in years. cholesterol level: It is measured in the units of mg/dL waist/hip ratio: the ratio between the waist size over hip size is a variable defined to evaluate the overweight of the subjects.  P.S. The excel file attached includes the raw data and you may need to do minor calculations to obtain the exact variables for your prediction model.

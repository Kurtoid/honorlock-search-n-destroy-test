6. [30 points] A backhoe with a 2-cy bucket will be used for excavating the basement of a building. The dimensions of the basement are 200 ft wide, 450 ft long and 9 ft deep. The earth is hard, tough clay. The backhoe will load earth into 18-cy, loose measure, trucks that will haul the earth 15 miles to a waste dump. The average haul speed will be 30 mi/hr and return speed of 45 mi/hr. For each truck assume a fixed time of 5 min to dump a load and wait at the basement area to be loaded. The cost of the backhoe, with operator is $105.00/hr and the cost of each truck, with driver, is $65.00/hr. Assume a 45-min effective hour for the loading and hauling operation. Estimate: a. Quantity of work (lcy) [6 points] b. Production rate of backhoe (lcy/hr). Note: You need to consider the fill factor of the backhoe buckets [6 points] c. Cycle time of one truck (hr/trip) [6 points] d. Number of truck required to balance the production rate of backhoe [6 points] e. How many truck should be used to minimize the unit cost of labor ($/lcy)? [6 points]

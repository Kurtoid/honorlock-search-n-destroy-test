A recently discovered bacterium carries out ATP synthesis coupled to the flow of electrons through a chain of carriers to some electron acceptor. The components of its electron transfer chain differ from those found in mitochondria; they are listed below with their standard reduction potentials (E'deg).     Oxidant   Reductant    E'deg(V)      NAD+    NADH   -0.32     flavoprotein b (FPb)(oxidized)   flavoprotein b (FPb) (reduced)   -0.62     cyt c (Fe3+) (oxidized)   cyt c (Fe2+) (reduced)   +0.22     Fe-S protein (Fe-S) (oxidized)   Fe-S protein (Fe-S) (reduced)   +0.89     flavoprotein a (FPa) (oxidized)   flavoprotein a (FPa)(reduced)   +0.77     The electron carriers are most likely to act in carrying electrons in the order:
Describe the mechanism by which phototropism takes place and the role of auxins.
For the Dining Philosophers Problem (DPP) with 5 Philosophers discussed in class, the following code segment can represent the actions of a philosopher, where chopstick[i] is the semaphore representing the ith chopstick. Assume there are 5 semaphores, each representing one chopstick in the system.  do { wait (chopstick[i] );wait (chopStick[ (i + 1) % 5] );// eatsignal (chopstick[i] );signal (chopstick[ (i + 1) % 5] );// think} while (TRUE); Referring to DPP as described above, What are the initial values of semaphore array chopstick[5]?

Figure 1 shows three different loops in the program and how they progress over time in the frequency domain.    Frequency of the first loop is f1=100 MHz, frequency of the second loop is f2=50 MHz, and frequency of the third loop is f3=75 MHz.  Calculate how much time it takes to complete one iteration of each of three loops. Calculate spacing between two blue lines in the spectrogram marked as x.

Problem 4a) Finite State Machines ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate Fill your answer into the box provided. You can stretch the box to make it larger using the symbol in the bottom right corner. The tool bar has indent functions. In 4a), 4b), and 4c)  we will write a finite state machine (FSM) named FSM011 for the problem defined. It will find the sequence 011 embedded in an arbitrary sequence of bits wherever it occurs (use variable x), overlapping. Generate an output Z=2'd3 whenever this sequence is detected, otherwise Z=2'd1. Use a standard Finite state machine design organized in problem 4 parts a), b), and c) which is below. Inputs must be x, reset, clk, and outputs must be State, and Z.  A state transition table (which contains the same information as a state diagram) is supplied in 4c) In this problem 4a) write   the module statement,  a localparam statement that does a state assignment, and  any declarations of local variables.   Be complete. You can look forward to 4b) and 4c) to see the entire problem if that helps. For maximum credit your code should carefully follow the specification, and your grade will depend that. Use the minimum number of lines to accomplish this specification. Use System Verilog, always_ff, and always_comb, and don't use reg datatype. Also use proper indentation for organization. Give one clear answer, problems with multiple answers will be counted incorrect. All code should be efficiently designed and written in a well-organized fashion with indentation and should avoid errors and warnings, and particularly without inferred latches or multiply driven variables. Do not use compiler directives. ASU (C) do not post copy or duplicate

Changing the rainfall has a significant effect on the beak size of the island's finches. Little rainfall, causes the small seeds on the island to die out. This leaves the large seeds as the main food source. This allows birds with large beaks to break open these seeds, eat them, and live long enough to have children who may inherit the large beak trait. Since finches with large beaks are able to eat large seeds, they will have an advantage in this environment. Over time, the population will have more finches with large beaks. Select which graph represents the change in beak size of finches after 100 generations of drought. The dotted line represents the finch population in the first generation. The solid line represents the finch population after 100 generations.

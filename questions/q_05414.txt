The trade show is open Monday through Sunday, from 9 am until 9 pm daily.  Approximately 6,000 trade show attendees will visit your booth during the show.  While 9,000 people will attend the show during the week, only 4,000 are within your target market.  Past data reveals that 60% of the attendees visit a majority of the booths at this show.  Of those that visit your booth, 2,000 are in your target market.  Your booth staff will average 6 minutes speaking with each contact.  You will need an additional 57 square feet for private places, storage, etc.  Exhibiting at the show will generate qualified sales leads that will be directly responsible for 100 new sales for the firm.  You may assume that your staff speaks with all that are included in your attraction efficiency.  The averages across all industries and product types apply in this situation.  Round up to the nearest square foot.   Your formula for trade show booth size is: (Attendance * Product Interest % * A.I.F. * 50) / (Show Hours * Salesperson Rate)   What is your conversion efficiency? (enter your answer as a percentage, i.e., 12.4, or 73.8, etc.)

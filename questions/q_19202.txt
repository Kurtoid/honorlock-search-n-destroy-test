Read the following to answer Questions 18-22 Reflection of Solar RadiationOn average, about half of the sunlight that strikes Earth's atmosphere reaches the surface of the planet to be absorbed and converted into heat.  This absorbed light is a key factor in determining Earth's temperature and weather.  Also, it is crucial for the normal functioning of Earth's greenhouse effect. The other half of the sunlight that strikes Earth's atmosphere is either absorbed by the atmosphere before it reaches the surface or reflected back into space by clouds or by Earth's surface itself.  The amount of sunlight that is reflected back into space in a particular place depends mainly on how thick the clouds are and whether Earth's surface is dark or light.  The figure below shows how much energy is reflected back into space with different thicknesses of cloud cover and different types of surface on Earth.

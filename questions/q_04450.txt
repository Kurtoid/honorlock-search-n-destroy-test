Which of the following statements correctly describes the primary difference between enhancers and proximal control elements?
(For all students) The figure below shows a rigid rod, mass m, length 2L, and moment of inertia IG, supported in a guide at one end. The bar is attached to a spring of stiffness k at that end. Use the generalized coordinates xG (the x location of the center of mass of the bar), yG (the y location of the center of mass of the bar), and q  (the angular rotation of the bar from vertical). Assume the spring is unstretched when xG = 0 and q = 0. Find  the constraint equation the coefficient(s) of the Lagrange multiplier(s) Indicate how these are used in Lagrange's equations of motion for the generalized coordinates xG, yG, and q.

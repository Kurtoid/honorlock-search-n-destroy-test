1.6   High risk food should not be left in the temperature danger zone for longer than ________ hours.   (1)

Give the full name of the depression/space labeled A. Ignore label B. (Note: the image is showing the anterior view.)
A certain system uses two-factor authentication. Let the first method be A1 and the second one  A2. Also, assume that the guessing entropy for A1 is e1 bits and the guessing entropy for A2 is e2 bits.  If A1 and A2 are totally independent (compromise of A1 provides no help is compromising A2 and vice versa), what will be the total entropy of the two-factor method that uses both A1 and A2? (5 pts.)  Now consider the password hardening paper discussed in class. A1 is defined by the user password and A2 is defined by the keystroke timing derived hardening features. In this case, can A1 and A2 be considered independent?  Provide a brief explanation for your answer. (6 pts.)  Sensors these days can also measure the pressure with which a key is pressed. If we add such sensors to keyboards and the password hardening system, we can also define an additional feature based on the pressure measured when each key is pressed. If the password is n characters long, what would be the best case hardening entropy (entropy only due to the keystroke timing and pressure derived features) in this system. (6 pts.)  Assume as users gain more experience typing the same text string, they become faster. Assume Bob is a slow user but his password typing pattern gradually changes and he becomes fast after sufficient number of successful logins. If  consecutive timing measurements are very close (i.e., gradual change), does the password hardening algorithm adapt to this slow change of timing values and allow Bob to log into the system on each request? If an attacker has knowledge of such user typing behavior, what time is better for the attacker to target Bob's account (early when Bob is slow, late when Bob is fast or in between)? (10 pts.)

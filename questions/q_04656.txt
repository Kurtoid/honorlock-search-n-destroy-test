Re: Between 2010-2019, every three years, researchers selected a random sample of graduating Bachelor's in Social Work (BSW) students from 20 universities across the United States, to survey their level of financial debt, intention to obtain graduate-level education, and overall career plans. The researchers then reported on and compared these rates over time.  -------------------------------------------------------- In 2015, the researchers decided to explore some relationships across the variables in their study.   They found a relationship between students' intentions to continue on to graduate school and their level of monetary debt to be: r = - 0.36, p < 0.01.   Next, when these researchers included BSW students' parents' educational attainment in the analysis, the relationship between students' debt and intentions regarding graduate education (noted in Q. 6) changed from r= -0.36 to r = -0.16, with a new p-value of .12). Based on this latest finding, the researchers should consider that the relationship between student debt and intentions regarding graduate education may be:

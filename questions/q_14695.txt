You have isolated two separate yeast mutants that have a reduced ability to sporulate (cannot complete meiosis).  One mutant contains a mutation in the Spo11 gene, the other contains a mutation in the gene that encodes resolvase. A) Briefly describe (in one or two sentences) the function of each enzyme in Homologous Recombination. B) The resolvase mutant has a second phenotype: this mutant is more susceptible to X-rays. However, the Spo11 mutant is NOT more susceptible to X-rays than normal, even though both mutations affect Homologous Recombination. Can you explain this result?  In your answer, state the type of DNA damage induced by X-rays. C) You told your labmate about your Spo11 mutant.  He asked you "Why don't the DNA repair pathways fix the mutation in the Spo11 gene?  What should you tell him?

Consider a mass-spring-damper system, whose differential equation is shown below, where f(t) is an input force applied to the mass. Another department at our company, Real 1s Engineering, has already bought a damper with damping coefficient b, and the mass, m, is not subject to change. It is desired for the mass to reach its final position as quickly as possible with no overshoot. It is our job to choose a spring with spring constant k to achieve this. Find k. A schematic of the system is shown for your convenience. (Submit your work for partial credit.) (Hint: Not one number, not one problem)

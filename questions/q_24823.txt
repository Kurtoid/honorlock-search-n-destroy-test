Beta sought to purchase 100 motors from Alpha to use in manufacturing motorboats. Beta needed motors that produced at least 50 horsepower, and Bea, the Beta purchasing agent explained this to Al, the Alpha sales manager. Al said, "the X25 will be perfect, and I can sell them to Beta for $175 each. Bea liked the price, but asked, "doesn't the Alpha catalogue expressly state that the X25 only produces 45 horsepower?" Al replied, "yeah, but the catalogue is wrong. Every X25 produces at least 55 horsepower. You can count on it--this is the perfect motor for your needs." Immediately following the conversation, Alpha and Beta executed a written contract for 100 X25 motors. The written contract incorporated all the information in the catalogue and contained a merger clause. The motors, as delivered, produced only 45 horsepower. Is Beta entitled to reject them?

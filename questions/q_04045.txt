To test the effectiveness (i.e., the influence on memory) of the herbal mixture, a skeptical researcher obtains a sample of n = 36 people and requests that each person take the suggested dosage each day for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4-week period, each individual takes a standardized memory test (large numbers indicate better memory). The scores from the sample produced a mean of M = 32. In the general population, the standardized memory test is known to have a mean of u = 30 and s = 6. Do the sample data support the conclusion that the herbal supplement improved memory?

Dean Company's net incomes for the past three years are presented below (ignore taxes):                          2022                2021                2020                         $480,000         $450,000         $360,000 During the 2022 year-end audit, the following items come to your attention: 1. Dean bought equipment on January 1, 2019 for $490,000 with a $40,000 estimated salvage value and a six-year life. The company debited an expense account and credited cash on the purchase date for the entire cost of the asset. (Straight-line method)  During 2022, Dean changed from the straight-line method of depreciating its cement plant to the double-declining balance method. The following computations present depreciation on both bases:                                                     2022                2021                2020        Straight-line                       36,000             36,000             36,000       Double-declining                46,080             57,600             72,000 The net income for 2022 was computed using the double-declining balance method, on the January 1, 2022 book value, over the useful life remaining at that time. The depreciation recorded in 2022 was $72,000.  Dean, in reviewing its provision for uncollectibles during 2022, has determined that 1% is the appropriate amount of bad debt expense to be charged to operations. The company had used 1/2 of 1% as its rate in 2020 and 2021 when the expense had been $18,000 and $12,000, respectively. The company recorded bad debt expense under the new rate for 2022. The company would have recorded $6,000 less of bad debt expense on December 31, 2022 under the old rate.  Required: (a)    Prepare in general journal form the entry necessary to correct the books for the transaction in part 1 of this problem, assuming that the books have not been closed for the current year. (b)    Compute the net income to be reported each year 2020 through 2022. Ignore taxes. (c)    Assume that the beginning retained earnings balance (unadjusted) for 2020 was $1,260,000. At what adjusted amount should this beginning retained earnings balance for 2020 be stated, assuming that comparative financial statements were prepared? (d)        Assume that the beginning retained earnings balance (unadjusted) for 2022 is $1,800,000 and that non-comparative financial statements are prepared. At what adjusted amount should this beginning retained earnings balance be stated?

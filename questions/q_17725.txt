Read the following selection and the statements that follow. Select ja if the response is correct and nein if the response is incorrect. Harald und Manfred gehen fast jeden Samstag in die Stadt. Manchmal, wie auch heute, treffen sie Elke und Franziska. Alle vier sind Schulfreunde. Harald schlagt vor, dass sie zum Eiscafe Roma gehen sollen. Aber Manfred hat eine andere Idee. Er meint, es kostet dort zu viel und schlagt vor, dass sie doch lieber einen Film im Regina-Palast sehen sollen. Das finden auch alle gut. Dort lauft jetzt ein amerikanischer Film vom Wilden Westen. Er lauft schon zwei Wochen. Der Film fangt um halb sechs an. Deshalb haben sie noch etwas Zeit. Franziska hat Hunger und sagt ihren Schulfreunden, dass sie vor dem Film noch etwas essen mochte. Das meinen die anderen auch. Gleich um die Ecke vom Kino gibt es einen Imbiss. Dort essen sie Bratwurst und Hamburger und trinken Cola. Jetzt wird es langsam Zeit. Sie machen jetzt schnell. Der Film beginnt in zehn Minuten. Also, los!   Der Film lauft erst seit zwei Tagen.

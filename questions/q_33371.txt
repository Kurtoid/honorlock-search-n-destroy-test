Answer the following questions:. Submit everything on-line. (a) For a fault that can be dropped using global equivalent fault analysis, but is not dropped by using the labeling technique, which of the following process can find it easily to avoid unnecessary ATPG process: (a) test pattern generation, (b) fault simulation, (c) controllability/observability analysis, (d) design for testability. (b) Check point faults cannot be used to generate a fault list because some faults are dropped using (      ) relationship.  (c) Give two conditions under which D-algorithm will insert one node into its decision tree.    (d) Assume PODEM is used to generate a test pattern with the decision tree shown in Figure 5. Identify the backtracking where the logic value assigned to an input must be erased? (e) At lease how many iterations of fault simulations must be done using a 32-bit computer for a circuit with 1000,000 faults? You can just give the equation. (f) Which fault simulation method uses set operations, and which one uses the concept of good gate and bad gate simulations? (g) To perform timing verification of a scan chain for shift operation, the R and C values of each metal line used to connect two scan cells must be extracted from the VLSI layout to guarantee the correct functional and timing operations of the scan operations. Which test pattern must be used for static timing analysis?    (h) In Figure 6, if line L1 has a single stuck-at 0 fault, what problem will occur? If line L1 has a single stuck-at 1 fault, what problem will occur?
A client is being discharged from the hospital following evaluation for chest pain.  What information does the nurse include in a teaching plan for coronary artery disease (CAD) risk modification?
A 140-g block of copper is taken from a kiln and quickly placed into a beaker of negligible heat capacity containing 290 g of water. The water temperature rises from 6.8degC to 26.8degC. Given cCu = 0.10 cal/g[?]degC, and cwater = 1.00 cal/g[?]degC, what was the temperature of the kiln?
Kevin has an individual major medical policy that his insurer agrees to keep in force until age 65. However, the company has the right to increase the premium each year for the underwriting class in which Kevin has been placed. Which renewal provision is found in Kevin's policy?
Without Japan, about x% of US-TPP trade is with countries outside an existing US FTA; with Japan this number is y% for US merchandise trade and z% for US services trade. x,y,z are
Matching (2 points each)
Part (b). You explain to Bob that he needs a baseline to evaluate the models. Briefly describe a suitable baseline.
Which of the following is correct about the sole proprietorship?
7 - 9
Therapy patients should avoid pregnancy for how long after treatment--at a MINIMUM.
In reinforced Concrete design, the BALANCED reinforcing steel ratio is the value at which (choose an option):  tensile steel yields at the same time the extreme compression concrete fiber crushes (at concrete strain 0.003). tensile steel yields first and then the extreme compression concrete fiber crushes (at concrete strain 0.003). compression concrete crushes first (the extreme concrete fiber crushes at concrete strain 0.003) and then tensile steel yields. Concrete does not crush and steel does not yield None of the above
Could the findings be generalized to women who had any type of perineal surgery? Why or why not?
Which of the following is NOT an example of Monopolistic Competition?
Germicidal soaps are used in the hospital because they are excellent in sterilizing the patient before surgery.
Which EC2 Instances are now billed on a per second basis?
A cast has been applied to immobilize a right ulnar fracture.  Which of the following nursing interventions is most important?
Which of these bones would bear a ring? a. Phalanxb. Metacarpalc. Carpald. Tarsal
Your patient with COPD takes sustained release theophylline tablets 300 mg bid. To detect possible toxicity of theophylline you should monitor for signs and symptoms including:
You have a 200 ohm resistor, a 400 milli-H inductor, a 5.00 x 10-6 F capacitor, and a variable-frequency ac source with an amplitude of 3.00 V. You connect all four elements together to form a series circuit. At what frequency will the current in the circuit be greatest?

An insect population lives along the edge of a north-south mountain range. The populations from the east and west slope eventually join in a low northern pass and interbreed, producing fertile offspring; but they do not circle around the southern edge because of a desert barrier. When glaciers move southward, the populations are pushed south of the northern pass and are isolated. While isolated, the two populations develop enough differences over time that when the glaciers retreat north and the insects again share the same pass, they no longer mate at the same time, nor can they produce fertile offspring. These insects:

The study is interpreted as "suspicious for malignancy" by the radiologist. The patient asks you: "Does this mean I have cancer?", and you (correctly) answer "No, we have to do further testing." She then asks, "OK, I understand that the mammogram isn't the final answer, but given what we know now, what are the chances that I have breast cancer?"  Assume that the overall risk of breast cancer in any 45-year-old woman, regardless of mammogram result, is 0.1% or one in a thousand. Imagine: 10,000 women, 0.1% of whom have cancer: 9,990 women without cancer 10 women with cancer 8 women with a positive mammogram who have cancer 2 woman with a negative mammogram who has cancer 9490 women with a negative mammogram who do not have cancer 500 women with a positive mammogram who do not have cancer   Determine the PPV, include the formula, calculation and answer.

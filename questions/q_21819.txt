SECTION 3-A - Analysis (30 minutes)Galea Bruno works as a math teacher at a public high school. She and her fellow math and science teachers have, for years, held weekly conferences to exchange ideas about what is working well in their classes and what needs improvement - and have sometimes shared examples of class assignments, test score results, and other information about the school. They typically report any concerns they have to the faculty as a whole and the school administration, which then decides whether and how to respond to them. Bruno strongly opposes recent changes to the curriculum at the school, which she feels will students less well-prepared for college and less prepared - as she puts the concern - "to act as educated citizens in a democracy, and as humane members of the many knowledge communities they will be a part of." More specifically, she feels both that the mathematics and science curriculum and those in other subjects are "being made less challenging." At one of her monthly faculty meetings with fellow math and science teachers, Bruno angrily talks about, and then distributes a memo highlighting, her concerns. She begins the memo by noting that "she doesn't have to write this memo, but feels obligated to put these thoughts in writing so that she and other school staff can act on them." While most of the memo focuses on her concerns about math and science teaching, she also mentions examples of how she believes history and writing classes are "failing our students." She encounters skepticism from the school principal. Bruno then posts an online survey for fellow teachers, students, and their parents asking for their views on the quality of the curriculum and on the school's management of extracurricular. When she receives the results of this survey, she sends a copy of the results to a local newspaper. The school principal then fires Bruno for "acting contrary to the school's direction and contrary to the responsibilities of her job as a teacher." He claims that by voicing her complaints publicly, she "undermined the operation of the school, and created unjustified worry among parents and students - which not only caused them distress, but also caused increasing numbers of students to skip classes (because of the impression Bruno and some other teachers create that classes were a waste of their time). Bruno then sues the school for violating her First Amendment speech rights. Please write an essay setting out the arguments that the school would make and that Bruno would make in this legal dispute, discussing - as you do so - the key doctrinal questions a court would have to decide (and discussing what evidence from this fact pattern it would draw upon and what conclusions it might draw from, or questions it might ask about, this evidence).

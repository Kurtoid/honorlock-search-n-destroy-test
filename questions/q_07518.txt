Since both drivers are wearing their seatbelts and both vehicles are equipped with airbags, neither driver is seriously injured.  Assume that neither driver had time to apply the brakes before or during the collision. Immediately after the collision the two vehicles are stuck to each other, and the wheels are still rolling. The car has mass m=1,300 kg and is moving at v=81.0 mph, and the van has mass M=3,400 kg and is moving at V=70.0 mph.

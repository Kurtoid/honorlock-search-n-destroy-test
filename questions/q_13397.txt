Problem 4. (15 points) A rotating shaft, made of ductile material, is simply supported by bearings at A and C. The y-directional force at C is 6 kN. Also, the ultimate tensile strength and the yield strength of the shaft are Sut = 690 MPa and Syt = 580 MPa, respectively. The corrected endurance limit is Se = 236 MPa. Assume the strength at N=103 is 0.844xSut and the fatigue stress concentration factor is given as 1.5. Determine the minimum factor of safety for fatigue based on infinite life.    Write down the obtained factor of safety. [answer_fs]

On January 1, 2020 Chrome Co. signs an agreement with Fox enterprises to lease computer equipment. The term of the lease is 2 years, and payments are due on the December 31 of each year. The equipment has a fair value of $100,000, a residual value of $10,000 and 2 year economic life, and the cost to Fox was $70,000. Chrome has the option to purchase the equipment for $10,000 at the end of the lease, but it is not certain that they will do so, and they do not guarantee the the residual value. Chrome's incremental barrowing rate and Fox's desired return are both 5%. The present value factor of $1 over 2 periods at 5% is 0.90703, present value of an ordinary annuity for 2 periods at 5% is 1.85941, and the present value of an annuity due for 2 periods at 5% is 1.9524. Compute the annual lease payment amount that Fox will charge Chrome based on the information above? (answers are rounded)
Tree diameters are related to "growth rings" in trees and larger diameters are associated with taller trees. The scatter plot of a survey of 958 trees in an old-growth forest in Canada showed evidence of a linear relation between tree height (m) and diameter (cm).   The resulting least squares regression line equation  Height = 2.79 + 0.55x Diameter has an R2 value of 0.92. What does the least squares regression line equation predict for the height of a tree with a trunk diameter of 18 cm?  [a] (Round your answer to two decimal places.)

You have a 10 gram ice cube at a temperature of -20 degrees Celsius.  Fill in the blanks to show your work as you calculate the amount of thermal energy that must be exchanged to vaporize this ice cube.   Even though they are different in reality, please assume that the Specific Heat Capacity of water is the same for all of its phases. e., assume HCsolid = HCliquid = HCvapor = 1 cal/g/0C. Latent Heat of Vaporization = 540 cal/g Latent Heat of Fusion = 80 cal/g Pay attention to the units and understand if you're being asked for "calories," or "calories per gram," or "degrees," etc. Enter numeric values only. g., if the answer is seven, you would enter "7" not "seven." Do not enter any commas or decimal points. If the answer is one thousand, enter "1000" not "1,000" or "1000.0" etc. Do not enter any negative numbers. You are being asked to calculate the "total amount of energy that must be exchanged" so there is no need to use negative numbers.  DT for this transformation = [value1] 0C. Sensible Heat Required per gram for this transformation = [value2] cal/g. Total Sensible Heat Required for this transformation = [value3] cal. The phase change the water goes through requires [value4] cal/g. Total Latent Heat required for this transformation = [value5] cal. Total amount of Thermal Energy required to make this transformation = [value6] cal.

Jensen Company had the following inventory data for the year:    Jan. 1 Beginning inventory 1,000 units @ $2 = $2,000   Mar. 15 Purchase 5,000 units @ $2.50 = $12,500   June 30 Purchase 4,000 units @ $3 = $12,000   Oct. 1 Purchase 6,000 units @ $3.50 = $21,000    On December 31, there are 2,000 units of the item in the physical inventory. Calculate ending inventory on December 31 assuming Jensen uses LIFO.
